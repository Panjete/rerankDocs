investigating the likely association between genetic ancestry and covid-19 manifestation ranajit das sudeep ghate  the novel coronavirus 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 infection has shown discernible variability across the globe while in some countries people are recovering relatively quicker in others recovery times have been comparatively longer and numbers of those succumbing to it high in this study we aimed to evaluate the likely association between an individuals ancestry and the extent of covid-19 manifestation employing europeans as the case study we employed 10215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing 597573 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps pearsons correlation coefficient r between various ancestry proportions of european genomes and covid-19 deathrecovery ratio was calculated and its significance was statistically evaluated we found significant positive correlation p003 between european mesolithic hunter gatherers whg ancestral fractions and covid-19 deathrecovery ratio and a marginally significant negative correlation p006 between neolithic iranian ancestry fractions and covid-19 deathrecovery ratio we further identified 404 immune response related single nucleotide polymorphisms snps by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various european countries against 838 genomes from various eastern asian countries in a genome wide association study gwas prominently we identified that snps associated with interferon stimulated antiviral response interferon-stimulated gene 15 mediated antiviral mechanism and 2-5 oligoadenylate synthase mediated antiviral response show large differences in allele frequencies between europeans and east asians overall to the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating the likely association between genetic ancestry and covid-19 manifestation while our current findings improve our overall understanding of the covid-19 we note that the development of effective therapeutics will benefit immensely from a more detailed analyses of individual genomic sequence data from covid-19 patients of varied ancestries  the novel coronavirus 2019-ncovsars-cov-2 was officially identified on

catastrophic consequences notably covid-19 caused by 2019-ncov has shown significant worldwide variability especially in terms of the deathrecovery ratio that pertains to a ratio of the number of deaths caused by the novel coronavirus to numbers of infected individuals recovered within the same time interval while infected individuals from some countries have recovered relatively quickly with lower morbidities those from some other parts of the world appear to remain affected for longer with slower recovery times and demonstrate relatively higher deathrecovery ratios 2  this is suggestive of a likely population level genetic variation in terms of susceptibility to the coronavirus and covid-19 manifestation a case in point in this context appears to be ace2 that encodes for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 and has been speculated to be the host receptor for the novel coronavirus 3 4  recently cao et al analysed 1700 variants in ace2 from chinamap and 1000 genomes project databases 5  while they reported the absence of natural resistant mutations for coronavirus s-protein binding across their study populations their study revealed significant variation in allele frequencies af among the populations assessed including between people of east asian and european ancestries they speculated that the differences in afs of ace2 coding variants likely associated with its elevated expression may influence ace2 function and putatively impact sars infectivity among the evaluated populations additionally a majority of the 15 eqtl variants they identified had discernibly higher afs among east asian populations compared to europeans which may suggest differential susceptibility towards coronavirus in these two populations under similar conditions in addition to ace2 covid-19 manifestation may also be modulated by several immune response modulating genes li et al 2020 mentioned that coronavirus infection causes secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines such as il 1 il 6 il 8 il 21 tnf  and mcp 1 in the infected cells additionally the hosts major antiviral machinery comprising of interferons ifns may also the limit of coronavirus 6  overall it can be speculated that variations in host genes encoding for interleukins and interferons may be responsible for differential manifestation of covid-19 further recent studies have shown that variants associated with immune responsiveness display significant population-specific signals of natural selection 7  in particular the authors showed that admixture with neanderthals may have differentially shaped the immune systems in european populations introducing novel regulatory variants which may affect preferential responses to viral infections 7  european genomes were

variation in immune responses and its potential genetic and evolutionary determinants are poorly understood especially in the context of the novel coronavirus infection and covid-19 manifestation while covid-19 has affected huge numbers of individuals worldwide this pandemic has cause catastrophic damage in europe here we aimed to unravel the potential association between genetic ancestry and covid-19 employing europeans as the case study in addition using a genome wide association study gwas approach we sought to discern the putative snp markers and genes that may be likely associated with differential novel coronavirus infection by comparative analyses of the european and east asian genomes to this end we employed 10215 ancient and modern genomes obtained from the databank of dr david reich harvard medical school usa httpsreichhmsharvardedudatasets to evaluate the likely correlation between european ancestry and covid-19 our findings revealed significant positive correlation between whg-related ancestry and covid-19 deathrecovery ratio and marginally significant negative correlation between neolithic iranian ancestry and covid-19 finally we identified several snps that may influence immune responsiveness and displaying significant differential af between europeans and east asians our current results shine light on ancestry driven genetic factors underlying variabilities in covid-19 infection and manifestation it strongly advocates concerted sequencinggenotyping of covid-19 affected patients worldwide not only to expand and substantiate our current

high whg fraction among spanish populations interestingly the other iberian country portugal despite reporting fewer numbers of covid-19 cases compared to neighboring spain has a significantly high death to recovery ratio 393 underscoring the likely association between high whg ancestry proportions in iberians and the severity of covid-19 infection the whg ancestry proportion is discernibly high among the basque people in spain 339 and congruent with our hypothesis the death percentage in basque country is significantly higher compared to other spanish provinces httpswwwstatistacomstatistics1102882cases-of-coronavirus-confirmed-in-spain-in-2020-by-region  however owing to unavailability of data we were unable to calculate the death to recovery ratio in basque

between whg ancestry and the extent of covid-19 manifestation was observed for the uk where gbr genomes depicted high whg ancestry fractions 25 and was correlated with high covid-19 deathrecovery ratio in the country 3194 italy one of the worst hit countries with the covid-19 pandemic showed significant nationwide variation in the severity of disease manifestation deathrecovery ratio073 while covid-19 related deaths in northern italy has surpassed 12000 less than 1000 deaths have been so far reported in southern italy interestingly these numbers are consistent with whg fractions among italian genomes thus while whg ancestry fractions were found to be  231 and 92 among northern and southern italian genomes respectively in contrast only a handful of covid-19 cases have been so far reported in russia the largest country in the world and we assessed whether this is owing to their genomic make-up all modern-day russians originated from two groups of east slavic tribes northern and southern and have 0 whg ancestry fraction they are genetically similar to modern-day other slavic populations such as belarusians we note that covid-19 deathrecovery ratios are significantly low in both russia 013 and belarus 009 furthermore covid-19 manifestation was found to be far less detrimental in the central asian countries that were once part of former soviet union ussr such as kazakhstan death to recovery ratio016 kyrgyzstan 011 tajikistan 0 turkmenistan 0 and uzbekistan 008 finally finnish genomes that were shaped by migrations from siberia 3500 years ago 19 with no whg ancestral proportions have a relatively smaller covid-19 death to recovery ratio 008 overall our results have revealed a clear association between whg and neolithic iranian ancestry fractions and the acuteness of covid-19 manifestation suggesting the presence of unique underlying genetic variants in european genomes that maybe correlated with their variable susceptibility and immune responsiveness the covid-19 infection has so far shown an interesting pattern in central and south america while in countries like ecuador and brazil the death to recovery ratio is  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

ma1 is genetically proximal to all modern-day native americans 14-38 native american ancestry and has been found to be basal to modern-day west eurasians without any close affinity to east asians 21  ma-1 mitochondrial genome was determined to be associated with haplogroup u which is found at high frequency among mesolithic european huntergatherers whgs 21  depicting a connection between the whg and modern-day south american genomes in our analyses americans could be best modelled as a combination of two source populations namely ma1 and eskimos we used a mixture of seven ancient and modern-day populations comprising of chg whg swedenhgmotala papuan chukchi karitiana and mbuti as our right outgroup populations o7 interestingly our results indicated that countries such as mexico and peru with lower death to recovery ratio have higher eskimo ancestry fraction 132 and 203 and lower ma1 fraction 868 and 797 compared to our other study populations further we found  zero eskimo ancestry fraction among columbians and purto ricans where death to recovery ratio is relatively high the high death to recovery ratio in brazil 35 is reminiscent of similarly high ratios in portugal 39 and may be attributed to the predominant portuguese ancestry in the former as noted above significant variation in afs of ace2 gene the presumed receptor of novel coronavirus has been reported among people from east asian and european ancestry 5  the authors of this study speculated that the differences in afs of ace2 coding variants are associated with variable expression of ace2 in tissues additionally they reported that most eqtl variants identified by them had discernibly higher afs among east asian populations compared to europeans which may result in differential susceptibility towards the novel coronavirus in these two populations under similar conditions consistent with these findings we identified 404 snps that are associated with host immune response such

incoming southeast asians took place 2000-3800 years ago giving rise to the aaa ancestry notably the south asian populations with whom the incoming southeast asians mingled were aasi related with little to no west eurasian ancestry fraction 27  finally it has been showed that the tibeto-burmans atbs derived their ancestry through admixture with low-altitude east asians who migrated from china and likely across northern india or myanmar 28 leading to the high genomic proximity between south asians of atb ancestry and east asians the genomic proximity between east asians and south asians mostly from northeast india with prominent atb ancestry is likely reflected through fewer numbers of covid-19 cases from this region so far one case each in arunachal pradesh and mizoram and two in manipur notably the death to recovery ratio in the largely atb dominated region of ladakh india is zero indicating complete recovery so far of covid-19 infected individuals from this region while the same in its neighboring state of jammu and kashmir with predominant ani ancestral fractions is discernibly higher 05 further indian states with large number of indigenous tribal population with prevalence of aaa ancestry andor with large fractions of aasi-related ancestry eg chhattisgarh jharkhand and orissa have not registered any covid related deaths till date indicating that south asians with dominant aaa and aasi related ancestry may also likely be less severely affected against the most detrimental effects of covid-19 infection nevertheless the severity of covid-19 manifestation is likely to vary appreciably across the south asian populations approximately 12 people of ani and asi ancestries belong to mitochondrial haplogroup u which as described above is found at high frequency

driven approach to expand and substantiate our current knowledge as well as facilitate the development of population specific therapeutics to mitigate this worldwide challenge  applicability of time fractional derivative models for simulating the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of covid-19 yong zhang xiangnan yu hongguang sun geoffrey tick r wei wei bin jin   fractional calculus can provide a promising tool in modeling biological phenomena as reviewed recently by lonescu et al 1 for example fractional-derivative equation fde models have been applied to capture complex dynamics in biological tissues 2 tumor growth 3 dna sequencing 4 drug uptake 5 and salmonella bacterial infection in animal herds 6 most recently the fde models have been applied to model the pine wilt disease 7 the human respiratory syncytial virus hrsv disease 8 the harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass 9 human liver using caputo-fabrizio fractional derivative 10 11 and tumor-immune surveillance 12 motivated by these successful applications this study tests whether the fdes can be applied to model the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of coronavirus an emerging and critical research area that has not been focused by the fractional calculus community before the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak a respiratory illness that started first detected in late december 2019 is a pandemic infecting 336000 people in more than 140 countries with the average fatality rate of 44 globally data up to 3222020 13 the covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating almost every aspect of life damaging global economy and altering both man-made and natural environments urgent actions have been taken but further effective and efficient strategies are promptly needed to confront this global challenge to address this challenge and promptly guide the next efforts it is critical to model the covid-19 outbreak mathematical models are among the necessary tools to quantify the covid-19 and therefore testing the applicability of such fde models under this new global pandemic is the primary objective motivating this study this study aims to model the covid-19 evolution dynamics ie transmission infection recovery and death evolution for representative countries with apparent coronavirus cases including china the united states us italy japan and south korea using mathematical models most specifically the fde models described previously it should be noted that the covid-19 spread in these countries experienced different starting initiation and detection times an important fact to consider when applying these models for example china had passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak finally reaching a milestone with no new local infections on 3192020 79 days from the onset 12312019 in wuhan china while the us coronavirus cases soared past 10000 on the same day this study will apply the core characteristics of the covid-19 outbreak obtained in china to estimate the covd-19 spread in the us as well as other countries where the number of affected people has not yet reached its number of peak cases in addition this new pandemic may last for a relatively longer time than expected 14 no vaccine against sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is currently available 15 indeed a vaccine for prevention and infection control may not be ready before march 2021 for the covid-19 considering a minimum of 45 weeks for trials and at least 1 year for safety evaluation and final deployment efficient strategies are therefore needed to mitigate the covid-19 outbreak possible non-pharmaceutical scenarios such as isolation of cases and contact tracing can be evaluated using mathematical models 16 in order to identify the most efficient mitigation strategies going forward this is another major motivation and the secondary task of this study using the fde models to address the questions mentioned above this study is organized as follows section 2 proposes an updated seir model with an fde-based component for covid-19 where s e i and r stand for susceptible exposed infectious and recovered people respectively 17 this model is then applied to fit and predict the covid-19 spread in various provinces and major cities in china resulting in abundant datasets to derive the core characteristics of the covid-19 dynamics in evolution section 3 predicts the spread of covid-19 in the other countries using the knowledge that is gained from the china case study section 4 proposes a fully lagrangian approach with the time fde to model the spatiotemporal evolution of covid-19 and then applies it to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate the virus spread section 5 reports the main conclusions specifically the feasibility of fdes for capturing covid-19 evolution in the appendix the impacts of the non-singular kernel and fractional derivative type on model results are further discussed for readers particularly interested in these fractional calculus techniques the main contributions of this work therefore include 1 the first application of fdes in modeling the evolution of the covid-19 death toll 2 an updated seir model with a transient recovery rate to better capture the dynamics of covid-19 pandemic within china and for other countries and 3 a particle-tracking approach based on stochastic bimolecular reaction theory to evaluate the mitigation of the spread of the covid-19 outbreak the classical seir model containing four populations s e i and r takes the form 291adsdtrpisn

2 is the rate for the healthy susceptible person to be transferred to an infected one from exposed persons note that covid-19 patients in the incubation period might be contagious too and r
2 is the number of healthy susceptible people that are contacted by exposed people daily now the infection rates can change with time and the infected persons are removed from the risk of infection via a time-dependent rate term of t if the recovered individuals can return to a susceptible status due to for example a loss of immunity then the partial differential equation pde 2d for the time rate of change of r requires one more sink term r where  is the rate of the recovered individuals returning to a susceptible status we replace the integer-order derivatives in the classical seir 1 by the fractional-order derivatives in 2 to capture the possible nonlocal impact such as the memory impact or any apparent delay in the covid-19 outbreak herein we use the death evolution 2e as an example hence the fde 2e containing the death probability of  while the other patients are cured is modified asdddt110tdtd which is the caputo fractional derivative 30 31 with order  0     1 note that all the other indexes

3 and 
4 in model 2 are in the same range of 0 1 the caputo fractional derivate was selected here because the initial condition for caputo derivative takes the same form as that for the integer-order pde particularly the caputo derivative allows the utilization of initial values of the integer order with known physical interpretations when the order 1 model 2e reduces to the classical integer-order pde for the death evolution the fractional pde 2e is used here for two reasons first the evolution of deaths and cures may be characterized by a random process due to the fact that the exact time for the recovered person to be initially infected is unknown ie the patient that died or was cured today may have been diagnosed yesterday or last week second some patients may not be treated in time after being infected making the death toll evolve with a time memory therefore we extend the classical mass-balance equation of death cases using the fde to characterize the random property and memory impact embedded in the temporal evolution of mortality the fractional pde 2e and its classical version will be compared below using real observed data other complex seir models were also applied to model covid-19 spread such as the one proposed by tang et al 32 which has 12 ratesprobabilities and 8 groups of people in seir numerical results show that compared with the seir model 2 the complex model proposed by tang et al 32 with solutions shown by the dotted lines in fig 1
a accurately fits the observed data at the early stage but then overpredicts the spread of covid-19 observed after 2122020 the dynamics of transmission for covid-19 especially the recovery rate therefore changed over time in china likely due to the time-dependent conditions ie improvementsadjustments in medical care as mentioned above a dynamic time-local seir model therefore may be preferred for modeling covid-19 spread in china in addition compared to the fde 2e the best-fit solution using the classical pde dddti for death evolution see the black dotted line in fig 1
a slightly overestimates the late-time growth of mortality the actual death toll in hubei province grew slower than that estimated by a constant rate model indicating that the memory impact may affect the late-time dynamics of death and can be better captured by the fde 2e the best-fit solutions using model 2 fit the evolution of the infected and recovered populations well for the data recorded from hubei province and three large cities closely related such as in transportation or economic cooperation to wuhan china fig 1 the model was also shown to predict well the observed time series of covid-19 spread from 382020 to 3222020 for most places except for shanghai city fig 1
d this is likely due to the number of overseas covid-19 cases imported into shanghai whereby the number of cases were observed to increase rapidly after 332020 causing inconsistency in the affected population and failure of the model shanghai pudong international airport one of the two airports located in shanghai city is the eighth-busiest airport in the world and the busiest international gateway of mainland china when excluding the coronavirus cases imported from overseas model 2 predicts the covid-19 spread evolution data in shanghai fig 2
 therefore model 2 works well for various places in china that may not be experience a significant influx of imported cases as external sources can easily break the internal evolution especially the asymptotic status of covid-19 in china the resultant time-dependent recovery rate t is depicted in fig 3
 where the rate fitted by the latest observation data point within the fitting period ie 372020 remains stable in the following prediction period the best-fit recovery rate is the highest for shanghai except for the impulse of t for wenzhou as discussed below which is expected since shanghai has the best public health system of all of these cities contrarily hubei shows the lowest recovery rate likely due to its delayed response and the relatively limited public health capability at the beginning of the outbreak compared with shanghai wenzhou exhibits an impulse in the infection and recovery dynamics of coronavirus fig 1
b different from that observed for the other places studied herein on february 27 2020 the number of wenzhous infected people suddenly declined combined with the sudden increase of the number of people cured this abrupt change can be effectively captured by the seir model 2 with an impulse in the recovery rate t this recovery impulse is most likely due to a new hospital the no 2 affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university recently built in this city in early february which significantly improved the public health system the first discharged cases of coronavirus from this hospital appeared in late february 2020 resulting in the sudden increase in the total recovery rate in addition a relatively large number of people working in wuhan returned to wenzhou in late january and it appears that the improved efficient screening process successfully identified the number of infected cases the new cases were 29000 from 1242020 to 1312020 in wenzhou with an average of 3600 new patients per day who were then immediately centralized for treatment it appears that this fast response helped to alleviate the spread of coronavirus in wenzhou the best-fit parameters of model 2 are listed in table 1
 and the initial values for each group of people are listed in table 2
 we reveal three behaviors in model parameters first the best-fit s-shaped recovery rate t fig 3 can be described by the sigmoid function ta1ebtc where a b and c are factors showing that the recovery rate increases exponentially before reaching a stable condition this increase is likely due to the fact that healthcare facility capabilities improved with time with an accelerating rate before reaching their asymptote or maximum capacity second the rates and probabilities r r
2 p and p
2 affecting the covid-19 transmissioninfection evolution slightly change in space and remain stable for a given site table 1 the small spatial fluctuation of these rates may be due to the similar strategies implemented by local governments for intervening and mitigating covid-19 spread ie full lockdowns across the country the time-invariant transmissioninfection rates for a given site indicate that the spreading rate of covid-19 may not significantly change over a short period of time for a given area with consistent intervening policies enacted third the model predictions show that it may take 47 14 25 and 11 days from 3142020 for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population for hubei province and the cities of wenzhou shenzhen and shanghai respectively notably since the best-fit t increases in time the prediction using a constant  may overestimate the long-term future infection cases and underestimate the future recovery trend for covid-19 we also introduce an index c to quantify the infection severity of covid-19 at different places3cnimax where imax is the maximum number of cumulative infected people at the given site a smaller c represents a greater infection severity of coronavirus there is a power-law relationship between the regional population n and the maximum cumulated number of infected people imax fig 4
 this empirical formula may be used to approximate the largest cumulative number of infections which will be applied in the subsequent section for predicting the covid-19 evolution outside of china where the coronavirus infection has not yet reached its peak number of cases to decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread the uss main propagated mode up to 3222020 has been the use of social distancing actions the predicted covid-19 spread in the us is plotted in fig 5
 there is a high uncertainty in the prediction of covid-19 evolution within the us considering the recent dramatic fluctuations in the number of infected people and the delayed screening during the beginning stages of the outbreak thus we must make assumptions and can only estimate the future coronavirus evolution in the us under specific scenarios based on the index of infection severity c in the representative areas of china we predict the us covid-19 evolution dynamics under two scenarios as shown in fig 5 
fig 5
a shows the possible spread of covid-19 in california us assuming that the coronavirus dynamics including the infectionrecovery rates and the infection severity are similar to those observed in hubei china the solid lines representing an optimistic scenario or can change quite differently the dashed lines representing a longer-term severe scenario the estimated total population of infection in california varies from 50000 to 200000 with the peak number of cases occurring around 20 to 50 days from 3222020

b shows the possible spread of covid-19 in the us solid lines represent model solutions assuming that covid-19 spreads similarly to that as observed in hubei china while the dashed lines are model solutions that assume covid-19 spreads differently the results show that the estimated total infected population varies from 700000 to 3000000 with the peak number of cases occurring 2050 days and the covid-19 outbreak lasting for 50 days from 3222020 respectively to decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread italys mode is now similar to china lockdown of the full population the predicted covid-19 spread in italy is plotted in fig 6
a although italy has followed chinas mode of national isolation the number of infected people increased rapidly from 3142020 to 3192020 495 new cases per day to account for the delayed national quarantine compared with china we decrease the c index while also increasing the upper limit of the cumulative infection the covid-19 evolution prediction results show that there may be a turning point in the next two weeks when the current infected cases begin to decline we also separate the death toll from the number of recovered cases south koreas mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is through fast detection and tracking of the disease south korea is using efficient mobile diagnoses tests and accurate tracing of infected cases to maintain a low death rate even with a large infected population the mobile method can test 20000 people per day the maximum capability on 3122020 and apps for cell phones andor credit cards can accurately track the routes of infected people with the help of local government without an invasion of privacy so that warnings can be immediately delivered to the general population to obviate the places with high risk the current infected population may have passed its peak number of cases around 3202020 and the prediction shows that the covid-19 outbreak may be well controlled in 35 days from 3222020 fig 6
b japans mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is compatible with that of the us in addition to other changes such as enhanced educationoutreach and rapid treatment of the infected cases specific policies include social distancing which might be a key barrier to the spread of the novel coronavirus personal hygiene and quarantine of the infected cases the current data and modeling results fig 6
c show that japan has an efficient way so far to limit the maximum population infected and slow the spread of covid-19 while this outbreak may last for a while the random walk based stochastic model for covid-19 spread is analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction-based mechanismcondition 35 when a reactant a particle representing a susceptible individual a meets a reactant b particle representing an infectious person b a chemical reaction may occur if the collision energy is large enough to break the chemical bond meaning that the susceptible person a may be infected if satisfying additional criteria such as a and b are close enough and b touches hisher face after receiving coronavirus from a therefore the condition of a being infected is not deterministic but rather a random probability-controlled process this probability is related to various factors such as the duration that a and b are in contact the infectivity rate and the distance between the two people which may be characterized parsimoniously by the interaction radius r that controls the number of reactant pairs susceptible  infectious in a potential reaction infection 35 hence the core of the random walk stochastic model to simulate covid-19 spread is to define the interaction radius r the analogous development and similarities between bimolecular reactions and the sir model can also be seen from their governing equations the time-dependent sir model takes the form 364adstdttstitn

5cdcxtdtkftatbt where a b and c denote the concentrations of a b and c respectively and kft is the forward kinetic coefficient of reaction equations 5a and 5b are functionally similar to equations 4a and 4b respectively if the recovery rate t0 therefore following the argument in zhang et al 35 and lu et al 37 we derive analytically the interaction radius r for the sir model 46rt12tnmavttt12 where v denotes the volume of the domain t is the time step in random walk particle tracking maa0vna0 is the mass or weight carried by each a particle a

scenario 1 no special constraints assuming a city with 10000 people and 4 initial coronavirus cases this scenario does not put any constraints for any population we assume that the population distributes in the city randomly at the beginning and then moves randomly the spread of covid-19 is then simulated using the stochastic model proposed in section 41 
scenario 2 social distancing this scenario assumes that all people in the city maintain a social distance significantly decreasing the probability of infection 
scenario 3 attempted quarantine this scenario creates a forced quarantine for infected individuals before the outbreak which is expected to be the most efficient way of quarantine in the stochastic model we assume that 10 days after being infected the person will be removed because of being cured or expired dead this is because the median disease incubation period has been estimated to be 51 days 39 for simplicity purposes the interaction radius r 6 remains constant since the constant interaction radius was found to be able to efficiently capture the temporal variation of effective reaction rates in mixing controlled reaction experiments or simulations 35 37 the initial number of a and b particles is 10000 and 4 respectively the lagrangian solutions of the covid-19 outbreak for the three scenarios are depicted in fig 7
 modeling results for scenarios 1 2 and 3 show a peak in the curve of newly infected people at time t28 65 and 32 respectively demonstrating that the virus spreads the fastest for the scenario without mitigation constraints ie scenario 1 where the number of the total infected people or cases increases by one order of magnitude every 10 days in the rising limb as expected however the value for this peak scenario 1 198 people is lower than that for scenario 3 267 people although the total number of the infected people for scenario 1 9336 is slightly larger than scenario 3 9322 this may be due to a greater separation of infection cases for the higher number of initial coronavirus carriers in scenario 1 which causes a lower and relatively flatter covid-19 evolution peak compared to that of scenario 3 scenario 2 has the lowest peak value 121 people and the most-delayed peak in the curve for new cases and the total infection time is almost doubled compared to the other two scenarios indicating that people living with strict social distancing may also suffer from a much longer period of covid-19 threat it is also noteworthy that the overall trend of the solution simulation of scenario 1 initial surge without special constraints fig 7
a is similar to that for italy which had a delayed response to the covid-19 outbreak initially fig 6
a and scenario 3 solution a lower peak value and a longer duration due to social distancing fig 7
b is similar to that observed in japan where social distancing actions have been implemented fig 6
c the simulated particle plumes plotted in fig 8
reveal the subtle discrepancy between the three mitigation scenarios scenario 1 assumes that four initial cases were initially located on the right side of the city while the whole population 10000 susceptible persons was distributed randomly in the 1  1 domain fig 8
a the trajectory of each person is assumed to follow two-dimensional brownian motion with retention described by eq 7 to capture the random vector for each displacement and the random waiting time between two consecutive motions described by the time fractional derivative term in eq 7 the virus moved quickly from east to west figs 8
b and 8
c spreading over the entire city before all the infected people were cured or expired dead at time t69 fig 8
d a total of 664 susceptible people 66 of the total population distributed randomly around the city were never infected 
scenario 2 assumes that social distancing can reduce the infection probability which can be characterized by a smaller reaction rate or a smaller interaction radius in our lagrangian approach the virus was spreading at a much lower rate from west to east than that in scenario 1 figs 8
e8g reaching a stable condition ie  of cases neither increasing or decreasing at a later time t125 and leaving more susceptible people unaffected 2734 total which is 273 of the population therefore social distancing is effective in limiting the spread of coronavirus among people note however this scenario assumes that every person in this city strictly maintains social distancing otherwise a surge of infections may occur the same way as that shown in scenario 1 
scenario 3 assumes self-quarantine notably not all of the infected people can be effectively quarantined due to the following 1 people can be infected without coronavirus symptoms 2 people in the incubation period can transmit the infection and 3 limited health care facilities and capabilities for the large influx of patients for example according to imai et al 40 many infected people could not be appropriately screened initially in wuhan city china under this condition we assume that 50 of people infected and diagnosed are immediately quarantined while the remaining infected people fig 8
i can still cause the spread of coronavirus figs 8
j8l self-quarantine therefore may not be as effective as maintained social distancing fractional calculus provides a useful tool to modeling complex dynamics in biology and this study extended the fde for modeling the coronavirus outbreak the covid-19 is a pandemic radically impacting our lives by altering our daily patterns and interactions in an unprecedented way and rate a time-dependent seir model with built-in fde components motivated by the coronavirus milestone of recording zero new local infections in china on 3192020 was applied to capture the covid-19 evolution observed over the last three months in china a stochastic model built upon the time fde for random resting times of people was also proposed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical mitigation options three main conclusions are presented by this study first different properties in the covid-19 spreading in china data up to 3222020 exhibited different kinetics and the death evolution can be captured by the time fde model fitting showed that the recovery rate of covid-19 increases with time due to various human factors the fast-increasing recovery rate caused the rapid decline of the current infected population curve removing the possible memory impact and any delayed processes which does not require a time-nonlocal model such as the time fde contrarily the evolution of deaths in china italy south korea and japan can be captured well by the time fde likely due to the time memory in the death toll it is also noteworthy that the time fde version of the seir model might be needed if the late-time recovery rate declines due to the change of coronavirus properties affected by the change of climate public policy andor possible evolution of the virus itself and the contiguous mannerrate second the updated seir model provided predictions although with high uncertainty for covid-19 evolution within china and for other countries for example the improved seir model showed that if the infection and recovery rates remain stable the number of cumulative infections is likely to decline to 1 of the total infected population within one month from 3222020 in china the overseas imported cases however may break the internal asymptotic status and significantly postpone the ending time of covid-19 in china predictions using the validated seir model also showed different evolution dynamics of covid-19 within populations of the united states italy japan and south korea for example it may take at least 23 months for the current infected population to drop below 1 of the cumulative infected population in the us requiring more efficient mitigation strategies while south korea may control the covid-19 spread in a relatively shorter period however these predictions contain high uncertainty due to uncertainty in the maximum infected population and changes of transmissioninfection and recovery rates among different countries third a stochastic model based on the lagrangian scheme for the time fdes analogous to a mixing-limited reaction mechanism model showed that self-quarantine may not be as effective as strict social distancing since not all the infected people can be diagnosed and immediately quarantined while strict social distancing can apparently slow covid-19 spread the pandemic may last longer this is another case that fractional calculus may be used to explore covid-19 outbreak therefore one of the main contributions of this study is to extend the application of fdes to model dynamics and mitigation scenarios of the coronavirus spread yong zhang conceptualization methodology software writing-original draft preparation writing-reviewing and editing management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution xiangnan yu software methodology data curation visualization sun hongguang supervision geoffrey r tick formal analysis data curation wei wei resources bin jin supervision funding acquisition the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  coronavirus in water environments occurrence persistence and concentration methods -

 the present review summarizes the current state of knowledge on coronaviruses of interest for human health in water environments with an emphasis on their occurrence and persistence and on concentration methods for their detection in different water matrices the reported outcomes are aimed to improve knowledge on transmission pathways and possible infection hazards related to poor drinking water and sanitation management additionally research gaps on methodologies for detection with focus on concentration methods enveloped viruses are specifically examined to strengthen their monitoring in water media an electronic search of available literature was run on 23 february 2020 search was conducted using the electronic databases pubmed embase and web science core collection with no restriction for publication date or language the search strategy included terms related to the virus group and the environmental matrices of interest see table 1 a total of 4382 articles were retrieved by the search and duplicates n  776 were automatically removed using the endnote reference manager software online using the rayyan review platform httpsrayyanqcriorgwelcome titles and abstracts of the retained 3606 articles were screened and assessed for eligibility by two independent reviewers glr and es and the disagreements were resolved by discussion between the reviewers and a third referee lb based on the objective of the study 3543 records were eliminated as not relevant full text screening was undertaken on the retained 63 articles and further 51 articles were excluded as either i unrelated to cov in water environments ii records duplicating results retrieved by earlier articles linked articles iii articles related only to inactivation of surrogate viruses other than cov iv reviews not including data relevant to the study v non-relevant erratum for one of the 63 retained records full text was not available for screening but the article was assessed as relevant based on abstract content finally 12 articles were included in the study corresponding to original studies whose main findings are presented in table 2 table 3 table 4

gundy et al 2019 investigated the survival of a human coronavirus hcov-229e and of an animal coronavirus fipv feline infectious peritonitis virus in tap water filtered and non-filtered and wastewater primary and activated sludge effluents comparing results with those of poliovirus-1 pv-1 sabin attenuated strain lsc-2ab in wastewater the tested cov died off quite rapidly with a t999 of 277354 days at 23 c significantly the pv-1 lasted 2 to 3 times longer than cov did requiring 109 days for a comparable reduction in primary wastewater and 57 days in secondary effluents in tap water cov reduction was slower than in wastewaters at 23 c the t999 was 121125 days for hcov-229e and fipv while at 4 c the same reduction was predicted by modelling to be achivable over 100 days these yields highlight once again that virus survival decreases with increasing temperature similarly to the results obtained on wastewater pv-1 survived six times longer than cov in both filtered and unfiltered tap water confirming the observation that non-enveloped viruses display higher resistance in water enviroments compared to enveloped viruses another important finding of the study was that cov inactivation was faster in filtered tap water than unfiltered tap water suggesting that suspended solids in water can provide protection for viruses adsorbed to these particles finally a more recent study ye et al 2016 investigated the survival and partitioning of two enveloped viruses mhv and pseudomonas phage 6 and of two non-enveloped viruses bacteriophages ms2 and t3 in untreated municipal wastewater unpasteurized and pasteurized wastewater were spiked with the viral stocks and were then incubated at 25 c or 10 c to mimic typical summer and winter wastewater temperatures inactivation proceeded faster for the enveloped viruses in unpasteurized wastewaters at 25 c the time to reach a 90 reduction t90 was 13 h for mhv and 7 h phage 6 compared to a predicted value of 121 h for the non-enveloped phage ms2 at 10 c the inactivation kinetics of both mhv and 6 were once again significantly slower than at environmental temperatures with a t90 of 2836 h in pasteurized wastewater both mhv and phage 6 lost infectivity at a significantly slower rate compared to unpasteurized wastewater t90 of 19 h for mhv and 53 h for phage 6 at 25 c possibly due to the reduction of bacterial extracellular enzyme activity and the absence of protozoan and metazoan predation in pasteurized samples indeed it was demonstrated that the presence of an indigenous microbial population has a negative impact on virus survival pinon and vialette 2018 rzezutka and cook 2004 finally in the same study ye et al reported that up to 26 of the enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater that means that a reduction of enveloped viruses in wastewaters is provided by solid settling two reports specifically addressing detection in water environments of cov of interest for human health and three metagenomicvirome studies were retrieved through literature search table 3 sewage discharges from two hospitals in beijing china hosting sars patients during the 2003 outbreak were analyzed with the aim to investigate whether sewage may be a possible route of transmission for sars-cov wang et al 2005b both cell culture and rt-pcr were utilized to ascertain viability and detect the virus in sewage while viral genome was repeatedly detected in hospital sewage before disinfection 1010 wastewater samples and in some cases after disinfection 310 samples infectious sars-cov was never detected in the tested samples possible explanation of authors includes viral inactivation by disinfectants high concentration of disinfectants were used after a patient had bowel movements low viral concentration or loss of infectivity by unknown factors during the concentration process in the second study specifically addressing cov detection in water blanco et al 2019 investigated the occurrence of these viruses in surface waters of wadi hanifa riyadh using a broad-range rt-pcr for the detection of alpha- and betacoronavirus of the 21 tested samples only one sample was positive for cov upon sequence analysis the positive sample was found to be closely related to a novel rodentshrew-specific clade within lineage a of alphacoronavirus reported in asia and europe three metagenomic studies have detected cov in water matrices two focused on class b biosolids from wastewater treatment facility bibby et al 2011 bibby peccia 2013 and one on different type of water river lake reservoir alexyuk et al 2017 the study of bibby and coworkers identified a large variety of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses in biosolids including coronavirus herpesvirus torque teno virus and parechovirus interestingly all these groups of viruses were highly represented in compared to adenovirus which have been for long time considered the most abundant viral genus in biosolids bibby et al 2011 in detail 10 cov sequences were identified nine of which related to hcov-229e and one to hcov-hku1 two years later another paper from the same authors described the diversity of viruses in sewage sludge samples influents and effluents with comparable results emerging viruses such as coronavirus klassevirus and cosavirus were detected in abundance in the sample bibby peccia 2013 coronaviruses were detected in 83 of samples and coronavirus hku1 was the second most prevalent rna virus interestingly coronavirus showed a higher relative abundance in influent samples compared to effluent ones finally alexyuk et al 2017 studied the viromes sampled in surface water river lake and water reservoir while the majority of the sequences were related to autochthonous viruses typical for aquatic ecosystems allochthonous viruses such families as coronaviridae reoviridae and herpesviridae were also detected suggesting anthropogenic pollution of the three selected water environments in detail coronaviridae were detected in all of the three environments ranging from 0002 to 0009 of the total sequences depending on sample to complete the picture on the occurrence of coronavirus in water environments after the initial submission of this scoping review while the paper was under review novel papers some of which published as preprint have demonstrated the occurrence of sars-cov-2 in municipal wastewaters worldwide and specifically in the netherlands medema et al 2020 in massachusetts wu et al 2020 in australia ahmed et al 2020 france wurtzer et al 2020 and italy la rosa et al 2020 submitted five studies table 4 investigated concentration methods for cov in waters and the associated recovery efficiency the first study investigating cov recovery from waters was published more than 30 years ago collomb et al 1986 using for the spiking experiments a bovine enteric coronavirus and assessing a concentration procedure based on viral adsorption on glass-powder at acid ph followed by alkaline-ph elution since cov is sensitive to acid ph 3 and alkaline ph ph  10 adsorption was optimal at ph 33 and elution at ph 9 under such conditions the overall efficiency of the concentration method appeared to be between 24 and 28 unfortunately since it was not possible to retrieve the full text of this publication no further information beside those included in the abstract could be reported following the sars outbreak of 2003 wang et al 2005c performed a study to evaluate the recovery from spiked sewage of sars-cov and of a surrogate virus bacteriophage f2 the concentration procedure foresaw the use of positively charged electropositive filter media particle silica gel plus aloh3 packed in a glass column according to a protocol previously described by li et al 1998 for enteric viruses hospital sewage and domestic sewage 100 ml were spiked with sars-cov and phage f2 passed through the glass column eluted from the filter media with 3  nutrient broth ph 72 and then polyethylene glycol peg precipitated the procedure gave recoveries of sars-cov ranging from 0 sewage from a housing estate to 214 sewage from the hospital with an average of 102the recovery of phage f2 under the same conditions were significantly higher from 336 to more than 100 this method therefore seemed more suitable for the concentration of enveloped viruses in agreement with the

ye et al 2016 evaluated three methods for separating and concentrating viruses from the liquid fraction of municipal wastewater i peg precipitation ii ultracentrifugation iii ultrafiltration with centrifugal devices ye et al 2016 wastewater 250 ml for peg precipitation and ultrafiltration and 60 ml for ultracentrifugation was spiked with the rodent coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv and with the non-enveloped phage ms2 low mean recoveries 5 were achieved for both mhv and ms2 with the ultracentrifugation method this result was suggested to be related to virus inactivation by the high g-force of the ultracentrifugation recovery of mhv was low 5 also with the peg precipitation method whose performance for ms2 concentration was instead significantly higher 431 finally the optimized ultrafiltration protocol adopted in the study provided the highest recoveries for both viruses 251 for mhv and 556 for phage ms2 results of ye and colleagues suggested that the peg precipitation method which is effective at recovering non-enveloped viruses from water samples may be not optimal for recovering infective enveloped viruses while ultrafiltration could be successfully applied for recovering cov however in this study only small volumes of wastewater were tested using centrifugal ultrafilters since viruses in water matrices may occur in very low numbers there is a need for analytical methods suitable to process large volumes of water it was therefore concluded by the authors that further progress could be made through the optimization of hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow ultrafiltration to allow concentration of cov in waters from larger volumes of water 
abd-elmaksoud and coworkers 2014 measured the effectiveness of glass wool filtration to simultaneously concentrate a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in runoff from agricultural fields using dairy manure as fertilizer viruses of bovine origin were used to spike 20 l of dechlorinated tap water including bovine coronavirus bocov bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 bvdv1 and bvdv2 bovine rotavirus group a borv and poliovirus 3 sabin moreover e coli o157nm and campylobacter jejuni were selected as bacterial pathogen three water turbidity levels were evaluated prepared by mixing dried agricultural soil into the 20 l of water after glass wool filtration elution was performed with 3 beef extract-glycine buffer ph 95 followed by flocculation with peg 8000 recovered organisms were enumerated by qpcr results showed that glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for the concentration of several waterborne pathogens simultaneously in details the average recoveries across the different turbidity levels tested were 181 for bocov 221 for borv 156 and 197 for bvdv1 and bvdv2 respectively higher recovery efficiencies were obtained for the non-enveloped virus poliovirus 3 579 and for the bacterial microorganisms e coli o157nm 548 and c jejuni 327 however the authors advised to use caution in the interpretation of these comparative results since the quantity of pathogens used for spiking varied for the different microorganisms precluding a clear differentiation of the effects on recovery efficiency of seeding quantities and pathogen type 
blanco et al 2019 used adsorption to glass wool followed by elution with alkaline buffer and subsequent secondary concentration through peg 6000 precipitation the viruses used for the experimental procedures were hepatitis a virus hav non-enveloped and the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev large volumes of water 5 l and 50 l were used for method optimization and performance characterization several steps of the elution procedure were modified compared to other published glass wool protocols to improve the recovery of tgev and virus recoveries were ascertained by real-time qpcr recovery of the initial experiments 5 l of water adsorption to the positively charged glass wool matrix elution with glycinebeef extract buffer at ph 95 with 10 min of contact showed that tgev efficiently adsorbed onto the glass wool attachment of 571 but it was poorly eluted from it with an overall recovery of 26 the increase of buffer ph to 110 provided an improvement of elution efficiency and a final recovery of 288 further performance improvements could be obtained by changing the length of the elution incubation subsequent experiments for the concentration of hav and tgev from 50 l of spiked water samples were therefore all performed using an elution buffer ph 110 results showed that addition of tween 80 hampered the recovery of tgev possibly by damaging the lipid-containing envelope of viruses recirculation of the eluent at ph 110 for 20 min was instead beneficial to the elution and provided recoveries of 180 and 239 for tgev and hav respectively similarly increasing peg concentration from 10 to 20 in the secondary concentration showed a significant improvement of the recovery 513 and 472 for tgev and hav respectively following optimization of the method the procedure provided a recovery efficiency of 51 for tgev and 45 for hav in spiked surface water overall the study by blanco et al 2019 clearly demonstrated that the concentration procedures commonly used for non-enveloped viruses need adaptation to yield satisfactory performances on enveloped viruses like cov to summarize this scoping review has highlighted several aspects of coronavirus research that need to be explored in depth1the evidence of the presence of cov in waters is currently very scarce and there is no evidence that human cov are present in surface or groundwater sources or transmitted through contaminated drinking-water2environmental factors such as temperature seem to affect the ability of cov to persist in water further studies are needed to investigate cov persistence in water in relation to climatic and seasonal conditions3although different studies showed different viral inactivation rates for cov in water based on the type of virus and the type of water generally there is evidence that cov is generally considered unstable in the environment and is more susceptible to oxidants such as chlorine than non-enveloped viruses4based on the few available data methods commonly used to concentrate and recover non-enveloped enteric viruses from wastewater and other water matrices may not be appropriate to recover cov therefore future research should focus on the development of robust methods for concentrating cov and other enveloped viruses from large volumes of waters and from different types of water

organization who reported the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 known as covid-19 in late december 2019 in china as of april 5 2020 based on the who report ie httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports the numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and mortalities were 1133758 and 62784 respectively moreover the sequence similarity scores of covid-19 with bat sars-like sars-cov and mers-cov were about 99 96 and 50 respectively 1 epidemiologically the covid-19 outbreak has spread to more than 200 countries resulting in who risk assessment status as very high for this purpose several authors have recently carried out their researches on covid-19 which were mostly based on clinical and epidemiological views and included the potential symptoms the ways of covid-19 transmission and epidemic issues 2 among them hellewell et al proposed a stochastic transmission model that resulted in the case and contact isolations to control the covid-19 outbreak 3 moreover peeri et al compared the epidemics of three types of coronaviruses namely sars mers and covid-19 they concluded that there were no frequent outbreaks found from two previous ones and the challenges for the covid-19 should be covered by the applications of the internet of things iot which will be beneficial for control the incidence among people 4 two systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies were available in the literature they proposed five useful factors ie clinical laboratory imaging features procalcitonin measurements outcomes of confirmed cases in predicting the severity of the covid-19 disease 5 6 7 in the current study the comparisons between incidence and mortality as well as recovery and death rates among the countries for covid-19 and sars-cov with the higher incidence rates were performed using the meta-analysis approach developed in the meta-mums tool the statistical analyses used both subgroup forest plots using event rate and risk ratio statistics data for meta-analysis could be extracted from open datasets 8 the original and well-known data resources for covid-19 were world health organization who ie httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports and worldometers ie httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus the retrieved parameters for the countries to be meta-analyzed were total sample size cumulative confirmed cases cumulative mortalities and total recovered cases and the data for high-risk countries in terms of incidence related to covid-19 was extracted up to april 5 2020 moreover the summary table of sars-cov was available from httpswwwwhointcsrsarscountrycountry20030815pdfuaequals1 for the period november 16 2002august 7 2003 the analysis environment was the meta-mums tool as a comprehensive meta-analysis tool without any limitations in number size and data entry 910 analysis of dichotomous data was done with a 95 confidence interval to set lower and upper limits based on risk ratio rr as well as event rate er when no interventions are involved 11 in all calculations and analyses the p-values less than 005 were statistically significant the evaluation of heterogeneity between the analyzed countries was by calculating the i2 test and cochranes q test and whenever a significant heterogeneity was present a random-effects model was used otherwise we utilize a fixed-effects model additionally subgroup analysis was carried out among the target countries to compare the effect sizes of incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality using risk ratio and subgroup analysis was performed for comparing effect sizes of incidence mortality and recovery rates using event rate in the current meta-analysis n  1124243 patients of covid-19 infection and n  8346 of sars-cov were available and retrieved from the initial research of who and worldometer freely accessible databases the incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality ratios are also determined indeed subgroup analyses were also performed for evaluation of learning significant differences of er and rr event rates of incidence recovery and mortality of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as the following the incidence event rates of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below and the forest plots are illustrated in figure 1

logit er  12303 ll  13910 ul  10695 p 0001
 so the incidence rate of covid-19 is more than sars-cov p 0001 and the same outcomes apply to the cumulative incidence rates with p 0001 the mortality event rates of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as follows where the forest plots figure 1b shows the relationships between two viral diseaseslogit er  3113 ll  3439 ul  2786 p 0001

 the mortality rate of sars-cov infection is more than covid-19 infection p 0001 by also considering their cumulative mortality rate with p 0001 recovery event rate of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below and the forest plots are illustrated in figure 2

logit er  1706 ll  1137 ul  2276 p 0001
 so the recovery rate of sars-cov infection is more than covid-19 infection p 0001 with the same results using the cumulative recovery rate with p 0001 incidence vs mortality results of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below the forest plots illustrated in figure 2b show the relations between the two diseaseslog rr  4089 ll  4512 ul  3666 p 0001
log rr  9845 ll  11074 ul  8615 p 0001
 and the mortality rate is higher than the incidence rate in both infection groups and subgroup analysis showed that in sars infection the mortality rate is more than incidence rate in comparison to covid-19 disease p 0001 cumulative incidence vs mortality rateof covid-19 and sars-cov infections reflected the above results with p 0001 recovery vs mortality results of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below the forest plots are illustrated in figure 3

log rr  1895 ll  1300 ul  2489 p 0001
 which resulted the recovery rate is more than the mortality rate in both infectious groups and subgroup analysis has shown that in sars infection the recovery rate vs mortality rate is higher than that of covid-19 p 0008 and cumulative recovery rate vs mortality rate of covid-19 and sars-cov infections reflected the above results with p 0001 some recent news reported that the covid-19 has more mortality rate than the combination of sars and mers 12 however one should note that while this comes to statistical analysis the whole population of the world and countries are essential factors the rapid virus spread known as also super spreading people played a vital role in previous sars-cov case fatality rate of 96 and mers case fatality rate of about 38 outbreaks and also needs special attention in covid-19 as well 13 in summary we demonstrated the statistical analyses of incidence mortality and recovery rates between covid-19 and sars-cov along with their subgroups analysis and hopefully this would shed more evidence in controlling the new infectious disease the limitations of the current meta-analysis are as belowthe use of open datasetsall data were observational numbers reported for incidence mortality and recovery valuesonly the countries with higher incidence values those which are high-risk countries based on who criteria assessment are involved in the current meta-analysis which might be influenced by selection bias in the futuredue to the nature of the meta-analysis the evaluation of publication bias was not possible
 the current meta-analysis provided more information on incidence mortality and recovery rates between covid-19 and sars-cov infectious diseases based on event rate evaluation the incidence rate of covid-19 was higher than sars-covs where mortality and recovery rates for sars-cov were higher in comparison with covid-19 on the other hand the risk ratio and subgroup analysis of incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality for both covid-19 and sars-cov revealed new findings those were the higher mortality and recovery rates of both sars-cov and covid-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates respectively the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest  survival of respiratory viruses on fresh produce m ypiz-gmez susana charles gerba p kelly bright r   there are

transmission is at times difficult to determine and is often a point of contention among researchers in addition unusual circumstances or conditions may lead to an atypical route of transmission for respiratory viruses for instance environmental contamination by stools played a significant role in the transmission of sars coronavirus in certain outbreak populations in china dowell et al 2004 chu

2003 all purified virus stocks were stored at 80 c until used in experiments iceberg lettuce lactuca sativa strawberries fragaria ananassa and raspberries rubus idaeus were purchased directly from local markets the produce samples were placed in 250-ml autoclavable wide mouth bottles with screw caps nalgene west chester pa usa to about one-third capacity in the following manner the outer three or four leaves of lettuce were discarded whole interior leaves were cut into pieces 2  2 cm with a sterile razor approximately 810 g of cut leaves were added to each lettuce sample bottle two whole strawberries weighing between 15 and 20 g for a total of 3040 g and four whole raspberries weighing between 4 and 5 g each for a total of 1620 g were added to each of the strawberry and raspberry sample bottles respectively the efficiency of recovery of each virus from produce was first assessed the produce was inoculated with either 10 ml of ad2 25  109 tcid50 total 5 ml of cov229e 50  104 tcid50 total or 10 ml of pv1 18  107 plaque forming units pfu total using a pipette to carefully and evenly add the viral solutions drop-by-drop onto the produce the caps of the bottles were then replaced and the bottles were manually rotated to ensure total coverage of the produce by the virus suspension the inoculated produce was then incubated for 15 min at room temperature before processing all of the tests were performed in triplicate viruses were eluted from the produce by the addition of 90 ml of phosphate-buffered saline pbs ph 90 sigma-aldrich st louis mo usa to the bottles for the pv1 and ad2 experiments only 45 ml of pbs was added to the samples inoculated with cov229e to minimize the amount the virus was being diluted since the initial stock concentration was fairly low the bottles were then placed on an orbital shaker new brunswick scientific edison nj usa at 200 rpm for 10 min the pbs was collected using a pipette and placed in sterile bottles these

be assayed at once the filtered aliquots were frozen for subsequent virus assay at 20 c for ad2 and pv1 and at 80 c for cov229e since cov229e does not survive very well at 20 c the tcid50 method was used to assay the recovered ad2 and cov229e and the plaque assay method was used to assay the recovered pv1 as described previously to assess the survival of these viruses on produce the produce samples inoculated with virus as described previously were stored at 4 c for up to 10 days for ad2 and pv1 and 8 days for cov229e the following initial inocula titers were used 20  108 tcid50 of ad2 12  106 tcid50 of cov229e and 14  107 pfu of pv1 duplicate sample bottles were removed immediately time  0 h and also after various time intervals 1 2 4 8 or 10 days and eluted for viruses as described previously the filtered aliquots were also frozen for subsequent virus assay at 20 c for ad2 and pv1 and at 80 c for cov229e and assayed as described previously a students t test two-tailed assuming unequal variances was used to compare the survival of the viruses on different types of produce a p value of  005 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between the levels of the recovered viruses table 1 shows the recovery efficiencies of ad2 cov229e and pv1 from produce ad2 was recovered with an efficiency of 565  from lettuce its recoveries from strawberries and raspberries were lower 3235  the recovery efficiencies of cov229e and pv1 were only determined from lettuce and strawberries raspberries were eliminated from these experiments because of their short shelf-life before deterioration pv1 had the greatest recovery efficiency from lettuce 767  of any of the viruses on any of the produce nevertheless both pv1 and cov229e were not recovered well from strawberries 006 
 table 2 shows the survival of ad2 on produce after 8 days at 4 c the recovered ad2 levels decreased by 175 log10 on lettuce 165 log10 on strawberries and 060 log10 on raspberries after 10 days these reductions increased to 197 log10 238 log10 and 114 log10 respectively
 table 3 shows the survival of cov229e on lettuce stored at 4 c strawberries were not included in the survival experiment with cov299e because of the inability to detect the virus during the initial recovery efficiency determination tests cov229e declined by 020 log10 after 2 days of storage and could no longer be detected by day 4 131 log10 reduction
 pv1 survival on lettuce stored at 4 c was fairly stable table 4 with no observed reductions until day 8 036 log10 by day 10 this reduction had increased to 103 log10 even though the recovery efficiency of pv1 from strawberries table 1 was very low 006  the recovered virus levels could still be used to determine its survival reductions in pv1 were observed as early as day 1 on strawberries 084 log10 nevertheless the measured reductions did not continue to increase over time during storage fluctuating between a low of 039 log10 day 10 and 124 log10 day 8 this is likely due to the variability in the assay in addition it is possible that the number of viruses recovered from strawberries on day 0 was overestimated therefore the reductions calculated using this number would be overestimated this seems likely since the reductions observed were immediate but then remained relatively stable for 9 days
 in this study we determined the efficiency of recovery of two human respiratory viruses ad2 and cov229e and one enteric virus pv1 from lettuce strawberries and raspberries in addition the survival of these three viruses on produce during storage at a refrigeration temperature of 4 c was determined such survival data are important in determining the risks of exposure over time following the contamination of produce and its subsequent storage the recovery efficiency of 565  for ad2 from lettuce was comparable to the 55  of enteric adenovirus type 6 recovered from lettuce by ward et al 1982 in a previous study nevertheless our recovery of ad2 from strawberries and raspberries was lower than those reported for enteric viruses 50  in other studies bidawid et al 2000 le guyader et al 2004 butot et al 2007 for example bidawid et al 2000 reported a recovery of 81  of hepatitis a virus from strawberries however they used immunomagnetic beads and positively charged virosorb 1mds filters to assist in virus capture and concentration pv1 was recovered with an efficiency of 767  from lettuce in this study this is greater than the 58  recovery efficiency reported by ward et al 1982 in contrast the recovery of pv1 from strawberries was only 006  demonstrating that virus recoveries from different types of produce can vary significantly similarly the recovery efficiency of cov229e from lettuce was 196  whereas the virus was not recovered from strawberries such differences between the recoveries of viruses from berries versus lettuce are likely due to the fact that fruits such as strawberries and raspberries have a porous surface texture which may trap viruses beyond the reach of chemical disinfectants or eluents richards 2001 alternatively the elution process itself may cause damage to the surfaces of soft fruits resulting in greater virus retention the low ph of fruits which are typically below those of vegetables may also affect the sorption of viruses to the produce surface and therefore their recovery the ph of strawberries is 3039 raspberries is 2935 and iceberg lettuce is 60 martin-diana et al 2005 roberts et al 2005a b basic buffers ph 7495 are recommended as eluents to extract viruses from acidic fruits in order to prevent a drop in the ph of the eluent during the elution process which may reduce virus recovery croci et al 2008 le guyader et al 2004 reported that detecting viruses on berries particularly raspberries is difficult because of the presence of various inhibitors as well as the low ph butot et al 2007 found recovery efficiencies of 199 042 and 11  of hepatitis a virus norovirus and rotavirus respectively from fresh strawberries and similarly low efficiencies of 23 31 and 13  for these three viruses respectively from frozen raspberries during postharvest transportation strawberry shelf-life can be increased to 510 days postharvest by using controlled atmospheres while maintaining the transport temperature between 0 and 5 c transfresh corporation 2011 strawberry producers also recommend not washing berries until just before serving and to avoid contact with moisture eg misters in the food market such moisture causes rapid breakdown of the berries raspberries are very perishable and should always be kept between 0 and 1 c under ideal conditions strawberries should have a shelf-life of 25 days and raspberries should have a shelf-life of 12 days in the consumers refrigerator in the virus survival experiments the produce samples were stored in covered bottles to avoid evaporation of the inoculum volume during storage however the fruits started to deteriorate before day 10 due to the excess moisture raspberry deterioration was much more pronounced than that observed with strawberries for this reason the survival of pv1 and cov229e on raspberries was not determined ad2 survived the longest on raspberries followed by lettuce and then by strawberries such observed differences in ad2 decay rates between raspberries and strawberries may be due to an uneven virus distribution over the fruit surfaces or to differences in the berry surface characteristics the ad2 reductions between raspberries and lettuce were significantly different after 8 days of storage at 4 c and between raspberries and strawberries after 1 day cov229e was very sensitive to the elution process the recovery efficiencies were low with no virus recovered from strawberries and only 196  recovered from lettuce in addition the cov229e fell to below the detection limit of our assay within 4 days of storage at 4 c these results are comparable with those obtained by gundy et al 2009 who reported that coronaviruses die-off very rapidly in wastewater enveloped viruses such as cov229e are typically less stable in the environment than non-enveloped viruses such as ad2 and pv1 watanabe et al 1989 barker et al 2001 pv1 can withstand a wide range of ph and temperature variations jaykus 2000 the acidity of the strawberries may therefore inactivate cov229e more readily than the non-enveloped ad2 and pv1 in addition some fruits including strawberries blueberries and grapes contain quercetin which has been shown to have antiviral properties in cell culture experiments davis et al 2008 in this study the enteric pv1 appeared to survive longer than both respiratory viruses on lettuce and strawberries with only 103 log10 reductions after 10 days of storage at 4 c compared to no cov229e being recovered after 4 days on lettuce and reductions of 197 log10 and 238 log10 of ad2 on lettuce and strawberries respectively after 10 days survival studies of poliovirus on soft fruit and salad vegetables performed by kurdziel et al 2001 found a linear decline of poliovirus of 0086 log10 per day for lettuce stored at 4 c for 15 days they reported a decline of 012 log10 of poliovirus on frozen strawberries stored at 20 c for 15 days raspberry samples displayed severe deterioration by day 9 but no significant decline in poliovirus was observed the results of this study demonstrate that respiratory viruses may persist on fresh fruit and vegetables for several days at the refrigeration temperature commonly used to store fresh produce in the average consumer household contamination of fresh produce may therefore result in the transmission of not only the enteric viruses that are traditionally considered foodborne pathogens but also possibly respiratory viruses such as adenoviruses coronaviruses and influenza viruses that can infect via contact with mucosal membranes considering the low infectious dose of many viral agents there will always be a risk of infection from the exposure to or consumption of food contaminated with respiratory or enteric viruses if no regular preventive produce surface sanitization is performed this is of particular concern for uncooked fruits and vegetables in addition food handlers that are ill with respiratory rather than non-gastrointestinal disease could still pose a potential health risk for food consumers particularly while preparing finger foods that come into contact with the consumers hands which can then transfer the viruses to the mucosa via hand to mouth contact or by rubbing the eyes or nose hendley et al 1973 goldmann 2000 the world health organization has highlighted the importance of hygiene particularly that of hands in minimizing the spread of respiratory tract infections hendley et al 1973 rusin et al 2002 bell 2006 numerous respiratory viruses can survive on hands for significant

economic prospects monthly  research 44 020 3910 8015  with much of the global economy now in some form of lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic we expect world gdp to contract by about 7 in h1 2020 activity is expected to rebound sharply in h2 but even so the severity of the shock is likely to lead to a permanent gdp loss for the global economy  while chinese activity picked up in late-q1 as lockdown restrictions were unwound we expect q1 gdp to have fallen 12 qq before rebounding sharply in q2 but this q2 boost looks set to be swamped by the collapse in activity caused by the rest of the world going into lockdown  although shutdown restrictions elsewhere are less severe than those imposed in china business survey and labour market data still point to sharp falls in activity in most countries in q2 quarterly gdp declines of 8 or more in the us and eurozone seem likely overall world gdp could fall by about 7 in h1 roughly double the size of the contraction during start of the global financial crisis in   in those economies subject to some form of lockdown we expect restrictions to begin to be lifted during q2 as a result growth should resume in q3 as sectors that have been forced to shut down see some pick-up but despite this rebound world gdp is now seen shrinking 28 in 2020 overallin 2009 the global gdp fall was 11  the h2 pick-up followed by a return to more normal conditions next year will result in world gdp growth rising to almost 6 in 2021 helped also by the recent collapse in oil prices to about 30pb but the scale of the disruption means that we expect a permanent loss of output from the shock we expect global gdp in the medium term to be some 15 below the level we had anticipated before the coronavirus outbreak  the risks around this forecast are large and broadly balanced but were stringent lockdowns or widespread disruption perhaps due to renewed outbreaks of the virus to extend into q3 global gdp could fall by as much as 8 this year the impact of the swathe of lockdowns means that we now expect global gdp to shrink 28 in 2020 the impact of lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on the global economy will be devastating we expect world gdp to plunge by about 7 in h1 but as restriction are lifted during q2 activity should rebound leading to sharp rises in global gdp in q3 and q4 we expect the h1 contraction in global gdp to be double the size of the fall during the global financial crisis  a decade-long streak of monthly employment gains ended abruptly in march as the initial effects of the coronavirus pandemic led to a sharp job loss of 701000 but while the report may have looked dark it will pale in comparison to the expected 24 million job losses in april we foresee the unemployment rate surging to 14 in april and 16 in may with a cumulative job loss over two months of around 27 millionthree times more than during the gfc  unprecedented fed stimulus and unparalleled fiscal support will provide an essential lifeline to the economy but even with 25tn of stimulusincluding a multi-trillion business lending capacitythe new normal of fear will feature only a gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and a slow recovery until a medical solution to coronavirus ends the crisis  given the severity of the economic and labor market shock and the expectation for a gradual and uneven easing of lockdown measures in q3 we forecast a u-shaped rebound with the structurally vulnerable states taking the longest to recover  with our triple p rule for a recession being fulfilled the current prolonged profound and pervasive contraction in economic activity has brought an end to the longest us economic expansion on record this downturn in activity will be pervasivenot confined to just one sector or region of the economy profound -not only a blip and prolongedit will last several months with the number of infections rising exponentially across the country and states representing up to 75 of us gdp under stay-at-home orders we expect to see deep cutbacks on a wide range of discretionary spending we see consumer spending contracting more than 13 in q2 2020at 43 annualized this would be the sharpest drop on record we also see business investment contracting 14 in q2 or 46 annualized with the oil price crash adding a drag from the energy sector policy measures will help offset the shock but cannot prevent it the feds response to the gcr has been exemplary delivering rapid policy stimulus via traditional and emergency measures after cutting interest rates to the effective lower bound the fed has launched multiple lending facilities aimed at reducing stress in the treasuries mortgage-backed securities commercial paper money markets dollar muni and corporate debt markets congress has passed the cares act a record 22tn stimulus package providing fiscal stimulus loans and loan guarantees amounting to 9 of gdp the three-pronged cares act will support households via direct checks to lowand middle-income families along with an expansion of unemployment benefits worth a combined 540bn it directs 150bn to state and local governments and it will support large and small businesses via nearly 1tn of loans loan guarantees and bailout funds while these measures will support the economy and the recovery a rebound in h2 2020 ultimately hinges on successful containment measures a short very sharp recession could become more protracted if key risks materialize  indebted corporate sector a highly leveraged corporate sector with a large amount of low-quality corporate bonds represents a key risk to the economy amid this sudden stop  labor market shock we anticipate cumulative job losses of 27 million due to the coronavirus pandemic with the bulk of losses coming in april as the unemployment rate surges to 14  struggling business investment the sudden stop in domestic and global activity a stronger dollar rising corporate spreads and plunging energy investment will lead to a sharp contraction in business investment  trade collapse major supply chain disruptions and a halt to tourism activity point to a protracted slump in trade flows as imports and exports fall across 2020 after cutting the federal reserve policy rate 150bp to the effective lower bound the fed revived emergency funding facilities and launched new ones not stopping at more generous funding terms and a wider range of collateral the fed has since implemented new emergency credit and funding measures as well as greatly increasing the size of qe support has come for primary and secondary market corporate bond liquidity municipal bond issuance and reserve requirements but its perhaps what the fed is doing in conjunction with treasury and congress that will provide the greatest support to the economy roughly 425bn in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act aims at supporting up to 4tn in lending by the fed to businesses and state and local governments meanwhile the main street business lending facility and the newly announced facility to back small-business lending appear to have tremendous firepower despite the bleak situation currently the us economy should return to growth of just under 17 per year in 2022-30 as the economy grows broadly in line with its potential  flexible labor force the us will maintain the flexibility of its labor force giving it an advantage over its peers  steady productivity we look for productivity growth to sustain a steady but modest pace in the long term  population challenges lower census population projections have cut our long-run growth estimate by 01ppt  we have slashed our 2020 gdp forecast as the impact of the coronavirus in q1 was larger than we expected previously we estimate q1 gdp to have plunged 85 yy but while the coronavirus outbreak is accelerating globally it has now been contained in china allowing the government to lift most remaining restrictions on peoples movements we look for a significant recovery from q2 onwards as economic life returns to normal however the sequential recovery will be weighed down by weak domestic demand due to reluctant consumers and plunging foreign demand as many key trade partners fall into recession we forecast gdp to contract by 02 in 2020  industrial value added investment retail sales and exports all contracted sharply in january-february while daily indicators on economic activity clearly showed a pickup in march the speed of resumption was disappointing and the economy was still operating substantially below normal levels at the end of march that said a sequential recovery is in the making the pmis in march point to a sequential pick-up from the extraordinarily low level of output in february  the government has implemented a range of fiscal and monetary measures but so far the measures have been targeted and modest in size while we expect more policy support in the coming months we think it will remain limited given concerns about leverage and financial instability  in this context we expect a slower recovery than many other forecasters and see basically no growth in 2020 despite their earlier lofty growth ambitions we think policymakers will eventually accept such a sluggish outturn this year given that major stimulus remains unpopular in beijing growth could be higher if major stimulus was announced but a deeper global contraction is a downside risk we think chinas policymakers will eventually accept a sluggish economic outturn this year and we forecast 2020 gdp to contract 02 we now expect gdp to contract 85 yy in q1 followed by a sequential recovery from q2 onwards forecast overview the novel coronavirus outbreak was a huge drag on q1 growth amid production and transport disruptions industrial value added plunged 135 yy in january-february combined fixed asset investment plummeted by 245 yy while retail sales tumbled 205 we also estimate that export volumes contracted 165 yy economic activity clearly picked up in march as suggested by daily indicators on coal consumption of power plants road congestion and property sales moreover the pmis have bounced back while labour resumption reached 80-90 in large firms and 75-80 in small firms at end-march nonetheless the economy was still operating substantially below normal levels at that time after a plunge in q1 gdp we expect a sequential recovery from q2 onwards as economic life returns to normal within china we also expect policies already rolled out to support the economic recovery and more easing will come however lingering fear of the virus and uncertainty over the business outlook and job losses mean domestic demand will remain weak while sliding external demand as much of the rest of the world falls into recession will be a major drag we now forecast gdp to plunge 85 yy in q1 and contract 02 in 2020 as a whole we see the risks to this forecast as balanced the key downside risk is that the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak internationally could be deeper and longer lasting the main upside risk is a larger stimulus than we anticipate the main factors affecting our short-term outlook are  external demand to fall sharply global demand is plunging as many key trade partners fall into recession new export orders dropped and will decline much further in the coming months reflecting weak domestic demand and exports import volumes will likely fall sharply with services imports down much more than those of goods due to the virtual halt of outbound tourism and travel  domestic demand affected by coronavirus outbreak we expect household consumption to be negatively affected for many months to come and see only gradual recovery from q2 onwards especially for social consumption such as spending in restaurants and hotels we think investment will do better especially in new industries infrastructure and real estate  that said as the country returns to normal renewed outbreaks and lockdowns will add to peoples caution and will weigh on the recovery meanwhile many smes have been hammered by the economic stand-still and may go bankrupt even many financially solid companies will remain more reluctant to invest for some time  policy easing to support recovery policies already rolled out include cuts in interest rates and reserve requirement ratios lending support for struggling borrowers infrastructure investment tax relief and employment and consumption subsidies so far policy easing has remained modest and we dont expect that stance to change significantly given concerns about adding to leverage and financial instability although the key fiscal policy parameters have not yet been announced we expect the fiscal deficit to increase from 55 of gdp to around 8 or so this year including local government bond issuance and usage of carry over and surplus funds this is a significant rise but implies a much smaller stimulus than in 2008-09 and those announced by many developed countries we basically expect no growth in 2020 we also expect policymakers to acknowledge that in the absence of huge stimulus it wont be possible to achieve 3-4 gdp growth let alone the 56 that would be necessary to achieve the policy target of doubling gdp compared to 2010 indeed we forecast gdp to contract 02 in 2020 however we do expect a return to significant year-on-year growth in h2 and a full-year rebound to 9 growth in 2021 medium-term challenges persist beyond the coronavirus shock including the ongoing trade and tech tensions with the us an overall slower real estate activity trend and stillsignificant excess capacity in heavy industry in addition the reform agenda remains large notably as regards soes the financial sector and ensuring high-quality urbanisation indeed continued implementation of supply side reforms is vital to enable robust organic growth over the medium term the next decade will see much slower growth in china we expect slower capital accumulation we also think total factor productivity tfp growth will be slower in part because gains from further integration into the global economy will be more modest than in the past especially given the backdrop of us-china tech tensions  the risks remain firmly skewed to the downside should disruptions from the spread of the coronavirus turn out to be larger and more long-lasting than currently assumed the impact on the economy would be significantly worse and further out possibly prevent a strong recovery  the government is working on a major fiscal stimulus package to support firms and households affected by coronavirus-related disruptions planned measures aim to provide financial support to firms that maintain employment postpone tax and social security charges and provide households with direct cash transfers among others meanwhile the bank of japan boj in mid-march announced it would temporarily step up asset purchases and introduce a new lending programme but left its negative 01 policy rate and 0 government bond yield target unchanged gdp now expected to see the largest contraction since the global financial crisis the coronavirus pandemic will severely disrupt the economy in 2020 world economic prospects monthly  japan with the coronavirus pandemic continuing to disrupt activity in japan and worldwide we expect gdp to record a sharp contraction in 2020 domestic demand will fall rapidly as people stay at home which will add to pressure on sectors already hit by the collapse in travel crumbling foreign demand and supply chain disruptions will hit manufacturers and exporters likely leading to cutbacks in investment spending wage cuts and a rise in unemployment we now expect gdp in 2020 to shrink 48 this is 28ppt below our mid-march projection and 45ppt below our projection of four weeks ago highlighting how quickly the pandemic and the containment measures to fight it have clouded the economic outlook in japan and across the world for 2021 we forecast gdp to grow 39 with the now-postponed tokyo olympics providing a modest but welcome boost  consumption outlook extremely challenging while japan avoided large-scale lockdowns and drastic restrictions on movement in the first quarter of 2020 tourism has come to a near-standstill and spending has declined as public spaces have been closed and large events cancelled retail sales of food medicine and health-related products saw a pick-up in february but spending on various services and non-essential goods declined leading indicators suggest more and more people are staying at home as the government is urging the population to avoid gatherings and work from home with the recently-announced state of emergency wage freezes softening employment conditions collapsing consumer confidence metrics and a generally vulnerable consumer outlook after last years tax hike consumption will likely see a major set-back in 2020  investment to plunge as global economy enters recession after a sharp contraction in capital spending in q4 domestic machinery orders and production of capital and investment goods started 2020 on a weak note meanwhile foreign machinery and machinery tool orders will deteriorate as the spread of the coronavirus disrupts activity in japans main trade partners the latest tankan results show business sentiment and business forecasts worsened markedly in march 2020 particularly for non-manufacturing firms especially in tourism-related industries with the global economy entering a very sharp recession we expect business investment to fall markedly in 2020  exports and imports to fall sharply despite a modest 15 yy fall in real exports in february a 12 drop in import volumes on the back of a hefty contraction in imports from china highlights supply chain disruption with chinese data showing massive declines in activity in february most of the global economy now under lockdown and a rapidly worsening employment picture in the us we expect forthcoming data to show very large declines in exports domestically falling spending by firms and households will exacerbate import weakness  production to slide as coronavirus takes its toll industrial production was 25 down on the year in february after -23 yy in january while the manufacturing pmi fell to 448 in march down from 478 in february with industry forecasts pointing to large falls in production in march and major japanese car makers announcing partial suspensions we expect industrial production to weaken markedly in 2020  financial market turmoil spurs boj into action after a selloff in financial markets and emergency action by global central banks the boj in mid-march unveiled measures to soften the economic and financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic focussing on temporarily raised asset purchases and a new lending programme but leaving its negative 01 policy rate and 0 bond yield target unchanged the boj further announced lower rates and longer maturities on its us dollar supply operations matching the feds upgrade to its global dollar swaps meanwhile headline cpi weakened to 04 yy in february from 07 in january  government working on major stimulus package the government is working on a supplementary budget to fund a major stimulus package to support firms and households affected by coronavirus-related disruptions adding to emergency measures for smes and workers already deployed the government is reportedly aiming to increase financial support for firms to maintain employment postpone tax and social security charges and provide households with direct cash transfers  financial markets to remain volatile while uncertainty persists japanese stock markets have sold off and lost about 25 of their value since january while the yen has strengthened and bond yields declined although these moves have partly reversed we expect financial markets to remain volatile and see the yen continuing to trend higher appreciating to 106 to the dollar by end-2020  with the number of infected people rising across the continent and partial or full lockdown measures in place in most european countries the economic impact from the health crisis is going to be massive with the eurozone heading for an historically deep recession in h1 given the extension and escalation of containment measures in many countries we have slashed our 2020 gdp forecast to a fall of 51 from 06 growth seen last month before a strong pick-up to 46 growth in 2021 the unprecedented nature of the crisis means that volatility around our forecasts is extremely high  pmi figures for march showed the initial impact from the coronavirus outbreak and the containment measures put in place in many countries the eurozone pmi collapsed to a new historic low of just 314 in march from 516 in february following the pattern shown earlier by china the decline in services activity was much deeper than in manufacturing although we expect the april figures could be even worse as they will reflect the implementation of harsher lockdowns in most countries  the unprecedented nature of the crisis is leading to extraordinary volatility around our forecasts our baseline assumes the brunt of the impact will be centred around march and april with a gradual recovery afterwards which should speed up later in h2 as lockdowns are lifted and monetary and fiscal stimulus feeds through  but the evolution of the disease continues to be key in determining the final economic damage the main risk to the forecast is that health conditions force a delay in the return to normal activity leading to a much shallower recovery than currently anticipated an insufficient fiscal response would also mean a weaker recovery and a larger permanent loss in output  forecast overview as most european countries are implementing partial or full lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus the eurozone economy faces a collapse in economic activity in the short term as expected the march pmis showed the initial impact from the health crisis with indices falling to new record lows similar to what was seen earlier in china the decline in services was much more acute as the initial trade and supply-side shock morphed into a massive domestic demand shock with lockdowns being put in place and in some cases extended to all non-essential activities the effects on consumption and retail trade will be devastating combined with the impact that travel bans are having on the tourism sector and related activities we expect the euro area economy will suffer an historically large fall in gdp in q2 as a result we now expect gdp to contract 51 in 2020 as a whole compared with our forecast of a 06 expansion last month this would represent the largest fall in gdp in a single year in the history of the euro area the unprecedented nature of the crisis adds an extreme degree of volatility to our forecasts the final economic damage will largely depend on the evolution of the disease and the severity and length of containing measures that governments put in place as well the size of the policy response our baseline assumes the brunt of the hit will be in march and april with a gradual recovery thereafter in h2 however there is a high level of uncertainty around the speed of the recovery and activity in some sectors is likely to remain depressed for a longer period the coronavirus outbreak and the severe containing measures will lead to a short-term economic collapse but we still anticipate a strong rebound in 2021 as containing measures are lifted daily activities are resumed and the impact from monetary and fiscal policy stimulus starts to feed through these factors underpin our forecast  a collapse in consumer spending lockdowns and social distancing measures will cause consumer spending to collapse in h1 with around half of total spending at risk of delay or loss we still expect a rebound when containing measures are lifted but one of the critical channels to watch will be the potential damage to the labour market although most countries are putting  source  oxford economicshaver analytics world economic prospects monthly  eurozone policies in place to protect jobs a surge in unemployment would cause lasting damage and slow the subsequent recovery we see consumer spending declining 54 in 2020 but rebounding 50 in 2021  investment to contract in 2020 investment was stronger than expected in 2019 but this partly reflected huge swings in investment data in ireland that caused volatility in the overall eurozone figures but the sharp deterioration in economic activity and sentiment and the surge in uncertainty this year will have a big impact on capital spending as well with the crisis perhaps risking permanent damage to large parts of the corporate sector the outlook for business spending could be permanently affected unless strong public intervention takes place to cushion the impact we now see fixed investment falling 76 in 2020  exports will be severely hit as well the combined impact that travel bans will have on tourism and exports of services and the decline in global merchandise trade owing to the collapse in activity means that total exports will contract sharply in h1 this year but the collapse in domestic demand will also cause imports to fall sharply so the contribution from net trade to growth should be broadly neutral this year we expect exports to decline 64 this year the worst outcome since the global financial crisis before rebounding by 68 in 2021 as travel restrictions and global trade return to normality the sharp and rapid deterioration in economic and financial conditions due to the coronavirus outbreak has forced the ecb to act following the example of other central banks across the world after the announcement of a broad stimulus package at its 12 march meeting which included an increase in asset purchases and changes to the tltro programme to improve liquidity conditions the ecb announced a further scaling up of its qe programme at an emergency meeting only days later the central bank will now purchase 11tr of bonds in 2020 a move that has calmed bond markets and which allows governments the space to increase their debt issuance substantially on a longer-term horizon the weak growth and inflation outlooks mean that we still expect monetary conditions to remain ultra-loose for an extended period we do not expect interest rates to start to rise until 2023  at around 30 of gdp the fiscal response is one of the largest in the world and the largest in the countrys history and should help to limit the economic fallout it is dominated by loan guarantees and tax deferrals meant to inject ample liquidity to keep firms alive household incomes and employment should benefit from a subsidy of reduced working hours the budget deficit may soar to around 5 of gdp as a result loan guarantees and potential nationalisations will amplify the effect on public debt but given monetary policy support and low debt levels that is not a big concern  inflation is bound to slow sharply in the coming months the steep drop in oil prices will weigh on energy prices and the recession is likely to reduce underlying price pressures we expect cpi inflation to slow to 09 this year from 15 in 2019 01 78 91 50 55  the drastic measures put in place by the government to limit the spread of coronavirus will bring the economy to standstill in h1 and provoke the worst economic recession since the world war ll we now see gdp contracting 53 this year before rebounding by 44 in 2021 as low oil prices and monetary and fiscal stimulus will support the resumption of discretionary spending once containment measures are lifted  the country has been in lockdown since 17 march and the official end-date of 15 april is likely to be delayed until early-may the shock will be concentrated in h1 with output falling 11 insee estimates the economy is operating at 65 of its capacity with the services sector hit particularly hard construction output is also at a standstill as unions have called for the suspension of work as they consider that the conditions for ensuring workers safety are not being met specifically a lack of masks  the shock to the labour market is massive so far more than 5m people are under the short-term work scheme that was extended and simplified by the government at the start of the lockdown this represents 25 of wage-earners in the private sector but as they are not counted as unemployed they will not inflate the unemployment rate that we see jumping to 98 in q2  the government has announced a 45bn equal to some 2 of gdp emergency package including deferral of corporate tax payments and an extended partial unemployment scheme aimed at preventing massive business insolvencies and preserving jobs moreover a 300bn envelope of public guarantees on corporate credits aims to help companies face liquidity issues however given the potential economic loss we think the final bill may be higher  the coronavirus pandemic means that italy will see a massive contraction in h1 2020 with a combination of virus-induced supply and demand shocks sending the country into a new and very deep recession while the uncertainty around our forecast remains very high the huge negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak and the severe measures taken to combat it have prompted us to slash our 2020 growth forecast we now see the italian economy shrinking by 76 in 2020 its sharpest drop since the second world war moreover the risks are clearly tilted to the downside and linked to the duration of the containment measures which we assume will be gradually lifted from early may  time-lags in data releases mean we will need to wait until at least the start of may before we see the first hard data related to march to gauge fully the economic impact of the virus outbreak in italy but the march composite pmi at 202 down from 507 in february is consistent with a massive quarterly gdp contraction in q1broadly in line with our current forecast of a 4 drop moreover base effects and the intensification of the lockdown measures in the second half of march with the cessation of non-essential manufacturing and construction mean that q2 will be hit even harder shrinking by more than 8 on the quarter  the shock to the labour market will be huge while official figures have yet to be published the number of people in the short-term work scheme is expected to account for around 10-20 of the total workforce but as they will not be counted as unemployed they will not inflate the unemployment ratewhich we see jumping to around 13 in q2 and q3 the combination of the governments emergency policies and the plunge in economic activity means that the fiscal deficit is likely to increase to about 9 of gdp this year with the government debt ratio jumping to 155 of gdp  the spread of the coronavirus and the extreme measures announced by the government to try to contain the epidemic will take a massive toll on the economy in h1 this year as a result we have slashed our growth projection for 2020 and now see gdp contracting 56 this year from 14 growth expected last month before a strong 42 rebound in 2021 as activity starts to stabilise in h2 this year the unprecedented nature of the crisis adds a high level of uncertainty to our forecasts as the final economic impact will be largely linked to the duration of the health crisis  we are finally starting to see the first data showing the initial hit from the coronavirus outbreak the pmis plunged in march with services activity suffering historically large falls as the sector collapsed under the weight of the lockdown measures similarly employment data showed massive losses with over 900000 jobs lost in the last two weeks of march as the government has extended the state of emergency another two weeks including a ban on all non-essential activities it looks certain that activity will collapse in march and april leading to a massive fall in gdp in q2  our view remains linked to the evolution of the disease as that will largely determine the length and severity of the containing measures we still anticipate a rebound later in h2 as the measures are lifted and normal daily activities resume slowly but some sectors are likely to remain depressed for a longer period  the government has announced a host of fiscal measures worth 17bn to soften the blow from the crisis with a much larger amount of funds potentially available in the form of state credit guarantees for companies however the severity of the crisis makes us think that deploying additional stimulus will be inevitable  the social distancing measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus will cause significant disruption to activity in the short term leading us to slash our 2020 uk gdp forecast to a fall of 51 from 07 growth seen last month but we expect a strong 60 rebound in 2021 as resumption of discretionary spending is supported by low oil prices and monetary and fiscal stimulus  with the coronavirus spreading rapidly the government has introduced increasingly restrictive social distancing measures over the past month currently people are only permitted to leave their homes for a limited number of reasons with most schools non-essential shops and leisure facilities closed our forecast assumes these measures remain in place until may before being gradually lifted this will cause significant disruption to activity and we now see gdp contracting by 10 in h1 2020  the mpc has reacted to the escalating crisis by cutting bank rate by 65bp to its effective floor of 01 and restarting quantitative easing with 200bn of asset purchases consisting of gilts and private sector securities it has also introduced a new term funding scheme with additional incentives for smes which aims to ensure a full pass-through of the rate cuts meanwhile the financial policy committee fpc and prudential regulation committee prc have instigated a number of measures aimed at sustaining the supply of credit  the chancellor has also provided substantial fiscal support including a job retention scheme which pays 80 of salaries for furloughed employees and income support for the self-employed we expect public sector net borrowing to reach 220bn 107 of gdp this year but without these measures there was a strong risk that recession could become depression nevertheless even assuming high usage of these schemes we expect to see a sharp rise in unemployment during 2020 world economic prospects monthly  uk the economy was weak prior to coronavirus prior to the spread of coronavirus to the uk the economic performance had been underwhelming despite an improvement in the business survey data in the aftermath of decembers decisive election result official data reported that gdp was flat in january since then the cips surveys have suggested that activity has weakened sharply initially because of disruption caused by the impact of coronavirus on other countries and then latterly from the introduction of social distancing measures in the uk the composite pmi fell to a record low level of 360 in march down from 530 in february with service sector activity hit particularly hard however the scale of the economic impact will remain unclear for some timebusiness survey data is typically of limited use in quantifying the scale of change at turning points while the first hard data for march will not be available until late-april retail sales and early-may gdp and sectoral output we now expect gdp to fall by around 10 in h1 2020 and by 51 in 2020 overall as the economy endures a sizeable supply shock the key transmission channels are  lower discretionary spending around 40 of consumer spending usually takes place in crowded areas and this will be drastically reduced while social distancing measures are in place  lower working hours the closure of schools for the majority of children will prevent many parents from working adding to the negative supply shock from individuals self-isolating but unable to work from home and a higher incidence of sickness  tightening in financial conditions equity prices ended q1 some 27 below their january peak the key risk now is that the supply shock and tightening in financial conditions morph into a demand shock which prevents a strong recovery when activity resumes this could happen if for example large numbers of firms facing   3-months-on-3-months with this fear in mind policymakers have been quick to intervene the coronavirus job retention scheme will pay 80 of salaries up to 2500 a month if employees are furloughed rather than laid off while the self-employment income support scheme offers self-employed workers grants worth 80 of their profits up to 2500 a month although we still expect unemployment to rise by more than 2 points in h1 2020 the uplift would be far higher without these schemes with the majority of vulnerable workers keeping their jobs we expect to see a strong rebound in gdp growth once social distancing measures are lifted the key drivers of the rebound will be  very low inflation though the recent depreciation of sterling and the uks large tax wedge mean that it will benefit less from the collapse in oil prices than many other economies our modelling suggests that the price of a litre of petrol should drop to around 1 over the next month from 130 at the start of the year this should mean that cpi inflation slows sharply dropping close to zero in the summer very low inflation will provide a sizeable boost to household spending power  loose monetary policy the mpc has cut bank rate by 65bp to its effective floor of 01 and restarted quantitative easing with 200bn of asset purchases consisting of gilts and private sector securities  government income support schemes we expect the various government policy measures to result in public sector net borrowing temporarily rising to 220bn 107 of gdp this year but with the boe restarting quantitative easing we do not expect the government to have problems financing the extra borrowing after the 51 contraction in gdp now seen this year a strong rebound to growth of 60 is forecast for 2021 but there is a huge degree of uncertainty surrounding these projections as with no historical precedents it is very difficult to forecast what happens next we judge the risks are skewed to the downside with the key uncertainties being around the length of the lockdown the severity of the nearterm decline in activity the extent of financial market spillovers and the degree to which government support schemes limit the increase in unemployment  while the outbreak has been contained in china allowing the government there to lift the bulk of mobility restrictions it is accelerating elsewhere resulting in tighter lockdown measures as a result activity has collapsed as evident in regional pmis which fell to record lows in march hit by both demand and supply side shocks emanating from the pandemic and even economies where the authorities had been slower to react to the health crisis such as russia and turkey have now come under severe stress with the former facing a double-whammy of coronavirus and oil shocks as are other oil producers however our baseline forecast still assumes a sequential recovery from q3 onwards as curbs on movement and activity are gradually eased  bracing for deep downturns governments have rushed to announce stimulus packages to ward off the impact of lockdowns though with a few exceptions chile malaysia poland these have been relatively modest in scale moreover there has been insufficient emphasis on shielding labour markets in general falls in consumer spending will be the main channel through which the social distancing measures and layoffs will weigh on the economy  forecast overview we see little probability of india emerging fully out of the 21day lockdown on 14 april we expect the more infected states to remain in partial lockdown till about the middle of q2 and stringent social distancing measures to remain in place for longer across the country not only will this push the economy into contraction in q2 it will also likely result in a full-year decline of 1 in 2020 this is because indias inherent economic fragilities and limited policy arsenal will hinder a strong rebound even once containment measures end our economic impact assessment is highly sensitive to the duration of the lockdown and its scale a prolonged lockdown -even though indias large share of day wage labourers and informal economy makes this undesirablewould lead us to revise our forecasts substantially lower with the spread of coronavirus forcing governments across latam to adopt containment measures we have slashed our growth forecasts for mexico to -39 and brazil to -27 both administrations have remained reluctant to implement lengthy and stringent curbs in chile we expect a -33 gdp contraction this year while colombia is seen shrinking by 05 lastly apart from the huge -32 contraction in venezuela we expect argentina to suffer the most with the lockdown deepening the ongoing recession to a -58 contraction all central banks have eased their monetary stance and liquidity conditions but the fiscal response has varied between countries domestic policy uncertainty and supply-side constraints have now been accompanied by a global plunge in business sentiment and a drop in demand for south african goods all weighing on the countrys economic recovery prospects the south african economy had already entered 2020 on a very fragile footing before the dramatic external developments related to the covid-19 pandemic emerged these factors will push the country into a deep economic contraction this year we forecast that real gdp will contract by 49 in 2020 south africa lost its final investment grade rating at the end of march and there is a real risk that the country wanders deeper into junk territory the slump in economic activity will result in a notable revenue underperformance while efforts to contain the virus will necessitate an increase in unplanned spending consequently the countrys fiscal  with russia going into a month-long public holiday to curb the spread of coronavirus we have had to cut our forecast further judging from early high-frequency data such as energy consumption economic activity slumped by about 16 in the first week of quarantine as consumer-oriented services ground to a halt and industry slowed using bottomup estimates of output informed by international experience and early real-time data we see overall activity contracting by at least 12-15 in q2 relative to our january baseline combined with a hit to growth of 24pp from lower oil prices assuming brent oil price averages 25-30pb in q2-q4 and assuming that quarantine lasts only a month and activity recovers gradually in h2 we now see russias gdp contracting by 64 in 2020 there are multiple downside risks to this forecast related to the length of quarantine path of recovery in h2 and the potential need to cut oil output upside risk would stem from higher fiscal stimulus which so far amounts to only 12 of gdp including 05 in credit guarantees higher oil prices achieved by a cut in oil output would not necessarily be net-positive for the economy strict lockdowns introduced across the cee in march will cause a significant disruption to economic activity in h1 we expect economies to contract sharply in both q1 and q2 followed by a strong recovery in h2 for overall 2020 we have lowered our gdp forecasts by 5-6pp across the region there is some variation in policy responses across countries with poland announcing a comprehensive fiscal easing package and qe programme the czech republic looks likely to introduce qe as well other countries with more limited fiscal and monetary capabilities such as romania and bulgaria will likely experience a weaker recovery in h2 currencies have weakened materially across the board amid a wider em sell-off and rising risk premia moreover expansionary fiscal policies resulting in substantially larger net borrowing needs together with central bank asset purchases mean currency weakness is unlikely to be reversed in the near term 111 119 96 10   efficacy and safety of lianhuaqingwen capsules a repurposed chinese herb in patients with coronavirus

 to our knowledge this is the first multicenter randomized clinical trial that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of lh capsule a chinese herb product in patients with covid-19 overall treatment with lh capsules for 14 days resulted in a significantly higher rate of and a shorter time to symptom recovery than control group usual treatment the rate of recovery of fever fatigue and coughing was also higher in treatment group the rate of conversion of viral rna assay however did not reach to statistical significance lh capsule had a favorable safety profile for the treatment of covid-19 sars-cov-2 has been shown to result in an injury of the respiratory tract nervous system general office of the national health and health commission 2020 the liver chai et al 2020 the heart esophagus kidney urinary bladder and the jejunum li et al 2020 zou et al 2020 the susceptibility of sars-cov-2 among the whole population might be related to the ability to potently bind with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 zhou et al 2020 sars-cov-2 could infect various cells in human with similar biological behaviors of sars-cov huang and herrmann 2020 zhou et al 2020 from the perspective of tissue tropism the pathological features of covid-19 mainly resembled those of sars coronavirus infection zhao et al 2020 in light of the high levels of homology of sequence among sars-cov-2 sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus medications that have been proven to be effective for sars and mers might also be adopted to the treatment of covid-19 li and de clercq 2020 unfortunately no existing antiviral medications are available for the treatment of covid-19 based on a nationwide study with 1099 patients from 552 hospital throughout mainland china we have recently reported that fever accounted for 887 of patients and cough accounted for 678 of patients after hospital admission guan et al 2020 in light of the lack of validated effective therapeutic approaches the medications that could ameliorate fever fatigue and coughing would be valuable for the clinical management of covid-19 lh capsules which is a patented product have been marketed since the outbreak of sars in 2003 in china the latest research showed that lh conferred suppression of the cytopathic effect of sars-cov-2 in vitro and reduced the viral loads in the cytoplasm and cellular membrane li et al 2020 lh could also suppress the replication of sars-cov zhu et al 2003 h3n2 h1n1 and h7n9
in vitro chinese academy of military hospital 2009 ding et al 2017 duan et al 2011 mo et al 2007 the inflammatory cytokine storm has been regarded as an excessive host-defense response to the virus xu et al 2020 zhe xu 2020 which can cause diffuse lung injury and predispose to the development of severe disease suppression of excessive release of inflammatory meditators is the holy grail for halting the progression to severe disease xu et al 2020 recent studies indicated that lh could dose-dependently inhibit the release of tumor necrosis factor- interleukin-6 macrophage chemokine protein-1 and induced protein-10 li et al 2020 and could also effectively abrogate the expression of tumor necrosis factor- interleukin-6 interleukin-1 interleukin-2 interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 mo et al 2007 thus ameliorating lung injury associated with inflammatory cell infiltration cui et al 2015 these in vitro findings have provided with the rationale for clinical application of lh capsules in covid-19 in our study treatment with lh capsules for 14 days markedly improved the rate of symptom recovery 577 at day 5 803 at day 10 and 915 at day 14 the time to symptom recovery was also significantly shorter in treatment group overall lh capsules have shortened the duration of fever fatigue and coughing by 1 3 and 3 days respectively the higher rate of clinical cure and recovery of chest ct manifestations could also be associated with the activity against sars-cov-2 and probably the anti-inflammatory effects there was a lack of statistical significance for the difference in the rate of and the time to conversion of viral assays these findings differed from those in the in vitro studies li et al 2020 possibly because of the difference in the model for observation human vs cell models and the study endpoints changes in the viral loads in human respiratory tract specimens vs viral loads in the cytoplasm in vitro no serious adverse events were reported supporting the safety of lh capsules for the treatment of covid-19 lh consists of the key components such as lonicera japonica and forsythia suspense which could block the binding of sars-cov-2 with the angiotensin converting enzyme niu et al 2020 pogostemon cablin has been shown to ameliorate diarrhea and improve the host-defense of the gastrointestinal tract zhou 2018 rhodiola rosea could ameliorate lung injury via the suppression of oxidative stress and apoptosis huangfu et al 2019 and abrogation of pulmonary inflammation yao and luo 2020 in addition rheum palmatum could effectively antagonize the binding of spike protein and the angiotensin converting enzyme ho et al 2007 and suppress the excessive release of inflammatory mediators thus ameliorating the lung injury dong et al 2017 these observations have provided the evidence regarding the antiviral effects of lh capsules the exploration of repurposed chinese herb product would be valuable to the treatment of covid-19 because apart from convalescent plasma no other medications with proven efficacy exist our findings indicated that lh capsules could be recommended to patients with covid-19 for reducing the symptom burden and improving clinical outcomes however there are some limitations of the study design no blinding was implemented because of the urgency of the outbreak that entailed a timely treatment and placebo-controlled trial would be unethical in light of the rapid outbreak of communicable diseases such as covid-19 the duration of treatment was established empirically and whether a prolonged duration would translate into the greater efficacy warrants further investigation an extended study would be needed to thoroughly explore the effects of lh capsules on the viral shedding and the resolution of all symptoms in summary lh capsules confer therapeutic effects on covid-19 by improving the recovery rate of symptoms shortening the time to symptom recovery and improving the recovery of chest radiologic abnormalities in light of the efficacy and safety profiles lh capsules could be considered for the treatment of covid-19 future double-blind prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of lh capsules in a larger patient population the study was funded by beijing municipal science and technology commission ncp emergency project hebei provincial department of science and

pavan kumar   at the world health international conference in geneva in january 2020 the world health organization who announced an outbreak of the new coronavirus the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus 2 from wuhan china has continued to spread around the world since january 2020 and has turned into a pandemic of the coronavirus disease covid-19 12 due to the rapid spreading potential and the absence of vaccines and drugs the contagious covid-19 devastated normal life around the world currently covid-19 has infected more than half a million of the population has killed more than 25000 people and has forced more than 3 billion to stay in their homes 3 many people started getting pneumonia without any reason and most of the cases were linked to wuhan seafood market where they sell fish and trade live animals the new coronaviruses lurking around the world are threatening our rule and the prevalence of fear and panic is increasing this has also affected the cryptocurrency market 45 the country in which the coronavirus has caused the most devastation after china is italy in italy hundreds of people are dying every day due to this deadly virus the corona virus is 900 times smaller than a human hair despite its size this small virus has scared the whole world in december 2019 the first case of covid-19 came from wuhan city in china 6-8 during the chinese new year migration the virus spread to other chinese provinces in early and mid-january 2020 the who 3 revealed that cases began to be detected in other countries by international travelers due to a lack of knowledge about this virus the covid-19 pandemic placed tremendous strain on everyone around the world to prevent further transmission strong preventive measures have intensified week-to-week however the numbers of infected cases are consistently increasing around the world even after undergoing lockdown mathematical approaches have been widely used to infer critical epidemiological transitions and parameters of covid-19 epidemic curve fitting surveillance data during the early transmission and other epidemic models have been frequently applied to generate forecasts of the covid-19 pandemic across the world 9-11 this study aims to identify the top 15 countries with the most confirmed cases with spatial mapping a comparison was done between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases deaths and recoveries and an advanced autoregressive integrated moving average arima model was used for predicting the spread of covid-19 trajectories for the next 2 months until july 7 2020 various studies have been presented for forecasting many epidemic diseases this research study analyzes dynamic models to generate 20-day forecasts of cumulative confirmed deaths and recoveries from covid-19 cases by country territory or conveyance generated on april 24 2020 the united states spain italy france germany the united kingdom turkey iran china russia brazil canada belgium the netherlands and switzerland were taken from the top 20 countries based on cumulative effect data the arima model assigns a weight to the considered past values and an error value to correct the modelling other basic regression and exponential models use all past values to predict future values so the arima model is preferred this study analyzed and extracted worldwide data based upon a time series data-based advanced prediction arima model approach for the top 15 covid-19-infected countries we used data from worldometer which reports the approximate data of cumulative cases for more than 170 countries worldwide including state- or province-level cases for some countries 12 we have collected the case data for each day at given stipulated times from january 21 2020 to april 24 2020 furthermore we preprocessed the top 15 countries data with their spatial locations to collect and create some spatial attributes for the overall available data sets to forecast the trajectory of covid-19 cases in addition as whole worldwide data is not available for stipulated times we did not create any worldwide pandemic forecasting some dates with cases of confirmed covid-19 along with total cumulative results of recovered cases and death cases were analyzed using statistical analysis along with spatial extinct we used the arima model with r r foundation for statistical computing and validated it using akaike information criterion aic the new projected data was used up to july 2 2020 for the creation of a trajectory projected score for each category case confirmed recovered and death recent reported cumulative data of confirmed cases deaths and recoveries of covid-19 from january 21 to april 26 2020 were obtained from worldometer the reported data were used to predict more than 60 days and to understand the positive effects in the near future as well as the projected trends over trajectories the different statistical phenomenological models in the r-language platform were used to analyze the disease-based trajectories model for prediction purposes the four models were used to analyze the aggregate data set for time series analysis this includes the arima model which is a mass model of two different models including the autoregression ar model and the moving average ma model 13 this model also used aic statistics and coverage of regression analysis another type of covid-19 like sars disease was analyzed without breaking the current situation or predicting the future perspective 14 the vector auto-average model was used to predict the spatial extinct while using remote sensing data for the purpose of the creation of a worldwide geographic information system gis map for three different variables 15 these three variables in the gis environment created a map of cumulative confirmed cases by country as well as recovered and death maps 16 the use of another statistical analysis was a generalized logistic growth model which generally is depicted as a scaling parameter for integrating an additional result-oriented value put method 17 some epidemic models used in disease epidemic conditions measure oscillates which are multiple peak parameters inferred in subepidemic and pandemic conditions to determine the projected outcomes 18 after standardizing all the models the data of the top 20 countries were included to analyze the forecasting models of differential spatial adjacent and projected trajectories which were analyzed up to july 2 2020 we used the gis and remote sensing to determine the pandemic mapping and analyze the upcoming effects of covid-19 ma is the present value of a series which is defined as a linear combination of past errors assuming the errors to be independently distributed with the normal distribution 1319 order q is defined as where order q of the ma process is obtained from the autocorrelation function acf plot this is the lag after which acf crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time we combined differencing with ma and ar models and the combined model can be expressed as here yt is the differenced series the predictors on the right-hand side include both lagged values of yt and lagged errors we call this an arima p d q model where the top 15 countries were identified using mapping of cumulative confirmed covid-19 cases from january to april 24 2020 for 200 nations as presented in figure 1 the top 15 countries with a high number of confirmed cases were stratified to include the data in a mathematical model the top 15 countries the united states spain italy france germany the united kingdom turkey iran china russia brazil canada belgium the netherlands and switzerland cumulative cases deaths and recoveries from covid-19 were compared in figure 2 the united states the united kingdom turkey china and russia saw a relatively fast spread of the disease there was a fast recovery ratio in china switzerland germany iran and brazil but a slow recovery ratio in the united states the united kingdom the netherlands russia and italy as shown in figure 2 in addition there were higher death rate ratios in italy and the united kingdom and lower death rate ratios in russia turkey china and the united states figure 2 furthermore data smoothening was applied to stabilize the data by removing changes in the level of a time series and therefore eliminating or reducing the trend and seasonality after this the forecast prediction model was applied by using ar and ma models to generate plots of the different trends in upcoming days the arima model was validated for the available current data using the aic value it estimates that the out-of-sample prediction error and lowest value are preferable its value were around 20 14 and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases deaths and recoveries from covid-19 respectively which represents less error the outcome of these predictions is presented in figure 3 our findings revealed linearity in the confirmed cumulative cases and showed a rapid exponential growth phase in the world which might occur roughly from april 8 to april 24 2020 when the number of covid-19 cases may rise steeply to nearly 1 million in the united states 220000 in spain 200000 in italy 180000 in france and 190000 in germany other countries that have a smaller number of cases but show a declining upward trend include switzerland germany and italy figure 2 however the cases of covid-19 in china remain stable figure 2 the arima model predicted confirmed cases deaths and recoveries for the next month from april 24 to july 7 2020 using the past 3 months of data in figure 3 cyan color figure 4 brown color and figure 5 green color with 95 confidence intervals along with the 95 confidence predicted line after april 24 the 80 and 70 confidence wide values are shown in light grey and light-yellow colors respectively the wide confidence intervals help to manage any sudden changes in the prediction of dynamic covid-19 cases during the next 2 months between april 24 and july 7 2020 the model predicted that the confirmed cases deaths and recoveries would be doubled in all countries except china switzerland and germany figures 3-5 it was also observed that the death and recovery rates will be faster when compared to confirmed cases during the next 2 months the associated mortality rate will be much higher in the united states spain and italy followed by france germany and the united kingdom the recovery rates will stay slow at first but then rapidly increase in the united states italy germany and france by the end of june 2020 figure 5 the covid-19 daily data was collected and cumulatively represented as a spatial map for more than 170 countries and territories the spatial map is useful to identify the intensity of covid-19 infections in the top 15 countries and the continents the recent reported data for confirmed cases deaths and recoveries for the last 3 months from january to april 2020 was represented and compared between the top 15 infected countries the arima model was used to predict estimated confirmed cases deaths and recoveries for the top 15 countries from april 24 to july 7 2020 its value was represented with 95 80 and 70 confidence intervals and the 95 confidence intervals were shown as the median interval between the 80 and 70 wide values the validation of the arima model was carried out using the aic for the available recent data its values were about 20 14 and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases deaths and recoveries from covid-19 respectively which represents acceptable results the observed predicted values showed that the confirmed cases deaths and recoveries will double in all countries except china switzerland and germany it was also observed that the death and recovery rates were faster when compared to confirmed cases during the next 2 months the associated mortality rate will be much higher in the united states spain and italy followed by france germany and the united kingdom the limitation of the arima model is that it does not support any volatility or in-between changes in the prediction periods the accuracy of the countries data accumulated from worldometer was a matter of trust for the representation of the whole study the forecast analysis of covid-19 dynamics showed a different angle for the whole world and it looks scarier than imagined interestingly the recovery numbers also look promising with resistance starting by july 2020 thus a slowdown in the surge of the covid-19 pandemic during the proceeding months depends upon various administrative interventions and public awareness about the spread of the covid-19 pandemic  covid-19 infection and recovery in various countries modeling the dynamics and evaluating the non-pharmaceutical mitigation scenarios yong zhang xiangnan yu hongguang sun geoffrey tick r wei wei bin jin  the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic radically impacts our lives while the transmissioninfection and recovery dynamics of covid-19 remain obscure a time-dependent susceptible exposed infectious and recovered seir model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of covid-19 evolution observed in the last three months till 3222020 in various provinces and metropolises in china the model results revealed the space dependent transmissioninfection rate and the significant spatiotemporal variation in the recovery rate likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems as well as full city lockdowns in china the validated seir model was then applied to predict covid-19 evolution in united states italy japan and south korea which have responded differently to monitoring and mitigating covid-19 so far although these predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the maximum infected population and the infectionrecovery rates within the different countries in addition a stochastic model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate covid-19 spread preliminary tests using the stochastic model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing covid-19 spread if not all of the infected people can be promptly diagnosed and quarantined  the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak a respiratory illness that started first detected in late december 2019 is a pandemic infecting 336000 people in more than 140 countries with the average fatality rate of 44 globally data up to 3222020 1  the covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating almost every aspect of life damaging global economy and altering both man-made and natural environments urgent actions have been taken but further effective and efficient strategies are promptly needed to confront this global challenge to address this challenge and promptly guide the next efforts it is critical to model the transmission infection and recovery dynamics of covid-19 pandemic mathematical models are among the necessary tools to quantify the covid-19 dynamics and are the primary objective motivating this study this study aims to model the covid-19 evolution for representative countries with apparent coronavirus cases including china united states us italy japan and south korea covid-19 spread in these countries under different starting initiation and detection times for example china had passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak and hit a milestone with no new local infections on 3192020 79 days from the onset 12312019 in wuhan china while the us coronavirus cases soared past 10000 on the same day this study will apply the core characteristics of covid-19 outbreak obtained in china to estimate the covd-19 spread in the us as well as other countries where the number of affected people has not yet reached its peak in addition this new pandemic may last for a relatively longer time than expected 2  no vaccine against sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is currently available 3  indeed a vaccine for prevention and infection control may not be ready before march 2021 for covid-19 considering the minimum 45 weeks for trial and at least 1 year for safety evaluation and final deployment efficient strategies are therefore needed to mitigate the 4 covid-19 outbreak possible non-pharmaceutical scenarios such as isolation of cases and contact tracing can be evaluated using mathematical models 4  to identify the most efficient strategy going forward this is another major motivation and the secondary task of this study to address the questions mentioned above this study is organized as follows section 2 proposes an updated seir model for covid-19 where s e i and r stand for susceptible exposed infectious and recovered people respectively 5  this model is then applied to fit and predict the covid-19 spread in various provinces and major cities in china resulting in abundant datasets to derive the core characteristics of the covid-19 dynamics of transmissioninfection and recovery section 3 predicts the spread of covid-19 in the other countries using the knowledge gained from china section 4 proposes a fully lagrangian approach to model the spatiotemporal evolution of covid-19 and then applies it to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate the virus spread section 5 reports the main conclusions several mathematical models have been applied for epidemic analysis of covid-19 the most widely used one so far is the well-known seir model for example peng et al 6 using data up to 2162020 proposed a generalized seir model to successfully estimate the key epidemic parameters of covid-19 in china and predicted the inflection point and ending time of confirmed covid-19 cases the seir model was also applied by li et al 7 using the observed data up to 262020 to compare the effect of city lockdowns on the transmission dynamics in different cities in china the sir model with time-dependent transmission and recovering rates was used by chen et al 8 using data up to 2202020 to analyze and predict the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in china the sir model was extended by wang et al 9 using data up to 2122020 to incorporate various time-varying quarantine protocols for assessing 5 interventions on the covid-19 epidemic in china the seir model and its modifications were also successfully applied by others 10 11 12 13  mostly for assessing the early spreading of in china previous applications of the popular seir model however may contain high uncertainty since they had limited data access for only a short period of the covid-19 outbreak as will be shown below the covid-19 dynamics have changed dramatically in the last three months likely due to the improvementadjustment of screeningtesting techniques public hospital system capabilities and the governments control policies for contagious diseases an updated much better version of the seir model is therefore needed and can be reliably built now for china since the detailed datasets are now available and the coronavirus outbreak ie  of people infected has passed its peak in china other models have also been used for specific purposes related to covid-19 including the global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the epidemic spread 14  the transmission model for risk assessment 15  and the synthetic contact matrix model for reproductive ratios for covid-19 16  to the best of our knowledge the classical stochastic epidemic models such as the discrete or continuous time markov chain model and the stochastic differential equation model have not yet been applied for covid-19 spread scenarios a preliminary stochastic model for evaluating covid-19 spread in a city will be developed and applied in section 4 this section focuses on the deterministic model the classical seir model considers constant parameters which may not well capture time-dependent dynamics hence the seir model is updated in section 21 and then tested in section 22 the classical seir model containing four populations s e i and r takes the form 17  where is the stock of susceptible population is the number of persons exposed to or in the latent period of the disease is the stock of infected is the stock of recovered population r denotes the number of susceptible people whom the infected people contact daily n is the sum of all the four groups of people              constant representing the constancy of population n p is the constant rate of infection ie representing the probability for the infected people to transform the susceptible people into infected ones is the constant rate for the exposed person transformed into the infected one and is the constant recovery rate defining the speed for the infected person to be cured or expired to allow for possible time-sensitive rates for covid-19 evolution we revise model 1 where represents the number of deaths which is one component in i is the rate for the healthy susceptible person to be transferred to the infected one by the exposed people note that covid-19 patients in the incubation period might be contagious too and is the number of 7 healthy susceptible people that are contacted by the exposed people daily now the infection rates can change with time and the infected persons are removed from the risk of infection also with a time-dependent rate of   if the recovered individuals can return to the susceptible status due to for example loss of immunity then the partial differential equation pde 2d for the time rate of change of needs one more sink term       where is the rate of the recovered individuals returning to the susceptible status we add the fractional-order pde 2e containing the death probability of while the other  which is the caputo fractional derivative 18 19 with order 0   1 when the order 1 model 2e reduces to the classical integer-order pde for the death evolution the fractional pde 2e is used here for two reasons first the evolution of deaths and cures may be characterized by a random process since the exact time for the recovered person to be initially infected is unknown ie the patient that died or was cured today may have been diagnosed yesterday or last week second some patients may not be treated in time after being infected making the death toll to evolve with a time memory therefore we extend the classical mass-balance equation of death cases to the fractional pde to characterize the random property and memory impact embedded in the temporal evolution of mortality the fractional pde 2e and its classical version will be compared below using real data we apply the seir model 2 to fit the infection and recovery of coronavirus in china up to 372020 and then predict the future evolution  figure 1  20 with solutions shown by the dotted lines in figure 1a  accurately fits the observed data at the early stage but then overpredicts the spread of covid-19 observed after 2122020 dynamics of transmission for covid-19 especially the recovery rate therefore changed in time in china likely due to the time-dependent conditions in for example medical care mentioned above a dynamic seir model therefore may be preferred for modeling covid-19 spread in china in addition compared to the fractional pde 2e the best-fit solution using the classical pde   for death evolution see the black dotted line in figure 1a  slightly overestimates the late-time growth of mortality the actual death toll in hubei province grew slower than that estimated by a constant rate model indicating that the memory impact may affect the late-time dynamics of death that can be better captured by the fractional fde 2e the best-fit solutions using model 2 fit the evolution of the infected and recovered populations well for the data recorded from hubei province and three large cities closely related to wuhan china  figure 1  the model can also predict well the observed time series of covid-19 spread from 382020 to 3222020 for most places except for shanghai city figure 1d  this is due to the oversea cases imported to shanghai whose number was increasing quickly after 332020 causing inconsistency of population and failure of the model shanghai pudong international airport one of the two airports located in shanghai city is the eighth-busiest airport in the world and the busiest international gateway of mainland china if deleting the coronavirus 9 cases imported from overseas model 2 can predict well the covid-19 data in shanghai  figure   2  therefore model 2 works well for various places in china while external sources can easily break the internal evolution especially the asymptotic status of covid-19 in china the resultant time-dependent recovery rate   is depicted in figure 3  where the rate fitted by the latest observation data point in the fitting period ie 372020 remains stable in the following prediction period the best-fit recovery rate is the highest for shanghai except for the impulse of   for wenzhou discussed below which is expected since shanghai has the best public health system of all of these cities contrarily hubei shows the lowest recovery rate likely due to its delayed response and the relatively limited public health capability at the beginning of the outbreak compared with shanghai february 2020 resulting in the sudden increase in the total recovery rate in addition a relatively large number of people working in wuhan returned to wenzhou in late january and it appears that the improved efficient screening process successfully identified the number of infected cases the new cases were 29000 from 1242020 to 1312020 in wenzhou with an average of 3600 new patients per day who were then immediately centralized for treatment it appears that this fast response helped to alleviate the spread of coronavirus in wenzhou 10  the best-fit parameters of model 2 are listed in table 1  and the initial values for each group of people are listed in table 2  we reveal three behaviors in model parameters first the best-fit s-shaped   figure 3 can be described by the sigmoid function    1   where a b and c are factors showing that the recovery rate increases exponentially before reaching stable this increase is likely due to the healthcare facility and experience improved with time in an accelerating rate before reaching their asymptote or maximum capacity second the rates and probabilities r  p and  affecting the covid-19 transmissioninfection slightly change in space and remain stable for a given site  table 1  the small spatial fluctuation of these rates may be due to the similar strategies of local government for we also introduce an index c to quantify the infection severity of covid-19 at different places where is the maximum number of cumulative infected people at the given site a smaller c represents a greater infection severity of coronavirus there is a power-law relationship between 11 the regional population n and the maximum cumulated number of infected people  figure   4  this empirical formula may be used to approximate the largest cumulative number of infections which will be applied below in predicting the covid-19 evolution outside of china where the coronavirus infection has not yet reached its peak number of cases different countries are applying different modes for slow the covid-19 spread in the next sub-sections we discuss several representative countries and then fitpredict the virus spread there to  to decrease the acceleration of covid-19 spread italys mode is now similar to china lockdown of the full population the predicted covid-19 spread in italy is plotted in figure 6a  although italy has followed chinas mode of national isolation the number of infected people increased rapidly from 3142020 to 3192020 495 new cases per day to account for the delayed national quarantine compared with china we decrease the c index when also increasing the upper limit of the cumulative infection the covid-19 evolution prediction results show that there may be a turning point in the next two weeks when the current infected cases begin to decline we also separate the death toll from the number of recovered cases south koreas mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is fast detection and tracking of the disease south korea is using efficient mobile diagnoses tests and accurate tracing of infected cases to maintain a low death rate even with a large infected population the mobile method can test 20000 people per day the maximum capability on 3122020 and apps for cell phones andor credit cards can accurately track the routes of infected people with the help of local government without invasion of privacy so that warnings can be immediately delivered to the general population to obviate the places with high risk the current infected population may have passed 13 its peak number of cases around 3202020 and the prediction shows that the covid-19 outbreak may be well controlled in 35 days from 3222020 figure 6b  japans mode of combating the spread of covid-19 is compatible with that of the us in addition to other changes such as enhanced educationoutreach and fast treatment to the infected cases specific policies include social distancing which might be a key barrier to the spread of the novel coronavirus personal hygiene and quarantine of the infected cases the current data and modeling results figure 6c show that japan has an efficient way so far to limit the maximum population infected and slow the spread of covid-19 while this outbreak may last for a while the model-predicted covid-19 spread in us using the fitted infection and recovery rates from china  figure 5  reveals the impact of one possible mitigation scenario for covid-19 state coronavirus lockdowns which have now been implemented by some states in the us such as california and new york other non-pharmaceutical options can and should also be evaluated using mathematical models considering the recent surge of infected cases in the us when the number of infected persons is initially small compared to that of susceptible people the infected and susceptible people are not well mixed and hence the system is not homogeneous under such conditions a stochastic model is needed as the deterministic continuum models such as the seir model assume well-mixing of components for a homogeneous system 21 22  hence this section develops and applies a stochastic model to evaluate the non-pharmaceutical scenarios for mitigating covid-19 with a small number of initial infections the random walk based stochastic model for covid-19 spread is analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction-based mechanismcondition 23  when a reactant a particle 14 representing a susceptible individual a meets a reactant b particle representing an infectious person b a chemical reaction may occur if the collision energy is large enough to break the chemical bond meaning that the susceptible person a may be infected if satisfying additional criteria such as a and b are close enough and b touches hisher face after receiving coronavirus from a therefore the condition of a being infected is not deterministic but rather a random probability-controlled process this probability is related to various factors such as the duration that a and b are in contact the infectivity rate and the distance between the two people which may be characterized parsimoniously by the interaction radius r that controls the number of reactant pairs susceptible  infectious in a potential reaction infection 23  hence the core of the random walk stochastic model for covid-19 spread is to define the interaction radius r the analogous development and similarities between bimolecular reactions and the sir model can also be seen from their governing equations the time-dependent sir model takes the form 24  where   and   denote the transmission rate and recovery rate at time t respectively therefore following the argument in zhang et al 23 and lu et al 25  we derive analytically the interaction radius r for the sir model 4 where v denotes the volume of the domain  is the time step in random walk particle tracking     is the mass or weight carried by each a particle   is the initial concentration of a which can be assumed to be the normalized value 1 here and denotes the initial number of susceptible people after defining the interaction radius r the particle tracking scheme proposed by zhang et al 23 and lu et al 25 can be applied to model the transmission of coronavirus between the susceptible and infectious people in addition to pharmaceutical strategies including vaccine and therapeutic drug development and herd immunity that may either take a while or have a high risk non-pharmaceutical scenarios can be tested several particle-tracking based stochastic models were proposed recently 26 to evaluate non-pharmaceutical scenarios to mitigate coronavirus spreading in a city here we evaluate three related scenarios described below using the stochastic model proposed above scenario 1 no special constraints assuming a city with 10000 people and 4 initial coronavirus cases this scenario does not put any constraints for any population we assume that 16 the population distributes in the city randomly at the beginning and then moves randomly the spread of covid-19 is then simulated using the stochastic model proposed in section 41 scenario 2 social distancing this scenario assumes that all people in the city maintain a social distance significantly decreasing the probability of infection scenario 3 attempted quarantine this scenario creates a forced quarantine for infected individuals before the outbreak which is expected to be the most efficient way of quarantine in the stochastic model we assume that 10 days after being infected the person will be removed because of being cured or expired dead this is because the median disease incubation period was estimated to be 51 days 27  for simplicity purposes the interaction radius r 6 remains constant since the constant interaction radius was found to be able to efficiently capture the temporal variation of effective reaction rates in mixing controlled reactions 23 25  the initial number of a and particles is 10000 and 4 respectively the lagrangian solutions of the covid-19 outbreak for the three scenarios are depicted in figure 7  scenarios 1 2 and 3 have a peak in the curve of newly infected people at time t28 65 and 32 respectively showing that the virus spreads the fastest for the scenario without mitigation constraints ie scenario 1 where the number of the total infected increases by one order of magnitude every 10 days in the rising limb as expected however the value for this peak scenario 1 198 people is lower than that for scenario 3 267 people although the total number of the infected people for scenario 1 9336 is slightly larger than scenario 3 9322 this may be due to a greater separation of infection cases for the higher number of initial coronavirus carriers in scenario 1 which causes a lower and relatively flatter covid-19 evolution peak than scenario 3 scenario 2 has the lowest peak value 121 people and the most-delayed peak in the curve of new cases and the total infection time is almost doubled compared to the other two 17 scenarios indicating that people living with strict social distancing may also suffer from a much longer period of covid-19 threat it is also noteworthy that the overall trend of the solution of scenario 1 initial surge without special constraints figure 7a  is similar to that for italy which had delayed response to the covid-19 outbreak initially figure 6a  and scenario 3 solution a lower peak value and a longer duration due to social distancing figure 7b  is similar to that for japan which has been taken social distancing actions figure 6c  the simulated particle plumes plotted in figure 8 reveal the subtle discrepancy between the three mitigation scenarios scenario 1 assumes that four initial cases were initially located on the right side of the city while the whole population 10000 susceptible persons was distributed randomly in the 11 domain  figure 8a  the trajectory of each person is assumed to follow two-dimensional brownian motion with retention to capture the random vector for each displacement and the random waiting time between two consecutive motions the virus moved quickly from east to west figures 8b and 8c  spreading over the whole city before all the infected people were cured or expired dead at time t69 figures 8d  a total of 664 susceptible people 66 of the total population distributed randomly around the city were never infected scenario 2 assumes that social distancing can reduce the infection probability which can be characterized by a smaller reaction rate or a smaller interaction radius in our lagrangian approach figure 8i can still cause the spread of coronavirus figures 8j8l  self-quarantine therefore may not be as effective as maintained social distancing the covid-19 pandemic radically impacts our lives altering our daily patterns and interactions in an unprecedented way and rate in this study the transmissioninfection and   analysis on novel coronavirus covid-19 using machine learning methods milind yadav murukessan perumal m srinivas   covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus which has first been originated in wuhan city hubei provinces of china 1 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a new type of virus family that has not been earlier identified in people the virus seems to be transmitted mostly through the minute respiratory droplets via coughing sneezing or when people interact with each other for some time in close proximity these droplets can then be inhaled or they can land on surfaces that others may come into touch with who can then get contaminate when they contact their eyes mouth or nose the novel coronavirus can live on different surface like few days stainless steel and plastic and few hours cardboard and copper however the amount of viable virus declines over time and may not always be present in sufficient numbers to cause infection in humans the symptoms of this virus can be experienced in between 1 to 14 days from the day of infection from then it has been spreading at the speed of knots giving no time to prepare against a newly identified infectious and notorious virus which have compelled the who to declare covid-19 as a pandemic 3 due to its fast human to human transmission and people got infected in every continent and it had already taken so many lives the statistics and graph for increasing cases active cases have been shown in the figure 1
 symptoms of coronavirus change in severity from having no symptoms at all being asymptomatic to having fatigue cough fever general weakness sore throatmuscular pain and in the most extreme cases sepsis severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndromeand septic shock all potentially leading to death reports show that clinical deterioration can occur quickly often during the 14 days of disease of late anosmia loss of the sense of smell have been reported as a one of the symptom of a coronavirus infection there is already conformation from many regions such as italy china and south korea that patients with committed sars-cov-2 infection have developed anosmiahyposmia in some cases in the absence of any other symptoms still there is no proper treatment drugs or vaccine for coronavirus disease several random drugs are being tried to target the virus on severely affected coronavirus patients however the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomized controlled trials several clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available as this is a new virus no vaccine is currently available although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide it may be months to more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans 5 till today covid-19 has been infected the citizens of more than 212 countries leads to 3747356 patients out of which 258970 people had lost their lives and 1250693 people 6 gets recovered but due to the virus bi-phasic nature there may be chances of infection again in those recovered cases due to an insufficient number of test kits ventilators oxygen tanks hospital beds and unavailability of proper treatment or vaccine it is very important to analyze the growth rates of positive cases number of recoveries and other factors that affect the growth of this virus to the same extent proper arrangements can be made to prevent losses of lives and to have proper insights of the condition for example based on the analysis of data the government can have the prior information to the number of cases till a particular day and before that day they can arrange all the necessary medical equipment or which mitigations to be done to prevent losses of lives nowadays machine learning methods have been widely used in healthcare field 7 8 and for having much faster and efficient prediction of covid-19 infected person in this work the support vector regression svr 9 10 11 model is used to solve the four different types of covid-19 related problems the proposed method will be fitted into the dataset containing the total number of covid19 positive cases and the number of recoveries for different countries like mainland china us italy south korea and india and with the help of the proposed method to predict the future number of total cases active cases and recoveries these tasks can help a countryregion to understand the spreading of the virus facilitateaware people start mitigations itll also help that regioncountry to be prepared for whats will happen in the future which may help in saving lives and agony and compare proposed method results with other well know regression models such as simple linear regression polynomial regression 12 and another task containing the weather data for regions like new york citynyc and milano italy to analyze the correlation between different weather parameters and the total number of cases pearsons method is used this will help in understanding the effects of weather conditions on the virus spread support vector machines svm 15 is a supervised learning algorithm this algorithm is used for classification and regression problems svr is based on the same principles as svm for classification ie to find a hyperplane in a d-dimensional space d is the number of features that uniquely classifies the data points svr uses a non-parametric technique which means the output from the svr model does not depend on distributions of the dependent and independent variables svr technique is basically dependent on kernel functions which allows for the construction of a non-linear model without changing the explanatory variables which helps in better interpretation of the resultant model in these algorithms a hyperplane is found that separates the different features the produced model by svm does not depend on the training points that lie outside the margin but instead depends on a subset of the training data as the cost function similarly in svr support vectors find the closest data points and the actual function represented by them we get closest to the actual curve if the distance between the support vectors to the regressed curve is maximum a hyperplane is a function that classifies the points in a higher dimension or other words hyperplanes are the boundaries that help in the classification of the data points if the margin for any hyperplane is maximum then that hyperplane is the optimal hyperplane the points which are closest to hyperplane are called support vector points and the distance of the vectors from the hyperplane are called the margins as shown in figure 2
 farther the support vector points from the hyperplane more is the probability that the points will be correctively classified in their respective region or classes thus the equation of the hyperplane in the d dimension can be given as1zl011x1l2x2l3x3l0i1nlixil0l1txbl1txwhere lil0l1l2

0 and x  variables kernel is an important part of svr the kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors x and y in some high dimensional feature space kernel trick is used in svr which simply means to replace the dot product of two vectors by the kernel function the outbreak of covid-19 is developing into a major international crisis and its starting to influence important aspects of daily life for example bans have been placed on hotspot countries international manufacturing operations have often had to throttle back production and many goods solely produced in china have been halted altogether in highly affected areas people are starting to stock up on essential goods such that in order to predict how the virus could spread across different countries and regions different regression models were to be used to predict the total number of positive cases the main goal of this task was to build and compare regression models that can predict the progression of the total positive covid 19 cases from different regions that may help mitigation efforts the advantage of doing this would be that we will have an idea about the number that will reach of many cases this will give the idea about the level of spread and in accordance to that the government and the citizens can make proper plans to handle the situation by taking measures to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation and other necessary actions predicting total number of cases in different regions are show in figure 3

has yet been discovered it is important to see how many of the patients will recover from this virus and how and when the epidemic will end the main objective of this task was to predict how many people were going to recover based on old recovery records such that in order to predict how many people will actually recover records for the number of recovered patients across different countries were taken the goal of solving this task helps us to understand how the epidemic will end ie how many patients will recover the advantage of doing this would be that we will have an idea about the

covid-19 causes illness in humans and creates severe damage in the lungs however covid-19 has killed many people in the entire world in this paper we are proposing the support vector regression method based navel coronavirus analysis on five different tasks main novelty in this work is instead of simple regression line we use supported vectors also to get better classification accuracy the main advantage of doing the first task would be that this will give the idea about the level of spread and in accordance to that the government and the citizens can make proper plans to handle the situation by taking measures to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation and other necessary actions with the help of second task will have an idea about how well the mitigations are working and the actions that are taken till date how effective are they or how many cases have been prevented by this the advantage of doing third task would be that we will have an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection from the older known methods since no vaccine or cure is yet discovered and by predicting the time that will be taken by all the patients to recover we will be able to understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to end with fourth task we will be able to observe and analyze how fast or slow the virus is spreading among regions therefore which areas needs more attention or not finally fifth task create better surroundings for the infected patient to reduce the spread the people can also be warned if they should avoid humidity or not and high temperature or no pearsons correlation method gives a clear understanding of the correlation between the spread and weather conditions in all tasks the proposed support vector

 an independent experimental trial consisted of seeding the seven test organisms into 20 l dechlorinated tap water from a groundwater source and pumping the seeded water by peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1 l min1 from carboys through a glass wool filter the bacteria test organisms were not included in every trial all tubing and containers had previously been disinfected with 05  chlorine for at least 30 min followed by chlorine neutralization with 005 mol l1 na2s2o3 and rinsed with sterile 18 mohm water three water turbidity levels were evaluated these were prepared by mixing into the 20-l test water volumes dried agricultural soil surface horizon of withee silt loam at 0 g l1 05 ntu 127 g l1 215 ntu and 275 g l1 447 ntu ambient water ph was 76 and all samples were adjusted to ph 70 before glass wool filtration by the addition of 1 mol l1 hcl a 10 m nominal pore size polypropylene prefilter macmaster-carr elmhurst il was used for 215 ntu and 447 ntu water matrices to prevent clogging of the glass wool filter glass wool filters were eluted in the direction opposite to the original flow with two 80 ml elutions of 3  beef extract-glycine buffer beg at ph 95 goyal and gerba 1980 the first eluent was allowed to soak the filter for 15 min before adding the second eluent which was immediately pushed through the filter by air eluates containing suspended sediments were centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min and the solution was saved the soil pellet was resuspended in beg ph 95 and centrifuged again at 1000g for 5 min the solutions were added to the original eluate and adjusted to ph 7075 with 1 mol l1 hcl and then flocculated by the addition of polyethylene glycol 8000 8  wt vol1 and nacl final concentration 02 mol l1 this mixture was stirred for 1 h at 4 c incubated overnight at 4 c and centrifuged at 4200g for 45 min at 4 c the pellet was resuspended in sterile 015 mol l1na2hpo4 solution ph 70 prefilters were placed into a plastic bag with 200 ml beg ph 95 massaged and soaked for 15 min and the eluate poured off and further concentrated as described for the glass wool filter eluates these final concentrated sample volumes fcsv from both the glass wool filter and prefilter were then assayed separately and the results summed to obtain the recovered quantity of test organism 
campylobacter jejuni was enumerated by spreading 100 l of serial tenfold dilutions of fcsv on duplicate plates of cva agar remel lenexa ks and counting the appropriate colony forming units escherichia coli o157nm and viruses were enumerated by quantification of the genomic copies using qpcr and two step rt-qpcr respectively and interpolation from the standard curves created for each organism type rt-qpcr inhibition was evaluated by hepatitis g virus hgv armored rna asuragen inc austin tx these methods were identical to those described in lambertini et al 2008 except amplification of cdna occurred in a 96-well microplate using the roche lightcycler 480 system roche diagnostics mannheim germany the lightcycler probes master kit roche diagnostics was used to prepare the pcr mixes table 2 lists the final concentrations and sequences of the primers integrated dna technologies coralville iowa and taqman probes tib molbiol berlin germany for each pathogen amplification conditions started with a hot start polymerase activation step for 10 min at 95 c followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 c and 1 min at 60 c
 a 20 l negative control unseeded water sample was processed for each trial no background pathogens were detected at any time in the water or soil-amended water samples in addition for each recovery trial an unseeded 20-l water sample was passed through a glass wool filter eluted and the resulting negative eluate then seeded with the same concentration of pathogens as the corresponding water sample pathogens in the seeded negative eluate were enumerated with the same method as the water samples and these values were used as the devisors when calculating percent recovery quantifying the seeded pathogens in a negative eluate takes into consideration differences in pathogen enumeration that could result from matrix differences created by the glass wool filter the importance of this step when quantifying pathogens by qpcr is discussed in lambertini et al 2008 and borchardt et al 2013 percent recovery was calculated as the number of genomic copies or cfus of the test organism recovered after filtration of the water sample divided by the number of genomic copies or cfus of the test organism seeded into the eluate of the unseeded water sample multiplied by 100 glass wool filters were effective in concentrating pathogens in water with a wide range of turbidity levels mean recovery efficiencies and standard deviations by turbidity level and by pathogen type are reported in table 1 recoveries across the three water matrices ranged from 221 to 727  for the bacteria and 92 to 702  for the viruses bacteria had higher recoveries than the viruses and among the viruses poliovirus had the highest recovery among nine independent recovery experiments non-detects ie no recovery were observed for bvdv type 1 and bvdv type 2 once each at 05 ntu turbidity three times for bvdv 1 and twice for bvdv 2 at 215 ntu turbidity and twice for bvdv 2 at 447 ntu turbidity these non-detects were assigned a zero value and included in the mean recovery calculation all other seeded test organisms were recovered every time an experiment was performed percent recoveries the outcome measure for each pathogen type and turbidity level were tested for normality outliers and homogeneity of variance the tests indicated that the data were not normally distributed outliers were present in the datasets and the datasets have significantly different variances the datasets were transformed using the arcsine trigonometric function to attain normality to fulfill the requirements for conducting a classical analysis of variance anova however even after transformation the same tests showed none of the requirements were met alternatively we applied bootstrapping techniques for conducting the anova mooney and duval 1993 with at least 5000 iterations where recovery percent was the dependent variable and pathogen type and turbidity level were the independent variables table 1 shows the p value for each of the bootstrapping anova tests with the region for rejecting the null hypothesis set at 5  the null hypothesis stated there is no significance difference between the means of percent recoveries for the different pathogen types under the three turbidity levels comparing within a turbidity level percent recoveries were significantly different among pathogen types at 05 ntu and 215 ntu whereas at the 447 ntu turbidity level the difference in recoveries among pathogens was minor table 1 this suggests when turbidity is high the interaction of soil particles with the filter masks the differences in adsorption and size exclusion characteristics of the pathogens that normally results in differences in filter retention comparing within a pathogen type turbidity did not affect recovery except for campylobacter seeded at 500 cfu l1 table 1 p value  00005 for the other pathogens namely bovine coronavirus bovine rotavirus a bvdv type 1 bvdv type 2 e coli o157nm poliovirus and campylobacter seeded at 5 cfu l1 turbidity did not affect recovery as indicated by anova p values of 022 1 056 032 068 037 and 069 respectively it appears that for most of the pathogen types and concentrations tested factors other than turbidity level are more important in determining recovery efficiency by glass wool filtration aggregating recovery data across turbidity levels and examining all pairwise comparisons between pathogen types percent recoveries differed among virus types and between bacteria and viruses but not between bacterial species table 3 however these comparisons need to be interpreted cautiously because a key limitation of the present study is the quantity of pathogen seeded varied with pathogen type not allowing a clear separation between the effects of seed quantity and pathogen type on percent recovery previously lambertini et al 2008 showed glass wool filter recovery efficiencies did differ among species and serotypes of human enteric viruses but not by the quantity of viruses seeded
 among pathogen types poliovirus 579  and e coli o157nm 548  had the greatest recovery efficiency while bvdv-1 156  had the lowest table 3 simultaneous concentration of waterborne bacteria and viruses has been previously reported using filtration payment et al 1989 ultrafiltration hill et al 2005 liu et al 2012 and continuous flow ultracentrifugation bisha et al 2011 however these methods often require costly equipment or filters glass wool filters have been used by several groups lambertini et al 2008 environment agency 2000 vilagins et al 1993 to concentrate human enteric viruses from a variety of water sources here we report the use of these filters for concentrating both viral and bacterial pathogens associated with cattle manure from water at turbidity levels simulating agricultural runoff the filters are advantageous in that they are inexpensive highly portable usable in a wide range of water matrices and effective for simultaneous concentration of both bacterial and viral waterborne pathogens they can be constructed to any size depending on volumes to be sampled after disinfection filter housings are reusable glass wool filters however do have limitations as with any virus concentration method that relies on electro-positively charged media for virus adsorption eg 1mds filter cuno inc meriden ct filter effectiveness depends on ambient water ph in our laboratory we have selected ph 75 as the cut-off above which the water ph is adjusted downward by continuously pumping 025 mol l1 hcl into the filter input line during sampling virus recovery measured in the present study compares favorably with values observed in previous glass wool validation studies with human viruses the average poliovirus recovery rate across the three water matrices was 58  near the ranges of 6277  and 6083  reported by vilagins et al 1993 1997 7091  range noted in the uk environment agency study environment agency 2000 and 17155  reported by lambertini et al 2008 and 3881  range noted by millen et al 2012 the first three previous studies cited adopted working parameters different from those used here such as filtration rate water source and filter dimensions making direct comparison of recovery efficiencies equivocal it is also important that the virus enumeration techniques used were not identical specifically vilagins et al 1993 and the uk environment agency environment agency 2000 used a plaque assay the studies completed by lambertini et al 2008 and millen et al 2012 used the same filtration and virus enumeration techniques as employed here our recovery data for e coli o157nm and c jejuni as well as the recovery data for salmonella enterica reported in millen et al 2012 demonstrate that the glass wool filtration is an effective for concentrating waterborne bacteria even with c jejuni concentrations as low as five cfu per liter in highly turbid water glass wool filtration recovered about a quarter to a third of the bacteria table 1 payment et al 1989 examined fiberglass filters for the recovery efficiency of clostridium perfringens and legionella pneumophila and found efficiencies were 83 and 55  respectively hill et al 2005 tested ultrafiltration for recoveries of e coli enterococcus faecalis s enterica bacillus globigii and found mean recovery efficiencies were from 70 to 93  for all bacterial species bisha et al 2011 evaluated modified moore swabs and continuous flow centrifugation for concentrating s enterica and e coli o157h7 liu et al 2012 tested the recovery of c perfringens spores and e coli by ultrafiltration and the recovery efficiencies were greater than 50  having one simple method for concentrating multiple types of waterborne pathogens is advantageous for assessing pathogen levels in water and the associated health risk we demonstrated that inexpensive and easily constructed glass wool filters are effective for concentrating a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in runoff from agricultural fields with applied dairy manure the method is applicable to water quality assessment and source tracking  oseltamivir for coronavirus illness post-hoc exploratory analysis of an open-label pragmatic randomised controlled trial in european primary care from 2016 to 2018 samuel coenen alike van der velden w daniela cianci herman goossens emily bongard benjamin saville r nina gobat muireann de paor margareta ieven theo verheij j christopher butler c   patients infected with the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and suffering from covid-19 are currently being treated with drug combinations that include oseltamivir1 the authors had previously found that adding oseltamivir to usual primary care for influenza-like illness ili accelerates recovery by about 1 day in those with ili and longer in those with key risk factors in the alic4e study a randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness in primary care2 this effect did not appear to be mediated by influenza virus status as determined by polymerase chain reaction pcr results from nasopharyngeal swabs outcomes for patients found positive for coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 had not been analysed separately given the evolving pandemic this study set out to conduct a post-hoc exploratory analysis of the open-label pragmatic alic4e trial data to explore whether adding oseltamivir to usual primary care for patients with ili who have tested positive for coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 is effective in reducing time to recovery this was a post-hoc exploratory analysis of data from the alic4e trial an open-label pragmatic randomised controlled trial previously described in full23 patients aged 1 year presenting to primary care with ili during three seasonal influenza seasons 15 january 2016 to 12 april 2018 in 15 european countries randomised in the alic4e trial and infected with coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 were eligible for this study ili was defined as a sudden onset of self-reported fever with 1 respiratory symptom cough sore throat running or congested nose and one systemic symptom headache muscle ache sweats or chills or tiredness with symptom duration of 72 hours during a seasonal influenza epidemic4 coronavirus infection was confirmed using the fast track diagnostics respiratory pathogens 21 plus real-time pcr assay on baseline swabs5 an oropharyngeal and nasal swab copan were taken from those aged 16 years and a nasopharyngeal swab copan from those aged 16 years pcr results were not available for clinicians to inform management participants were randomised at the point of care using a remote online electronic data capture system with a 11 ratio between the two arms participants were randomised to either usual primary care or usual primary care plus oseltamivir adults and children weighing 40 kg who were randomised to the intervention and able to swallow capsules were given 75 mg oral oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days for those aged 13 years oseltamivir was given in oral suspension according to weight 30 mg for those weighing 1015 kg 45 mg for those weighing 1523 kg 60 mg for those weighing 2340 kg and 75 mg for those weighing 40 kg a baseline case report form was completed covering overall clinician-rated ili severity duration of symptoms comorbidity temperature pulse individual ili symptom patient-reported severities and usual care advice registered by clinician patients were asked to complete a symptom diary for 14 days in order to indicate when they had returned to their usual daily activities and to evaluate fever runningcongested nose sore throat headache cough shortness of breath muscle ache sweatschills diarrhoea nauseavomiting abdominal pain low energytiredness sleeplessness dizziness and feeling generally unwell as no minor moderate or major problem these were supplemented with child-specific questions so that the canadian acute respiratory illness flu scale was completed for children aged 13 years6 patients were contacted via telephone after 24 days 1428 days and 28 days to support study participation diary completion monitor intervention adherence and to ascertain a minimal outcome data set the primary outcome was patient-reported time to recovery defined as having returned to usual daily activity and fever headache and muscle ache rated as minor or not problematic for non-verbal children clinginess replaced headache and muscle ache when both were unanswered3 where diary data were unavailable data from the 1428 days telephone call were used and if that was unavailable data from the telephone call after 28 days were used where data were incomplete participants were censored at their last contact date or at 28 days characteristics of the participants with coronavirus infection in the two study arms are presented for this exploratory data analysis the authors produced the kaplan meier survival curves for each treatment group and estimated the hazard ratio hr 95 confidence interval ci and associated p-value comparing treatment groups with a cox proportional hazard regression model the analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat itt population which included all randomised patients in the arm they were assigned regardless of treatment received missing data were not imputed coronaviruses cov-229e cov-oc43 cov-ku1 and cov-nl63 which are known pathogens in humans were identified in 308 9 of 3266 randomised participants from 21 networks covering 209 primary care practices in 15 european countries over three consecutive influenza seasons of these identified cases 130 were male 42 and 17 were aged 65 years 6 153 were randomised to usual care and 155 were randomised to usual care plus oseltamivir the primary outcome was ascertained in 136 89 and 147 95 participants respectively figure 1 demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the randomisation groups table 1 the 25 patients who did not provide primary outcome data were more often male aged 12 years 20 80 more often included in the final season and more often had a chronic respiratory condition see supplementary table s1 the kaplanmeier plots for time to recovery show faster recovery in patients treated with oseltamivir figure 2 with a median of 5 interquartile range iqr 38 days for participants randomised to usual care versus 4 days iqr 36 in participants randomised to usual care plus oseltamivir the mean number of days to recovery for patients was 635 days standard deviation sd  493 in the usual care group and 520 sd  393 days in the oseltamivir group the hr was 131 95 ci  103 to 166 p  0026 favouring oseltamivir in the usual care group 54 patients contacted their gp 70 contacts versus 57 patients in the oseltamivir group 72 contacts in the first week after inclusion in the second week after inclusion 17 patients in the usual care group contacted their gp 21 contacts versus 14 patients in the oseltamivir group 16 contacts data not shown in the usual care group seven patients visited the hospital in the 4 weeks after inclusion of which one stayed overnight two had an x-ray with one confirmed pneumonia in the oseltamivir group one patient visited the hospital none stayed overnight and none had an x-ray data not shown this exploratory analysis of the alic4e trial data from 2016 to 2018 suggests that primary care patients with ili who tested positive for coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 and received usual care returned to their usual activities with relevant residual symptoms minor or absent in a median of 5 days mean 635 days patients also receiving oseltamivir returned about 1 day sooner the present pragmatic open trial design did not allow identification of mechanisms of action or a measure of how much of the observed effect can be attributed specifically to oseltamivir or other possible effects but allows the observed results to likely reflect real world effects in primary care78 it should be noted that this was a primary care study and that the findings cannot be extrapolated to more severely ill andor hospitalised patients in addition though unlikely sars-cov-2 may respond differently to oseltamivir this studys findings are consistent with other studies showing benefit of oseltamivir in all patients with ili2 and with previous placebo-controlled evidence for adults and children with ili irrespective of infection by influenza or another virus912 previously published possible explanations include that oseltamivirs mode of action may include generalised non-specific mechanisms andor an action on a wider range of viruses10 or that a placebo effect was found in the present study however in the alic4e trial there was no evidence of a differential relative benefit in subgroups such as those with lower illness severity where systematic reviews suggest a more marked placebo response13 in addition the alic4e trials overall estimate of benefit is similar to effects found in placebo-controlled trials secondary analysis of data from the placebo-controlled trials of oseltamivir in patients with ili not caused by influenza viruses for example by coronaviruses and new placebo-controlled trials in patients with covid-19 could help elucidate a causal effect for its benefit in those patients meanwhile adding oseltamivir to usual primary care appears to accelerate recovery by about 1 day in patients with ili who test positive for coronavirus not including sars-cov-2 and though the present study has not proven that sars-cov-2 responds to oseltamivir this drug could be considered for the management of primary care patients with suspected covid-19  the role of vitamin d in the age of covid-19 a

still no specific approach for prevention and treatment against the coronavirus disease 2019  evidence recommends that vitamin d might be an important supportive agent for the immune system mainly in cytokine response regulation against covid-19 hence we carried out a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis along with an ecological investigation in order to maximize the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin d in the covid-19 methods a systematic search was performed in pubmed scopus embase cochrane library web of science and google scholar intitle as well as preprint database of medrxiv biorxiv research square preprintsorg search engine of sciencedirect and a rapid search through famous journals up to may 26 2020 studies focused on the role of vitamin d in confirmed covid-19 patients were entered into the systematic review along with our main aim to find the second objective correlation of global vitamin d status and covid-19 recovery and mortality we carried out a literature search in pubmed database to identify the national or regional studies reported the vitamin d status globally cma v 22064 and spss v16 were used for data analysis out of nine studies entered into our systematic review six studies containing 3822 participants entered into the meta-analysis the meta-analysis indicated that 465 of covid-19 patients were suffering from vitamin d deficiency 95 ci 282-658 and in 433 of patients levels of vitamin d were insufficient 95 ci 274-608 in regard to our ecological investigation on 51 countries including 408748 participants analyses indicated no correlation between vitamin d levels and recovery rate r 0041 as well as mortality rate r-0073 globally however given latitude a small reverse correlation between mortality rate and vitamin d status was observed throughout the globe r -0177 in asia a medium direct correlation was observed for recovery rate r 0317 and a significant reveres correlation for mortality rate r -0700 with vitamin d status in such patients in europe there were no correlations for both recovery r 0040 and mortality rate r -0035 in middle east the recovery rate r 0267 and mortality rate r -0217 showed a medium correlation in north and sought america surprisingly both recovery and mortality rate demonstrated a direct correlation respectively r 1000 r0500 in oceania unexpectedly recovery r -1000 and mortality r -1000 rates were in considerable reverse correlation with vitamin d levels in this systematic review and meta-analysis with an ecological approach we found a high percentage of covid-19 patients who suffer from vitamin d deficiency or insufficiency much more important our ecological investigation resulted in substantial direct and reverse correlations between recovery and mortality rates of covid-19 patients with vitamin d status in different countries considering latitudes a small reverse correlation between vitamin d status and mortality rate was found globally it seems that populations with lower levels of vitamin d might be more susceptible to the novel coronavirus infection nevertheless due to multiple limitations if this study does not allow to quantify a value of the vitamin d with full confidence it allows at least to know what the vitamin d might be and that it would be prudent to invest in this direction through comprehensive large randomized clinical trials  following emerge of a novel coronavirus from wuhan china in december 2019 the respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has affected the whole world and declared as a pandemic by world health organization who on march 26 2020 1  according to worldometer metrics this novel virus has been responsible for approximately 6615298 infections of which 3 195 971 cases are recovered and 388759 cases were died worldwide up to june 4 2020 after months of efforts by the medical communities there is still no specific approach for prevention and treatment against the coronavirus disease 2019  also competition of pandemic with infodemic has led to many controversies and challenges globally in this regard one of the hottest topics these days is the role of vitamin d in prevention or treatment of covid-19 several functions such as modulating adaptive immune system and cell-mediated immunity as well as increase of antioxidative-related genes expression have been proven for vitamin d as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections 2 3  according to available investigations it seems that such functions lead to cytokine storm suppression and avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which has been studied on other pandemics and infectious diseases in recent years 4 5 6  to best of our knowledge unfortunately after several months there is no adequate high-quality data on different treatments regimen which raises questions about gaps in scientific works in this occasion when there is an essential need for controlled randomized trials it is surprising to see only observational studies without a control group or non-randomized controlled studies with retrospective nature covering a small number of patients the same issue is debatable for 25-hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd hence concerning all of the limitations and analyze difficulties we carried out a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis with great caution and sensitivity in order to try for maximizing the use of everything that exists about the role of this vitamin in the covid-19 additionally along with this systematic review we also performed an ecological evaluation to find any relations between global status of vitamin d and covid-19 recoverymortality rates to be honest we know that working on observational studies give an overestimation of the required value therefore whatever the result with the vitamin d we can present that the result by our approaches is also an overestimation of reality which is very fascinating in itself to get in the current situation especially through what we found in our ecological approach the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guideline was considered for study plan a systematic search

included all mesh terms and free keywords found for covid-19 sars-cov-2 and vitamin d there was no timelocation language limitation in this search four researchers have screened and selected the papers independently and the supervisor solved the disagreements studies met the following criteria included into meta-analysis 1 comparative or non-comparative studies with retrospective or prospective nature and 2 studies reported the role of vitamin d in confirmed covid-19 patients studies were excluded if they were 1 in vitro studies experimental studies reviews 2 duplicate

extraction checklist included the name of the first author publication year region of study number of patients comorbidity vitamin d status serum 25-hydrovitamin d levels ethnicity mean age medication dosage treatment duration adverse effects radiological results and mortality the modified newcastle-ottawa scale nos checklist for cross-sectional studies was used to value the studies concerning various aspects of the methodology and study process according to risk factors such as older age male obesity underlying chronic disorders higher latitudes darker skin pigmentation etc which are common between vitamin d deficiency and covid-19 toward the severity of the condition despite the various possible explanations we hypothesize that vitamin d plays a role in severity of responses to covid-19 and vitamin d deficiency can be in correlation with covid-19 mortality rate and recovery rate in this regard alongside with our main objective to find the second aim as an ecological investigation we carried out a literature search in pubmed database for identifying the national or regional studies reported the vitamin d status throughout the world data of infection mortality and recovery of covid-19 cases were gathered from the worldometer metrics the meta-analysis was done between all of the published studies in each region for pooling vitamin d mean levels in this case according to an international conference on controversies in vitamin d 7  vitamin d cut-off points were considered as follows  i-square i 2  statistic was used for heterogeneity evaluation following cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions 8  the i 2 was interpreted as follows 0 to 40 might not be important 30 to 60 may represent moderate heterogeneity 50 to 90 may represent substantial heterogeneity 75 to 100 considerable heterogeneity the importance of the observed value of i 2 depends on i magnitude and direction of effects and ii strength of evidence for heterogeneity eg p-value from the chi-squared test or a confidence interval for i 2  thus random-effects model was used for pooling the outcomes in case of heterogeneity otherwise the inverse variance fixed-effect model was used forest plots were presented to visualize the degree of variation between studies meta-analysis was performed using comprehensive meta-analysis cma v 22064 software pooling of effect sizes was done with 95 confident interval ci fixedrandomeffects model was used according to heterogeneities in case of zero frequency the correction value of 01 was used correlation of mortality and

between vitamin d levels and recovery rate r 0041 as well as mortality rate r-0073 globally in detail in asia with overall mean levels of 57326 25ohd 95 ci 56959-57693 a substantial direct correlation was observed between vitamin d status and recovery rate r 0317 as well as a significant reverse correlation for the mortality rate r -0700 in europe there were no correlations for both recovery r 0040 and mortality rate r -0035 in middle east although there was a direct correlation between recovery rate and vitamin d status r 0267 also mortality rate was mediumly in reverse correlation with vitamin d status r -0217 in north america surprisingly both recovery r 1000 and mortality rates r 1000 were highly correlated to the vitamin d levels in sought america both recovery rate r0500 and mortality rate r0500 were in a significant direct correlation with 25ohd levels in oceania unexpectedly recovery r -1000 and mortality r -1000 rates were in substantial reverse correlation with 25ohd levels considering latitude factor as an adjustment for countries in latitudes higher than 50 partial correlation analysis showed a small reverse correlation between mortality rate and vitamin d status throughout the globe r -0177 but no correlation was observed for recovery rate r -0072 this analysis showed a direct correlation in case of mortality rate in europe r 0164  although comparing global statistics of covid-19 outcomes is difficult it is clear that the mortality rate is higher in several countries it seems that various factors such as age healthcare system quality general health status socioeconomic status etc nonetheless one of the underestimated factors which might be associated with covid-19 outcome is the vitamin d status in every populations investigations on respiratory infections indicated that 25hydroxyvitamin d can effectively induce the host defense peptides against bacterial or viral agents and vitamin d insufficiencydeficiency can lead to non-communicable as well as infectious diseases 2 94 95  the other potential role of vitamin d is reduction of inflammatory induced following sars-cov-2 infection in fact vitamin d affects the renin-angiotensin system pathway and promotes the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which downregulates by sars-cov-2 96  concerning all of the limitations and no adequate high-quality data about relation of vitamin d status and covid-19 after several months we have conducted this systematic review and metaanalysis in order to maximize the use of every available data which would give us an overview toward further studies like what we have done recently on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients 97  which have underestimated first but the value was revealed after a while we also hypothesize that vitamin d deficiency can be in correlation with covid-19 mortality rates and recovery rate which has studied through an ecological strategy unfortunately there were no clinical trials and high-quality data regarding the role of vitamin d in covid-19 according to available data entered into our meta-analysis we could only find that approximately half of the patients infected with sars-cov-2 were suffering from vitamin d deficiency and this vitamin was insufficient in about 43 of them in case of relation between vitamin d levels and mortalityrecovery rate of covid-19 patients some researchers were reported the dependence of covid-19 morbidity and mortality to the latitude 99 100  similarly our hypothetical strategy and big data analysis resulted several direct and reverse correlations in this regard a quick look at the fig 5 shows that there is no regular relation for mortality or recovery rate by increasing vitamin d levels but significant fluctuations observe regarding each country despite the fluctuation considering latitudes showed a small reverse correlation between vitamin d status and mortality rate worldwide which indicates that populations with lower levels of vitamin d might be in higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection however focusing on continents and countries one by one indicates interesting findings in this case for example vitamin d status in asia middle east africa and oceania is correlated to the mortality reversely whereas it is in direct correlation with mortality in both north and sought america this might attract the considerations to the racial and ethnic aspects of the subject in different regions and populations 101 102  in case of recovery rate while most of the continents indicated a direct correlation with vitamin d status africa and oceania are significantly showed a reverse correlation in this regard considering table 2  in africa the highest mean levels of vitamin d is related to guinea-bissau and tanzania this finding might be due to the numerous challenges such as human resource health care systems budgetary poor management etc in such regions 103 104 105  which unavoidably affects the subject significantly about oceania it seems that extremely high rate of recovery in both australia and new zealand led to this statistical outcome ultimately to best of our knowledge this is the most comprehensive systematic review that carried out a meta-analysis for investigating the role of vitamin d in covid-19 patients along with a wide ecological consideration however after releasing outcomes of underway mentioned rcts an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on this subject could be more conclusive and reliable it is worth noticing that the current meta-analysis includes the following limitations1 studies entered into the meta-analysis were observational and cross-sectional thus comparative analyses were not applicable in first part of study 2 there are inevitable challenges with reliability of data due to different strategies in testing eg vitamin d measurement covid-19 test etc various subpopulations etc in both first part and ecological part of study 3 other immunomodulator factors eg vitamin c zinc selenium etc which might be effective in the outcome of covid-19 patients have not considered in included studies and 4 type ii statistical errors following studies with small sample size eventually to overcome the limitations and bias results of the study should be confirmed by robustly large multicentral randomized clinical trials the conditional evidence recommends that vitamin d might be an important supportive agent for the immune system mainly in cytokine response regulation against pathogens in this systematic review and meta-analysis along with an ecological approach we found a high percentage of covid-19 patients who suffer from vitamin d deficiency or insufficiency more importantly our ecological investigation resulted in substantial direct and reverse correlations between recovery and mortality rate of covid-19 patients with vitamin d status respectively in different countries considering latitudes a small reverse correlation between vitamin d status and mortality rate was found throughout the world altogether it seems that populations with lower levels of vitamin d might be in higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection however further large clinical trials following comprehensive meta-analysis should be taken into account in order to achieve more reliable findings additionally due to multiple limitations if this study does not allow to quantify a value of the   making waves coronavirus detection presence and persistence in the water environment state of the art and knowledge needs for public health carducci annalaura federigi ileana liu dasheng thompson julian r verani marco   the appearance of new viruses with a high epidemic potential is often the result of complex dynamics involving animals humans and the environment coker et al 2011 coronavirus can be considered as a paradigm of this phenomenon in the last 18 years it has caused three new alarming diseases severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the current coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 who 2020a the family of coronaviridae includes strains that infect humans with a wide range of clinical symptoms from those associated with the common cold to potentially lethal respiratory syndromes other coronaviridae strains infect birds and mammals ictv 2012 the high variability of this virus makes cross-infections among species possible potentially leading to spillover chan et al 2015 in fact before the outbreak of the current virus a number of authors addressing the environmental circulation of viruses had already highlighted the potential new pandemic threat posed by coronavirus wigginton and ellenberg 2015

morse et al 2012

santos and monteiro 2013 although the main route of transmission of these viruses is via droplets and close contacts the possible environmental spread via water bioaerosols and food should not be neglected in fact the fecal elimination of coronavirus is well-known and has been confirmed for sars-cov yam et al 2003 poon et al 2004 wang et al 2005a petrich et al 2006 he et al 2007 mers cov drosten et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 and sars-cov-2 holshue et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the potential fecal-oral transmission was recently highlighted by yeo et al 2020 moreover possible transmission through bioaerosols from toilet flushing was demonstrated in hong kong for the sars epidemic cluster in amoy gardens watts 2003 yu et al 2004 and was recently suggested for sars-cov-2 ong et al 2020 finally the involvement of fecally-contaminated food in coronavirus transmission is generally not considered but cannot be ruled out given the survival of the human or animal coronavirus on vegetables mullis et al 2013 ypiz-gmez et al 2013 at present covid-19 is responsible for a rapidly expanding global epidemic with tens of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths heymann and shindo 2020 di marco et al 2020 as a result a pandemic was declared by who on march 11 2020 who 2020b it is therefore possible that the virus may be released with wastewater and from there contaminate other water bodies surface sea groundwater generating aerosols in fact sewage from hospitals especially infectious disease units may contain the epidemic virus thus requiring efficient disinfection before discharge into natural waters owing to concerns about sars-cov-2 water pollution north korea has recently started to monitor surface waters used as sources of drinking water as recently announced in newspapers by the korean government-funded news agency byung-joon 2020
on yonhap news agency even though other countries are reassuring the public about the safety of drinking water la rosa et al 2020 the problem of water pollution was also addressed in a technical brief of the who on water sanitation hygiene and waste management for covid-19 march 3 2020 this focused on enteric viruses including coronaviruses and indicates that measures used for the non-enveloped enteric virus abatement should be even more efficient for coronavirus who 2020c nevertheless the brief confirms the lack of knowledge regarding coronavirus in water knowledge of the presence of the coronavirus and more specifically of sars-cov-2 in wastewater along with its survival and removal by different treatment approaches could be very useful for risk assessment and management in order to define the state of the art regarding coronavirus generally and for epidemic strains in the water environment a literature search was conducted on april 20 2020 using three bibliographic databases pubmed scopus and web of science without time limitations to include even the oldest papers the search was performed with the following keywords coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars mers covid-19 associated with water wastewater sewage slurry sludge and biosolids to give a comprehensive view of the topic the literature search was extended to preprints using the medrxiv server httpswwwmedrxivorg with the same criteria cited above papers were screened in relation to the title and abstract in order to eliminate duplicates and to check whether they complied with the aim of the survey the selected papers were read entirely to collect data on coronavirus type and strain type of water sample type of study experimental or field detection methods monitoring data survival data effect of disinfection and treatments the time span covered by the papers identified by the search extended from 1978 to 2020 however the number of specific papers corresponding to the keywords used was very small only 22 of which 4 papers were preprints from medrxiv these papers are reported and summarized in table 1
 with the exception of one study published in 1978 the other papers were published after the sars late 2002early 2003 and mers late 2012 emergencies fig 1
reports the timeline of the reviewed studies divided on the basis of topic nine papers consisted of in vitro studies eleven papers were monitoring studies and two papers included both research aspects the papers were not comparable because they had different purposes and used different methodologies current methods are set up for non-enveloped viruses ie adenovirus norovirus hepatitis a virus which are normally linked to waterborne transmission bosch et al 2008 la rosa et al 2012 coronavirus as well as other enveloped viruses exhibit structural and biochemical properties which suggest that the same methods would not have the same recovery efficiency different methods have therefore been tested on different water samples spiked with different viruses two papers focused on glass wool filtration methods widely used for non-enveloped viruses which consist in an initial phase of adsorption and elution to positively charged glass wool followed by a second phase of precipitation with polyethylene glycol 6000 peg abd-elmaksoud et al 2014 blanco et al 2019 abd-elmaksoud et al 2014 analysed 20 l of dechlorinated tap water with different turbidities spiked with bcov detected with pcr they found highly variable virus recovery rates 181  201 results from the samples with low turbidity reported the highest recovery efficiency 258  213 blanco et al 2019 optimized the glass wool filtration method using 50 l of surface waters spiked with tgev detected with cell cultures by raising the ph of the buffer eluent to 110 at 95 for non-enveloped viruses by increasing the contact time from 10 to 20 min and using a 20 concentration of peg instead of 10 the virus recovery thus improved from 040 to 51  14 although both studies used the same method the results are not directly comparable because the studies differed in terms of coronavirus strain type and volume of water samples quantity of virus seeded and detection method 
wang et al 2005c evaluated a virus concentration method based on the adsorption on electropositive filter media particle columns elution with broth at ph 72 and precipitation by 10 peg they analysed 100-ml of sewage spiked with sars-cov and phage f2 detected with cultural methods and obtained a much higher recovery efficiency for phage f2 on average 1271 ranging from 336 to 2600 than for sars-cov 102 ranging from 0 to 214 
ye et al 2016 applied a two-step method to wastewater samples based on a preliminary centrifugation aimed at removing solid particles and then ultrafiltration on the liquid fraction both solid and liquid parts were analysed with cultural methods small wastewater samples 30-ml were spiked with mhv and phage 6 both enveloped and with phages ms2 and t3 non-enveloped and the method was optimized for both fractions to increase the recovery rates of the enveloped viruses they achieved mean recovery rates of 251 for mhv 182 for 6 556 for ms2 and 855 for t3 thus confirming the lower efficiency of the concentration methods for enveloped viruses in addition although up to 26 of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction compared to 6 of the two non-enveloped ones only 37 of mhv and 2 of ms2 were recovered from it a completely different approach was followed by fan et al 2010 who tested the efficiency of a methodology for virus detection based on surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy sers coupled with statistical analysis methods to interpret the sers spectral pattern they used deionized water spiked with mhv with a very high final concentration 106-107 pfuml the results demonstrated that this methodology was able to differentiate viruses at the strain level however its real usefulness for rapid detection and identification of viruses in environmental water samples was questionable owing to the low sensitivity the small numbers of studies on the detection methods for coronavirus and surrogates in water is likely motivated by the assumption that they are not considered to be waterborne although the results of these studies are not directly comparable they indicate that methods normally used for non-enveloped viruses need to be improved for enveloped viruses and that in any case they have a lower efficiency in the survival studies a variable persistence of viruses was identified depending on the type of virus type of water sample and temperature duan et al 2003 found a reduction in sars-cov infectivity up to an undetectable level after 34 days at room temperature in 300-l of sterilized water initially containing a viral titer of 106 tcid50 the persistence of infective sars-cov was reduced in 2 day at 20 c in all the water types tested by wang et al 2005b namely hospital wastewater domestic sewage and tap water but at 4 c it increased to 14 days which was the duration of the entire study period over a 21-day study period gundy et al 2009 compared the survival of hcov-229e and fivp with that of poliovirus 1 in filtered unfiltered tap water and wastewater in tap water coronavirus showed a 3 log10 decrease in 10 days at 23 c and over a longer period estimated 100 days at 4 c in addition fivp inactivation at 4 c was faster compared to hcov-229e in wastewater only at 23 c both coronaviruses survived for a shorter period 24 days poliovirus survived longer than coronaviruses in all tested water samples at 23 c similar to 4 c in tap water other studies showed a prolonged survival of animal coronavirus and surrogates in different water matrices casanova et al 2009 reported a 2 log10 decline in tgev and mhv infectivity after more than 15 days in reagent-grade water at 25 c the survival was strongly prolonged at 4 c over 49 days no reduction was observed both in reagent-grade and lake water for mhv whilst a 1 log10 reduction after 14 days was observed in lake water for tgev this study also demonstrated a faster decline in infectivity in wastewater in particular a 2 log10 reduction was observed after nine and seven days for tgev and mhv respectively in pasteurized sewage at 2325 c room temperature and 2 log10 and 1 log10 reductions after 35 days at 4 c in a later work casanova and weaver 2015 found a 2 log10 reduction of phage 6 after five days in pasteurized raw sewage at 22 c but with nonlinear inactivation kinetics studying mhv and phage 6 in raw sewage ye et al 2016 compared the virus survival in pasteurized and unpasteurized wastewater while in pasteurized sewage they found a 2 log10 reduction at 25 c after 3040 h for mhv and 50 h for phage 6 in the unpasteurized samples the inactivation time was reduced to 13 and 7 h respectively indicating the possible role of other microorganisms bacteria and protozoa in the viral inactivation the reduction in the enveloped viruses was significantly slower in wastewater at 10 c compared to 25 c in the same study phages ms2 and t3 non-enveloped survived longer in all conditions and matrices although these studies are fragmentary and not directly comparable they indicate that human coronavirus and surrogates are less resistant than non-enveloped viruses in water environments that their survival is generally reduced in waters with organic and microbial pollution and that viral inactivation increases with increasing temperatures several studies have considered the efficacy of disinfection treatments against sars-cov and surrogates on surfaces kampf et al 2020 however water disinfection was only addressed by wang et al 2005b who analysed the resistance to different chlorine solutions of sars-cov and phage f2 seeded into 100-ml domestic sewage during a 30 min disinfection assay sars-cov was completely inactivated with 10 mgl chlorine or 20 mgl chlorine dioxide while phage f2 needed a higher chlorine concentration 40 mgl and was not completely inactivated even by 40 mgl chlorine dioxide 
christensen and myrmel 2018 tested the virus removal efficiency at the bench scale of a coagulation-filtration system previously optimized using three different coagulants zirconium chitosan and polyaluminium chloride in reducing bcov and other viruses hepatis a virus bovine norovirus and ms2 diluted and undiluted water samples 400-ml from water treatment plants were spiked with viral mixtures after the addition of coagulants centrifugation and filtration steps the supernatant and filtrate were analysed for quantification a combination of flocculation and filtration led to a decline in viral presence from 10 to 70 depending on the type of virus coagulant and presence of natural organic matter bcov was reduced more mean 4 log10 in undiluted water by all the three coagulants than in diluted water in this last example chitosan performed the best as of 2019 a total of seven studies had monitored the presence of coronavirus sars and animal in water sewage slurry or biosolids generally as part of a wider project overall their findings are heterogeneous in terms of the goals of the study matrices and detection methods 
derbyshire and brown 1978 analysed different environmental matrices impacted by breeding activities for a total of 158 samples collected from surface runoff surface waters and groundwaters 20-l each as well as slurry from pig and cattle sources 2-l each the study used different virus concentration methods based on the type of environmental matrices and seeded the eluates on primary cell cultures from slurry samples 56 the study found 25 porcine enteroviruses three adenovirus and one coronavirus the analysis of water samples 102 revealed the presence of only three porcine enteroviruses and one bovine enterovirus however no coronavirus was found 
wang et al 2005c analysed a total of 20 sewage samples before 25-l and after 25-l disinfection by chlorine from hospitals receiving sars patients samples were concentrated by electropositive filter media particle the virus recovery was also assessed in the same study see section 32 and the eluates were then analysed for sars-cov using both cell culture and rt-pcr all samples were negative for infectious sars-cov however the genome was detected in all samples before disinfection 100 and in three samples after disinfection 15 
schwarte et al 2011 studied the impact of grazing animals on the microbial and chemical-physical water quality of pasture streams using different simulated scenarios in a rural area bcov together with bovine enterovirus and bovine rotavirus were measured from simulated runoff 360 samples and cow feces 90 samples as viruses are commonly shed by grazing animals the pathogen load was analysed using multiplex rt-qpcr however the procedure for sample concentration was not described bovine enterovirus was detected both in cow feces 243 and in the runoff samples ranging from 83 to 167 while bovine coronavirus was only present in one feces sample 11 bovine rotavirus was not detected in any of the samples 
bibby et al 2011 2013 characterized viral pathogens in sewage sludge through metagenomic analysis the entire genome extracted was sequenced by shotgun pyrosequencing in their two studies they followed different procedures for virus recovery from sludge but in both cases they found that coronaviruses were the most abundant human viruses occurring in over 80 of samples bibby and peccia 2013 the human coronavirus strains 229e and hku1 were identified both studies produced a list of the most abundant viruses which could be extremely useful in quantitative pathogen monitoring 
corsi et al 2014 collected samples from three streams in the usa running through an area with rural and urban land use they used an automated large-volume sample collection and virus concentration system based on pre-filtration and glass-wool filter the virus eluates were then analysed using rt-qpcr for bcov and various other viruses around 20-l composite samples were obtained mixing 5-l subsamples collected over time by the system in two different conditions low-flow period and during runoff events for a total of 63 samples the eluates were analysed using rt-qpcr to measure both human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus genogroups i and ii hepatitis a virus and rotavirus and bovine adenovirus enterovirus rotavirus group a polyomavirus coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus types 1 and 2 enteric viruses during the study period all the human viruses were detected in the samples as well as numerous animal and bovine viruses except bcov in the most recent study blanco et al 2019 concentrated 10-l samples of surface waters by an optimized glass wool filtration method see section 31 and used a semi-nested rt-pcr for wild-type alphabeta cov followed by sequencing they analysed a total of 21 samples and found only one positive result for alphacoronavirus which was related to a novel rodentshrew-specific clade by the sequence analysis in the studies conducted until 2019 field investigations also confirmed the scarcity of data on coronavirus in water coronaviruses were rarely searched for and more rarely found although the lack of positive results could derive from the low recovery efficiency of the methods used as shown above however in the early months of 2020 six field studies focused on a sars-cov-2 search in wastewater samples owing to the increasing focus on the environmental circulation of the new coronavirus in australia ahmed et al 2020 collected 100200 ml of sewage nine samples concentrated them with two different methods filtration by electronegative membranes and ultrafiltration and analysed the concentrates with rt-qpcr using with two different primer-probe sets for nucleocapsid protein gene the authors obtained one positivity for each concentration method not the same sample but with only one set of primers and at very low titers 12 and 19 genomic copies100 ml in china wang et al 2020 sampled the wastewater of a hospital at various stages of a multi-stage disinfection with sodium hypochlorite five samples three before disinfection and one for each of the disinfection stages were analysed with rt-qpcr and a culture assay the samples from the inlet and after the first disinfection stage were positive the sample after disinfection was negative all were non infective the four other monitoring studies on this topic were retrieved from medrxiv as preliminary reports which had not yet been peer-reviewed in the netherlands medema et al 2020 monitored sewage samples and obtained positive signals only in 14 778 of the 18 samples collected after the occurrence of the first cases of covid-19 in the usa massachusetts wu et al 2020 collected 10 samples from wwtps after the first known cases of covid-19 and detected sars-cov-2 in all of them with approximately 100 genomic copiesml the same result was obtained after the storage of samples at 4 c for 24 h and for a week again in the usa montana nemudryi et al 2020 collected seven samples of raw sewage which tested positive for sars-cov-2 with a viral load from 100 to 2000 genomic copiesl in france wurtzer et al 2020 collected both raw and treated wastewater from urban wwtp 31 samples obtaining 100 and 75 positivity respectively with a 2 log10 reduction after treatment overall these recent studies confirm the lack of standardized concentration methods for enveloped viruses see table 1 and the need to use the same method in order to be able to compare results from different studies concerns about possible secondary transmission of the novel sars-cov-2 via water are growing with the evidence of its fecal elimination moreover the results of in vitro experiments of prolonged virus survival with declining temperatures suggest that coronavirus excreted in feces could reach wastewater treatment plants in an infective state especially in cool climates however current knowledge is very scarce and fragmentary prior to covid-19 interest in this topic was very low owing to the common belief that enveloped viruses cannot survive for extended periods in water however the assumption that sars-cov-2 is not involved in environmental circulation cannot be accepted without better knowledge as highlighted by the detection of sars-cov-2 rna in wastewater by six different global research groups the ongoing sars-cov-2 emergency and its rapid spread demands new attention on its detection in water the scarcity of information on the presence and persistence of coronavirus in the environment merits urgent research in the meantime we should respond to the ongoing pandemic by taking precautions and assume that there is a potential for secondary transmission in particular we believe that research should address the followingset up efficient methods to concentrate and detect enveloped viruses and coronavirus in particular from water matricesevaluate the survival of these viruses in natural conditions at different temperatures and in different types

 the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper  estimation of the probability of reinfection with covid-19 coronavirus by the seirus model victor okhuese alexander  with sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction pcr test used to detect the presence of the virus in the human host the global health community has been able to record a great number of recovered population therefore in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the recovered class the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium   state for covid-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number 0  0 for and endemic situation hence there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes that is  0 furthermore numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class  the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic may have hit the world in a large scale as predicted in victor 2020 and batista 2020  the ratio of the death to recovery rate has seemingly been a positive proportion however with the sensitivity of the pcr the presence or the absence of the virus in a previously infected host is detectable and as the recovery rate has seem to be encouraging considering the absence of any curative vaccine the question in every quarters to health workers the center for disease control and the world health organization has been if reinfection could occur after a covid-19 patient has recovered clinically a recent study by victor 2020  nesteruk 2020 and ming and zhang 2020 focuses on the epidemic outbreak cased by covid-19 coronavirus due to the global trend of the pandemic with its origin from mainland china in his study nesteruk 2020 used the popular sir susceptible-infectious-removed model to obtain optimal values for the model parameters with the use of statistical approach and hence predicated the number of infected susceptible and removed persons versus time this model approach by nesteruk 2020 has been a major breakthrough in modelling disease control as used by several authors ming and zhang 2020 and victor 2020 among others however although there exist a global interest in knowing the rate of infection that will occur over time globally in this study we adopt solutions from victor 2020 and victor and oduwole 2020 for a new deterministic endemic model susceptible -exposed -infectious -removed -undetectable -susceptible seirus originally developed for the control of the prevalence of hivaids in africa the resulting equations are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations for projecting the rate of detection of the presence of the virus in the clinically prescribed recovered population numerical experiments with relevant simulation showing how the variation of the reproductive number r0 affect the number of infected individuals is carried out as well as a projection for the rate of reinfection by the recovered class conscious effort through evaluating the new deterministic seirus model is done to reduce the reproductive number r0 to zero for a possible halt of the spread of the disease thereby leading to an endemic equilibrium to eradicate the disease in a later time in the future  cc-by-nc-nd 40

preprint  https doiorg101101 doiorg10 2020 in summary this study aims to use the new deterministic endemic seirus compartmental model of the covid-19 coronavirus dynamics which combines quarantineobservatory procedures and behavioral changesocial distancing in the control and eradication of the disease in the most exposed sub-population to predict the chances of reinfection by the recovered class in the population the wide spread of the covid-19 coronavirus and the lack or inefficiency of purposeful and result based intervention is a great call for other empirical and scientific interventions which seeks to review strategic models and recommendations of social and scientific research for disease control although previous studies have been tailored towards the epidemiology and the disease-free equilibrium where the reproductive number of the infectious population is at its barest minimum this study seeks to study the evaluative impact of the endemic equilibrium of a new endemic deterministic model while taking into consideration that possibility of the recovered population being undetectable and fit to be moved to the susceptible compartment which will therefore imply a zero secondary infection of the disease globally also this research work will contribute significantly to recent research findings by victor 2020 nesteruk 2020 and ming and zhang 2020 as well as inform government non-government organizations as well as policy makers decision on sustainable policies to prevent the spread of the disease based on specific age groups of the active population as suggested in victor 2020  the model variables and parameters for the investigation of the stability analysis of the equilibrium state for the new deterministic endemic model is given by proportion of population from susceptible to exposedlatent class proportion of removed population still being observed and being moved to susceptible class   incidence rate or force of infection in the population the following assumptions as suggested in victor 2020 and victor and oduwole 2020 helps in the derivation of the model 1 there is no emigration from the total population and there is no immigration into the population a negligible proportion of individuals move in and out of the population at a given time 3 the susceptible population are first exposed to a latent class where they can infected or not 4 some infected individuals move to the removed class when they are quarantined for observatory procedures 5 the recruitment from the -class into the -class is through contacts from population in the i-class to the s-class 6 the recruitment into the -class from the -class at a rate   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a

medrxiv preprint 7 the recruitment into the -class from the -class depends on the effectiveness of the quarantine and observatory procedure at a rate  is an additional death rate in the and classes due to infection for both juvenile and adult sub-population denoted by and respectively this study uses the deterministic endemic model where a susceptible class is a class that is yet to be infected but is open to infection as interactions with members of the -class continuous an infected individual is one who has contracted the coronavirus and is at some stage of infection a removed individual is one that is confirmed to have the virus with its expected symptoms and is under quarantine while following relevant observatory procedures a member of the undetectable class is one that has been removed and does not secrete the virus anymore and has been satisfied by the who standard to be in the undetectable class the following diagram describes the dynamic of seirus framework and will be useful in the formulation of model equations algorithm source victor 2020  the resulting equations below are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations for projecting the rate of detection

httpsdoiorg10 1101 similarly from the trace of the jacobian matrix   given in equation 20 this implies that as a pandemic as declared by who 2020 the covid-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures therefore for the recovered population the chances reinfection appears to be uncertain though closely impossible unless regular clinical test is not accurately administered the basic reproductive number  0  is define as the number of secondary infections that one infectious individual would create over the duration of the infectious period provided that everyone else is susceptible 0  1 is a threshold below which the generation of secondary cases is insufficient to maintain the infection in human community if 0  1 the number of infected individuals will decrease from generation to next and the disease dies out and if 0  1 the number of infected individuals will increase from generation to the next and the disease will persist to compute the basic reproductive number  0  of the model with incidence rate for the recovered population assumed to vanish such that  0 and we employ the next generation method as applied by diekmann et al 2009  van den driessche and watmough 2002  and  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted

reproductive number  0  0 by equation 33 shows that with no incidence rate in the recovered population there is no chances secondary infection by covid-19 coronavirus patients who have been clinically declared negative and free from the virus with the virus completely cleared from their system hence although there currently exist no clinical vaccine for the cure of covid-19 coronavirus with equation 33 there is a high chance of no case of reinfection after clinical recovery from the virus according to the who 2020 the total cases of covid-19 coronavirus worldwide stands about 900000 with a total of about 190000 recovery and the current total deaths is about 44000 from about 172 countries  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted

as a pandemic as declared by who 2020 the covid-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures the basic reproductive number was found to be 0  0 and hence shows that there is a high chance of no secondary infections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population

on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class however unless there is a dedicated effort from individual population government health organizations policy makers and stakeholders the world would hardly be reed of the covid-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery until a curative vaccine is developed  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who

on household consumption and poverty amory martin maryia markhvida stphane hallegatte brian walsh  the covid-19 pandemic has caused a massive economic shock across the world due to business interruptions and shutdowns from social-distancing measures to evaluate the socio-economic impact of covid-19 on individuals a micro-economic model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household income savings consumption and poverty the model assumes two periods a crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption and a recovery period when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level the san francisco bay area is used as a case study and the impacts of a lockdown are quantified accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance ui and the cares act federal stimulus assuming a shelter-in-place period of three months the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 171 to 259 in the bay area in the absence of social protection and the lowest income earners would suffer the most in relative terms if fully implemented the combination of ui and cares could keep the increase in poverty close to zero and reduce the average recovery time for individuals who suffer an income loss from 118 to 67 months however the severity of the economic impact is spatially heterogeneous and certain communities are more affected than the average and could take more than a year to recover overall this model is a first step in quantifying the householdlevel impacts of covid-19 at a regional scale this study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect macroeconomic effects the role of uncertainty in households decision-making and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks eg natural disasters  covid-19 has led to severe and acute losses in many economies around the world due to illness and and government-mandated social distancing orders the impact and duration of the economic crisis on individual households resulting from the pandemic is difficult to predict as many uncertainties surround the crisis duration ie length of stay-at-home orders as well as impacted industries and the post-crisis consumption and recovery there is a plethora of ongoing research studies on estimating the economic impact of covid-19 in both emerging and developed countries due to widespread business closures especially in lower income populations national economies are expected to contract leading to a dramatic rise in unemployment and poverty rates a report from the world bank estimated that 11 million people could fall into poverty across east asia and the pacific world bank 2020  analyzing the effect of the pandemic on poor communities across four continents buheji et al 2020 estimates that 49 million individuals will be driven into extreme poverty in 2020 living on less than 190 per day the us economy where gross domestic product gdp fell by 48 in the first quarter is projected to fall into recession in 2020 with a contraction of 50 in a likely scenario mckibbin and fernando 2020 fernandes 2020  the european commission estimates that the euro area economy would decline by 725 in 2020 with all countries expected to fall into a recession european commission 2020  developing countries in south-east asia are also vulnerable to the global economic disruption of the pandemic due to decrease in trade foreign investment and tourism according to the international monetary fund imf the asean-5 which consists of indonesia malaysia philippines thailand and vietnam is predicted to decline by 06 in 2020 international monetary fund 2020  reduction in remittances from high-income countries to low-and middle-income countries is likely to have a significant impacts in many countries such as nepal or the philippines where remittances represent a large share of many households income in the six week span of march 15 to april 25 a record 302 americans have filed for unemployment benefits as first-time claimants according to the us department of labor the unemployment rate in the us hit a staggering 147 officially in april from statistics released by the us bureau of labor statistics and some predictions estimate even higher unemployment rates above 20 bick and blandin 2020  according to the pew research center the highest risks of layoffs are in the accommodations retail trade transportation services and arts entertainment and recreation services sector kochhar and barroso 2020  additionally among the sectors that lost the most jobs in march are the leisure and hospitality and health and educational services burns 2020  using a variable vector autoregression model based on data from recent disasters ludvigson et al 2020 estimates a cumulative loss of 24 million jobs in the us over the course of 10 months largely due to a 17 loss in service sector employment only 37 of jobs in the us can be performed at home and many lower-income countries have a lower share of jobs that can be performed remotely dingel and neiman 2020  consumer discretionary spending is in free fall as non-essential businesses are closed and individuals are saving more analyzing data from a personal finance website baker et al 2020 found that consumer spending in the united states is highly dependent on the severity of the diseases outbreak in the state and the strength of the local governments response although ongoing research is assessing the economic ramifications of covid-19 most of these studies are focused on the macroeconomic and financial impact of the coronavirus impact on national economies are then translated into socio-economic impact on individuals including consumption and poverty rates top-down approach  the goal of this study is to analyze the socio-economic impacts of the covid-19 containment at the household level bottom-up approach  while this approach is not expected to replace macro-level analyses that can better capture the interaction across sectors and countries or the effect of macroeconomic aggregated it can complement it by providing much finer estimates of the distributional impacts it can also better account for households coping capacity the role of peoples savings and the higher resilience of multi-job households to understand the impacts of the loss of revenue on the lower income level populations a household well-being formulation is adopted following the work of hallegatte et al 2016  the original household well-being model was developed for the disaster impact of an earthquake and applied to the bay area in california markhvida et al 2020  in addition the household model has also been applied to estimate household-level resilience to natural disasters in fiji the philippines and sri lanka walsh and hallegatte 2018  here the economic shock of covid-19 is represented by loss of income in certain industry sectors during a pre-defined crisis period the impact of the coronavirus on household consumption savings and recovery time is analyzed as well as changes poverty rates and geospatial inequality distributions with different assumptions regarding the social protection system since california has been affected early and high-frequency data on the situation of households are available in the us the bay area is a good case study to develop and validate the model which we then plan to apply in other countries and regions to evaluate the socio-economic impact of covid-19 on individuals a micro-economic model is built to estimate the household consumption and well-being the model is used to quantify the effects of mandatory shelter-in-place orders as well as the effectiveness of social benefits the san francisco bay area is used as a case study where impact of the lockdown and the recently passed cares act federal stimulus package are evaluated in conjunction with state unemployment insurance ui benefits the model and approach can be easily transferred to other countries and regions even though differences in the availability of data eg regarding financial savings may make it necessary to make further approximations in other contexts the bay area enacted a shelter-in-place order on march 16 2020 in six counties san francisco santa clara san mateo marin county alemeda county contra costa soon after a mandatory stay-at-home order across california was issued on march 19 2020 this major business perturbation has led to a sharp rise in unemployment and severe economic repercussions schwartz 2020  on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act was signed into us law which among other stimulus measures extends unemployment benefits and gives single payouts to individuals the number of reported total cases per county across bay area as well as the daily cases are shown in figure 1  rissman and merenlender 2008 right for the case study of the bay area the socio-economic impacts of covid-19 of the following 9 counties are modeled in alphabetical order 1 alameda 2 contra costa 3 marin 4 napa 5 san francisco 6 san mateo 7 santa clara 8 solona and 9 sonoma county  figure 1  the total population of the bay area is greater than 7302000 inhabitants the household data is sourced from census tracts information using the simplyanalytics platform which details income investments savings employed and other relevant data for the year 2016 simplyanalytics 2016  an income loss schedule is implemented according to industry sectors to model the shock of the covid-19 crisis on households from economic impacts related to illness layoffs and loss of activity due to social distancing orders the income drop per sector is modeled according to table 1 using the 15 aggregated industry sectors from the us bureau of economic analysis bea the hardest hit industries are assumed to be construction retail trade transportation arts and entertainment leatherby and gelles 2020  affected individuals are assumed to have a 100 loss of labor income during the shelter-in-place order which in this study is referred to as the crisis period  to investigate the impacts of policies on per capita consumption and well-being the following three case studies a b and c are explicitly considered  case a base this is the initial base case where no unemployment insurance nor stimulus benefit package are considered in this case households will smooth their consumption during the crisis by using their savings  case b ui this is the unemployment insurance ui case where the regular california ui benefits are considered in this case individuals who lose their job can receive between 40 and 450 per week for a maximum duration of 26 weeks 6 months according to california law an individual can claim ui benefits from a minimum gross income of 900quarter 300month the maximum ui benefit is capped for an individual earning 11676quarter 3892month or more  less per year will receive 1200 individuals earning more than 75000 will receive checks reduced by 50 for every additional 100 above that threshold individuals having a gross yearly income over 99000 will not receive a stimulus check couples filing jointly and additional benefits for children dependents under the age of 16 500 per dependent child are not explicitly modeled due to lack of data as for all analysis of post-disaster support and social protection impact assessments it is critical to consider the practical implementation of the measures and to include in the analysis unavoidable exclusion errors in this model the exclusion error is estimated as 40 which is based on 2019 unemployment insurance rates in california according to the employment development department edd appendix b to investigate the importance of implementation of response measures various assumptions on this parameter are explored excluded individuals are assumed not to receive state ui nor cares due to ineligibility claim processing errors exhaustion of ui benefits or other reasons undocumented immigrants which represent 90 of the total labor force in california according to the pew research center passel et al 2016  are explicitly modeled and are also expected to receive no state nor federal benefits the unemployment benefits from state and federal levels as well as the stimulus checks are given to individuals with a random time delay representing the delay from the onset of the crisis to the benefits arriving in individual bank accounts the time delays for each are modeled randomly and independently assuming a lognormal distribution with mean six weeks and standard deviation of three weeks to investigate the impact of covid-19 on lower income populations two poverty levels are considered 1 poverty corresponding to the low income level lil defined by the department of housing and urban development hud and 2 deep poverty which is defined as half the income of lil according to hud lil is defined for household gross annual income less than 25844 thus deep poverty is defined for gross annual income less than 12922 these poverty measures closely match the california poverty measure cpm developed by the public policy institute of california bohn et al 2019  from the census tract data the poverty rate of the bay area is 171 and the deep poverty rate is 168 using the census tract data a household-level economic model is built divided into two periods 1 crisis period which simulates the duration of the shelter-in-place order and subsequent loss of income and 2 the recovery period during the crisis period affected individuals will suffer an income loss table 1  and use precautionary savings to replenish consumption the income shock is assumed to begin on the first day of the crisis and last until full economic reopening during recovery income is assumed to be fully replenished to pre-crisis levels and savings are replenished using a marginal savings rate of 10 a household recovery time is defined as the time it will take to fully replenish its savings to pre-crisis levels unemployment insurance from state and federal levels replenish consumption while the cares single paycheck is assumed to replenish savings directly the methodology modeling and optimization are presented in full detail in appendix a in this section the crisis is assumed to last three months t c  3 representing a time period starting from the bay area shelter-in-place order on march 16 2020 to a full reopening on june 16 2020 at the time of writing this report the california mandated shelter-in-place is to be maintained until at least end of may however the order could remain in effect for longer since the daily new cases in the bay area is still close to peak levels  figure 1 figure 2  the median bay area initial per capita consumption is 3989 per month considering consumption during the crisis period and no unemployment insurance ui benefit nor federal assistance the consumption drops for most individuals with 643000 people falling below the poverty level per capita consumption lower than o 2154 per month the california state unemployment insurance ui benefits help maintain consumption during the crisis with cares case c having a very strong impact on consumption levels during the crisis considering both unemployment insurance and cares benefits the standard deviation of crisis consumption across individuals is reduced this is represented by the lower tail distribution of figure 2 c indeed lower income individuals gain more from cares act then their job revenue pre-crisis since the 600week unemployment benefit is an average and not based on per capita income the median per capita savings in the bay area before the crisis is 6092 which represents 70 weeks of pre-crisis consumption with no benefits case a most individuals deplete their savings to smooth consumption with some individuals fully using the precautionary savings for case b considering ui benefits the decrease in savings is reduced thanks to california benefits finally the residual savings are much higher with both ui and cares case c since the state and federal benefits are used as alternative cash flows instead of using savings to replenish consumption the histograms of recovery time in months for the affected population ie those who have an income loss due to the covid-19 crisis in the bay area is shown in figure 3 along with the average values the recovery time is defined as the time needed to replenish savings which were depleted during the crisis the crisis period is assumed to last three months the median and per-quartile recovery times for affected individuals is shown in table  2  the average recovery time for case a is almost a year 118 months which illustrates the severity of the economic crisis due to covid-19 the average recovery time in case b is reduced by 3 months as a result of ui state benefits to an average of 104 months since individuals replenish their savings faster the cares act case c further reduces the average recovery time to 67 months but also reduces its depth most individuals have a recovery time less than half a month in this situation even though the situation is very heterogeneous although the median recovery time dramatically decreases with the addition of cares the third quartile q3 does not drop as much indeed 25 of affected individuals will take more than 11 months to fully recover from the crisis altogether the full recovery takes more than 12 months in all cases as illustrated by figure 4  the figure shows total household savings as a percentage of pre-crisis level the recovery remain long because even with the most optimistic assumptions there are some individuals who takes a long time to fully recover moreover it is important to note that this model assumes that individuals regain full employment and income as soon as the crisis is over and it does not account for the longer-term macroeconomic repercussions of the pandemic crisis in reality the drop in demand while households rebuild their asset and firms rebuild their balance sheet and the uncertainty in the timeline of the covid pandemics is likely to maintain income depressed for a long time period introducing this macroeconomic feedback will be a priority for future work  in this section the impact of different policies on lower income individuals are evaluated the following lower income levels are used to analyze the policies impact poverty level and deep poverty levels figure 5 shows the deep poverty and poverty rates as well as the increase in number of individuals under those poverty levels the poverty rates for cases a b and c are computed based on consumption levels at the end of the crisis and represent temporary poverty rates as compared to annual poverty rates as is traditionally reported for case c uncertainty in implementation is accounted for using a median exclusion rate of 40 in addition to worst-case and best-case scenarios of 55 and 10 under case a the deep poverty and poverty rates temporarily increase dramatically from 17 to 95 and 171 to 259 respectively from pre-crisis to post-crisis levels with no social protection the bay area could have an additional 643000 people in poverty cases b and c reduce the increase in poverty rates by providing income and benefits to impoverished individuals under case c with an assumed 40 exclusion rate the deep poverty rate drops from 95 assuming no social benefits to 49 with cares the poverty rate would still increase by 20 points even with the implementation of state and federal assistance given the uncertainty around the duration of the crisis period the effect of the different policies are evaluated for different crisis periods t c  2 3 6 and 9 months figure 6 illustrates the percent of the bay area population under each lower income level for all three policies evaluated using the four different crisis periods cases b and c reduce the number of individuals for each lower income levels considering cases b and c the time of the crisis exacerbates the financial strains on the bay area population reflected by the increase in percentage of the population for each lower income level figure 6  impact of crisis time on deep poverty and poverty rates in the bay area for cases a b and c the shaded area for case c represents the uncertainty in the exclusion rate with a likely estimate of 40 and upper and lower bounds of 55 and 10 for worst-case and best-case implementation scenarios respectively most notably case c considering both ui and cares benefits reduces the number of individuals at the poverty levels which a minimum at 3 months this is because the 600week extra ui benefits expire at approximately 4 months thus individuals who are laid off and earn less than the ui benefit will get a bump in their income and consumption indeed in the short-term some individuals may benefit from staying unemployed for up to 4 months thanks to the higher income from social benefits the average household consumption losses both total month and relative  saving losses and recovery time for affected individuals by pre-crisis income quintile are shown in figure 7 for cases a and c as a comparison assuming a crisis period of three months and a 40 exclusion rate for unemployment insurance and cares for the base case a with no assistance although the total consumption losses month are higher for the higher income individuals the reverse is true considering relative income losses   the lowest income quintile has an average relative consumption loss of 183 compared to only 59 for the highest income earning individuals furthermore the average recovery time for affected individuals is double for the lowest income quintile compared to the highest income quintile 143 compared to 72 months without social protection the lowest income population is most impacted by the coronavirus crisis on the other hand with government assistance case c the consumption losses are smaller for all income quintiles with the lowest drop for the lowest income individuals most likely average consumption losses are the smallest for the lowest quintile since benefits from the assistance program can be superior to pre-crisis income in certain cases in addition unemployment insurance and the federal stimulus package lead to a more equal distribution of average saving losses and recovery time the geospatial distribution of average household consumption losses  in the bay area is shown in figure 8 for cases a base and c cares overall the economic impacts of the business interruptions due to the coronavirus are felt throughout all bay area counties the effects of covid-19 are particularly felt in alameda and contra costa counties where the average consumption losses exceed 15 in multiple regions cities of south san francisco richmond san leandro and concord are particularly affected in comparison the addition of unemployment insurance and individual benefits from the cares act lead to a lower average consumption loss across all counties in the bay area assuming a 40 exclusion rate for case c certain regions of the bay area even see a moderate increase in consumption due to the social benefits of cares contra costa and alameda counties remain the hardest hit areas with consumption losses greater than 10 for multiple regions the geospatial distribution of average recovery time for affected individuals in the bay area is illustrated in figure 9 considering cases a and c and assuming a crisis period of three months considering no social protection vast regions of the bay area have an average recovery time over 9 months even exceeding 12 months in certain cases cares and unemployment insurance significantly diminish the recovery time of most regions in all nine counties of the san francisco bay area however the average recovery time of affected individuals is very heterogeneous densely populated regions in san jose san francisco and east bay can see average recovery times exceed a year while some rural regions such as those near marin and napa couties drop below three months  there are several limitations to the modeling presented in this study specifically 1 the distribution of income loss by industry sector 2 the exclusion rate of unemployment insurance and cares and 3 delay in payments for filed claims the underlying assumptions as well as the rationale are discussed in this section firstly the average loss of income by industry sector according to the broad categories of the bureau of economic analysis bea was implemented to reflect the direct impact of the coronavirus and business interruptions which particularly hit non-essential service sectors the hardest hit industry sectors were assumed to be arts entertainment recreation accommodation and food services bea sector 13 art and other services except government bea sector 14 gov quickly followed by construction bea sector 4 con retail trade bea sector 7 ret transportation and warehousing bea sector 8 tra see table 1  this is based on reports from the bureau of labor statistics bls which estimates that the hardest hit sectors are the hospitality and leisure services especially the accommodation and food sectors franck 2020  out of a survey of 10000 participants coibion et al 2020 found that 50 of respondents had an income loss with an average of more than 5000 due to the coronavirus lockdown however there is now growing evidence of second-round effects with unemployment growing in sectors that are not directly impacted by the containment but by supply chain effects eg affected firms reducing demand for other firms or the aggregate drop in demand to estimate these effects a next step is to connect the household model presented here to an input-output model such as the one used in guan et al 2020 to look at how covid-19 affects global supply chains or a computable general equilibrium cge model income loss for affected individuals is assumed to start at the beginning of the crisis and lasts the duration of the crisis at the start of the recovery phase affected individuals regain full employment and the marginal rate of savings is assumed to be 10 of consumption this is a conservative estimate as many employees who were laid off during the crisis will have difficulties re-entering the economy due to the large macroeconomic effects of the coronavirus and the potential for a recession avalos 2020  in addition social distancing measures will progressively be relaxed and some service activities such as food services bars and performing arts will only be fully operational in the distant future furthermore household consumption during the crisis is assumed to be constant where households distribute income revenue state and federal assistance and savings to replenish consumption in reality the crisis might exacerbate savings depletion at the onset due to the delay in assistance under the assumed distribution of income loss by sector and their representative share of the bay area the unemployment rate is estimated at 274 due to coronavirus by the end of the crisis certain estimates such as the calculations from the federal reserve bank of st louis using filed unemployment claims from the bureau of labor statistics bls place the unemployment rate in the us as much as 321 by the end of q2 faria-e castro 2020 as of april 23 the labor department reported that 26 million people in the united states have filled for unemployment insurance in solely the last five weeks cohen 2020  34 million of these are in california avalos 2020  from the bureau of labor statistics bls the california workforce is 19485000 as of 2019 with 731000 unemployed individuals representing a 39 unemployment rate adding the 34 million claimants yields a 212 unemployment rate in california but this only includes the individuals who have filed for unemployment as of april 23 2020 and the number is likely to grow by the end of the crisis here we are assuming that the nine counties bay area are approximately representative of the overall california state secondly the exclusion rate of state and federal assistance cares is assumed to be 40 however there are many uncertainties on this rate considering the unprecedented scale of the stimulus package with our median assumption 40 of all unemployed individuals will not receive state andor federal unemployment assistance during the crisis this is due to issues related to eligibility and to implementation challenges such as erroneous data or system backlog according to the employment development department edd of the state of california the insured unemployment rate iur is 219 appendix b while the unemployment rate is 39 in 2019 this means that in 2019 before the crisis the exclusion rate was 438 other statistics estimate an exclusion rate as high as 59 in california badger and parlapiona 2020  here it is assumed that the state ui exclusion rate will stay constant during the constant the rate may however increase as a result of number of people losing their job it could also go down since the cares act introduced the pandemic unemployment assistance pua program to boost the percentage of unemployed individuals receiving benefits especially gig-workers freelances contractors and self-employed individuals however as of april 10 the edd of california has not received guidelines from the federal level on how to implement the program castaneda 2020  thirdly the delay in state and federal assistance is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with mean six weeks from the start of the crisis and standard deviation of three weeks in reality the delay in stimulus checks could be much higher individual who file taxes without linking their banking information with the irs could receive checks up until september due to the unprecedented volume of 26 million claims across the union in just five weeks the processing of claims and disbursement of federel unemployment insurance ui as well as single payment stimulus checks is likely to be severely delayed hernandez 2020  wire 2020  widespread website glitches system crashes and backlog on phone help lines have exacerbated the problem and contributed to lag in ui payments being issued badger and parlapiona 2020  there are many potential extensions and applications of this study firstly the longterm macroeconomic impacts of covid-19 were mainly ignored but in reality could lead to income depressed for a longer period of time than the crisis the income drop could spread to other industry sectors that feel the secondary effect of the loss of mainly the service and hospitality sectors additionally the role of uncertainty in households decisionmaking could change the rate of savings depletion and the severity of the impact of the crisis households do not have perfect information about the duration nor depth of the crisis finally the impact of simultaneous exogenous shocks such as natural disasters is of great concern since lower income populations will have depleted most of their savings and are vulnerable to another shock for instance puerto rico experienced a 54 magnitude earthquake on may 2 during the lockdown with several buildings damaged although mild this scenario highlights the potential for a real crisis due to an added shock in this study we propose a household-level model to assess the socio-economic impacts of covid-19 on per capita consumption and savings and the benefits from government interventions assuming an income loss distribution for various sectors the model can provide estimates of households consumption losses a proxy for well-being depletion of precautionary savings and recovery time the san francisco bay area was used as a case study the main findings of this study are the following first without any social protection covid-19 would lead to a massive economic shock to the system in simulations of a 3-month lockdown the poverty rate increases from 171 to 259 during the crisis in the bay area household savings and consumption drop significantly and the average recovery time for individuals is almost one year the long recovery time after the crisis will be further exacerbated by a general decrease in demand peoples change in consumption behavior and general slowdown of economic activities second government benefits both state ui and federal cares stimulus decrease the amplitude and duration of the crisis in likely scenario of a 3-month crisis period the increase in poverty can be limited to 19 from 171 at pre-crisis and the average time of recovery almost halved to 67 months thanks to the state ui and the federal stimulus package however the recovery is spatially heterogeneous as certain communities will be impacted more than the average and could take over a year to replenish their lost savings a near perfect implementation of cares act with 90 of unemployed individuals receiving benefits could even lead to a slight temporary decrease in the poverty rate in the bay area from 171 to 165 since the unemployment compensation is higher than pre-crisis income for certain individuals further work will explore the impact of indirect and macro-level impacts the role of uncertainty in households decision-making and the consequences in case of multiple waves of social distancing and the possible effect in case of simultaneous exogenous shocks eg natural disasters indeed these results are particularly important when considering the risk of multiple shocks where the covid-19 crisis is forcing most households to use their precautionary savings especially in countries with weak social protection system the population becomes much more vulnerable to any other shocks including other natural disasters eg tropical storms with the hurricane season starting in the caribbean on june 1st earthquakes a 55 magnitude earthquake hit zagreb croatia on march 22 2020 during the lockdown or the financial and economic secondary impact from the expected recession beyond this first modeling exercise the model can be used in other countries or regions and provide assessment of the potential impact from the shelter-in-place mandates as well as the benefits from different options to provide emergency income support the initial pre-disaster income i o  is where i l o  i oth o and i h o are the initial pre-disaster incomes from labor investments and housing respectively 1  k oth o and k h o are capital stocks for investments and housing respectively and  is the us average productivity of capital the total income as a function of time it is defined as follows where i l t is the labor income loss over time due to the crisis and i u i t and i cares t are the unemployment insurance income and cares act 2020 stimulus package income respectively the initial pre-disaster household consumption c o is where p rent o and p mort o are the rent and mortgage payments 2  initially households have also precautionary savings s o  which they can use to smooth consumption in case of income shock it is assumed that the containment phase last for a duration t c  after this period incomes can get back to their pre-crisis level and there is a recovery period of duration t r during which households rebuild their precautionary savings as a first exploration this study assumes that there is no macroeconomic-level impact of the crisis the only impact is a decline in the income of some households either because they cannot work remotely or because demand has collapsed in their sector people who are not directly affected through a drop in revenue or loss of job are assumed that have an unchanged income these assumptions are acceptable over the short-term but will be increasingly optimistic as the duration of the containment last over the longer-term one can expect all workers and firms to be affected as the impact of reduced incomes propagate through the economic system these second-round effects will be explored in a second phase during the crisis and recovery period households use and then rebuild their precautionary savings and the consumption as a function of time ct is as follows where s o and s f and the initial and final savings respectively t c and t r are the duration of crisis and recovery respectively the adjusted income is the following where c min  1e 3 represents the survival level of consumption assuming people always have access to humanitarian assistance eg food banks finally the household savings as a function of time st are where t is the time which is initialized at the start of the crisis t o  0 and other terms are defined previously the cares stimulus individual paycheck up to 1200 is added with a time delay directly into savings the recovery time is based on an exogenous ability to save assumed constant for all households where  is the saving rate during recovery until precautionary savings are back to their pre-crisis level here we will assume   010 the model with household consumption and savings time series is shown in figure 10  we assume people derive an utility from consumption ut and from precautionary savings vt 3 where  is the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption  and  represent statistically calibrated parameters for utility of precautionary savings see appendix the household well-being w  is the sum of the household well-beings during crisis w c and recovery phases w r  1 crisis  highlighted zones indicate federal assistance and state unemployment insurance where the household consumption c c  c r and savings s c  s r for the crisis and recovery periods are detailed previously in equations the household well-being losses w  are defined as follows where w o is the initial well-being defined as follows the utility at the minimum level of consumption c min provides a lower bound for peoples utility it also provides a higher bound to the well-being impact individuals can experience note that this model does not include mortality and morbidity either due to covid-19 or to health impacts from containment such as under-and malnutrition due to insufficient income mental health implications from isolation or indirect health consequences from reduced access to health care especially for people with chronic disease in this study we will assume that households will deplete their savings to smooth consumption over time in order to maximize their well-being there are not using all their precautionary savings because other shock may affect them during or after the covid-19 crisis so that the utility derived from remaining precautionary savings have an increasing value as they are used in the current shock one important simplification here is that people are assumed to know in advance the duration of the containment phase in reality one challenge for households is to decide how to manage their precautionary savings in the context of a highly uncertain crisis both in duration and magnitude the assumption that the duration is known means that the results from the analysis are conservative underestimating well-being and poverty consequences from containment the one-dimensional unconstrained optimization problem is the following where s f is the design variable the savings at the end of the crisis the optimization problem is sequentially solved for every census tract in the database representing bay area households in this section we prove that the optimization problem eq 13 is convex since this is an unconstrained optimization besides the convex inequality box constraints to show the problem is convex we need to prove that w s f  is a concave function in s f maximization or w s f  is a convex function minimization thus we need to show that w c s f  and w r s f  are both convex functions the following lemmas are necessary for the derivation boyd and vandenberghe 2004  lemma 1 let f x t  r 2  r be a convex function in x for each t  a b and wt  0 then the function  defined as follows is a convex function in x lemma 2 let f x  r  r be a convex function in x and a b  r the function g defined by is a composition of an affine function x  ax  b and f  and is convex in x thus since e t  0 for all t w c is convex if and only if u c and v c are convex functions similarly for w r  u r and v r lemma 1 since 1    0 1    0 and   0 f x  1 1 x 1 and gx   1 x 1 are convex functions in addition since ct st are piecewise affine functions in s f  ut vt are the compositions of affine functions and convex functions by lemma 2 ut vt are convex functions in s f  to conclude w c s f  and w r s f  are convex thus w s f  is a convex function in s f  the optimization problem is convex qed the utility of precautionary savings is of the functional form where  and  are parameters to statistically calibrate assuming an exponential law relation between consumption and savings where a b are parameters to calibrate that describe the exponential law equilibrium between savings and consumption is assumed initially before the crisis which leads to the following relation   b using variational form of the household well-being where  is an instantaneous increase of consumption and  o t is the dirac delta function the variational savings is the following the variational well-being is now taking the derivative in terms of  and setting to zero at equilibrium solving we get the following equation setting   0 at equilibrium conditions the exponential calibration of the utility of precautionary savings is shown in figure 11 with coefficients a  3710 b  0638

  model based approach for estimating the dosage regimen of indomethacin a potential antiviral treatment of patients infected with sars cov-2 roberto gomeni tianhong xu xuejuan gao franoise bressolle-gomeni   to face sars-cov-2 pandemic various attempts are made to identify potential effective treatments by repurposing available drugs among these treatments indomethacin indo a potent anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug acting on cox12 enzymes developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the 1960s 1 2 seems to have the potential to become an effective treatment for the patients infected with sars cov-2 indo can be used not only for its antipyretic properties common to other non-steroidal analgesic drugs as symptomatic treatment 3 4 but also to improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 5 6 and to robustly reduce proinflammatory interleukin-6 levels 7 8 following single oral immediate-release ir doses of 25 mg or 50 mg indo is readily absorbed attaining peak plasma concentrations at about 2 h post-dose orally administered indo ir is almost completely bioavailable with 90 of the dose absorbed within 4 h indo sustained-release sr 75 mg is designed to release 25 mg of the drug initially and the remaining 50 mg over approximately 12 h 90 of dose absorbed by 12 h indo is highly bound to protein in plasma about 99 over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations and it has been found to cross the bloodbrain barrier and the placenta and appears in breast milk indo exists in plasma as parent drug and its desmethyl desbenzoyl and desmethyldesbenzoyl metabolites all in the unconjugated form indo is eliminated via renal excretion metabolism and biliary excretion with a mean half-life of about 45 h the following dosage regimens are recommended in the fda label for the different indications of indo ir 9 indo 25 mg twice a day or three times a day if this is well tolerated increase the daily dosage by 25 mg or by 50 mg until a total daily dose of 150200 mg in 3 or 4 divided doses is reached indo sr 10 75 mg once a day can be substituted for indo ir capsules 25 mg three times a day however there will be significant differences between the two dosage regimens in indo blood levels especially after 12 h in addition indo sr 75 mg twice a day can be substituted for indo ir capsules 50 mg three times a day in 2006 indo has been shown to have antiviral properties against coronaviruses including human sars-cov-1 and canine coronavirus ccov 11 the study conducted in dogs identified indo as a potent inhibitor of coronavirus replication and suggested that having both anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities indo could be beneficial in sars therapy in this study the in-vivo antiviral efficacy was determined by evaluating virus titres in ccov-infected dogs treated orally with indo 1 mgkg body weight the therapeutic dose in human 12 and dog 13 this dosage regimen was associated with a dramatic decrease in virus titres in the feces of the treated animals for 4 days the antiviral activity of indo was shown to be associated with the activation of the doublestranded rna dsrnadependent protein kinase r pkr indo at concentrations in the low micromolar range activates pkr leading to an interferon and dsrnaindependent phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor2 subunit 14 shutting off viral protein translation and blocking viral replication 15 a recent study conducted in-vitro and in ccov infected dogs showed that indo has also a direct and potent antiviral activity against the sars cov-2 pseudovirus 16 in this study the rate of recovery in ccov-infected dogs treated orally with indo 1 mgkg body weight was also evaluated these new data indicated that indo has a potency comparable to the potency of hydroxychloroquine hcq 17 and remdesivir 18 and that indo could be a very effective potential treatment of patients affected by the sars cov-2 it is important to note that in april 2020 an open-label single-arm phase ii study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral hcq indo and azithromycin in subjects positive with sars-cov-2 with mild symptoms was started this study was posted in clinicaltrialsgov with reference nct04344457 19 this study expected to include 80 subjects will assess the improvement of sars-cov-2 disease status as measured by time days required to improve the clinical status from mild to symptom-free using oral hcq 200 mg twice a day bid for 5 days oral indomethacin 50 mg three times a day tid for 14 days and oral azithromycin 500 mg once a day qd for 3 days overall these data suggest that indo could exert both anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects for the treatment of patients infected with sars-cov-2 the objective of the present paper was to apply a meta-analytic model-based approach using published data to estimate the relationship between indo exposure and response in dogs after administration of an ir formulation and to extrapolate this relationship to humans after ir and sr formulations the exposureresponse model will be used for predicting the most effective dosage regimen of indo suitable for maximizing the potential clinical benefit for the treatment of patients infected by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus indo was shown to inhibit sars cov-1 virus replication with an inhibitory concentration 50 ic50 of about 5 m ie 179 mgl while aspirin was ineffective 11 in a more recent study indo was shown to inhibit sars cov-2 pseudovirus replication 16 in this recent study the pseudovirus model that contains the sars-cov-2 spike was used sars cov-2 genbank mn9089473 briefly african green monkey kidney vero e6 cells were infected with sars cov-2 pseudovirus and treated with different concentrations of indo 0 01 1 5 10 50 100 500 m or aspirin 0 01 1 5 10 50 100 500 m as control at 48 h post infection the level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity in the cell lysates of infected cells at 48 h post-infection pi indo was found to possess a remarkable antiviral activity reducing viral particle production dose-dependently with an ic50 of  1 m ie 0358 mgl and selective index of 500 and caused a dramatic reduction relative light unit to zero at 48 h pi in vero e6 cells 16 two different studies were conducted to evaluate whether indo could be effective in vivo in the first study 11 the in-vivo antiviral efficacy of indo was assessed by evaluating the ccov viral load in infected dogs treated with indo dogs were tested for the presence of ccov rna in feces by a real-time rt-pcr assay and ccov antibodies in serum samples by an elisa test dogs were treated orally with indo 1 mgkg body weight daily for 4 days starting on day 4 pi whereas dogs in a separate group served as infected non-treated controls in indo-treated dogs viral rna titres in the feces decreased rapidly after starting treatment reaching minimal levels at day 7 pi in concomitance with the peak observed in non-treated dogs indo antiviral effect was reversed upon suspension of treatment demonstrating a potent anti-coronavirus activity of indo in vivo in the second study 16 the  of recovery in ccov-infected dogs treated orally with indo 1 mgkg body weight was evaluated dogs treated with ribavirin a broad-spectrum antiviral drug with efficacy against rna and dna viruses were used as a control group the enrolled dogs were confirmed for diagnosis of ccov infection with a canine coronavirus test kit and between 23 days of the onset of symptoms the time of recovery was determined by the disappearance of symptoms and a negative diagnosis by the canine coronavirus test kit 20 in indo-treated dogs a complete recovery was observed after 5 days of treatment the rate of recovery and the viral load inhibition in ccov-infected dogs were expressed in  ranging from 0  recovery at baseline or full viral inhibition to 100 full recovery or baseline viral load the rate of recovery and the viral load inhibition were modeled as a function of time with the assumption that the effect was driven by the constant indo exposure maintained for 5 days the following weibull models were used1documentclass12ptminimal

0333 0667 1 15 24 6 8 10 and 12 h after administration of uncoated pellets 21 human indo ir pk was evaluated at single doses of 25 mg 50 mg and 75 mg in 8 healthy volunteers and 100 mg in 4 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with rheumatoid arthritis blood samples were taken at intervals for up to 75 h after drug intake the results of the study indicated no major differences between pk in healthy subjects and patients 22 the indo sr at the dose of 75 mg is a formulation designed to ir 25 mg and to provide a delayed release of the remaining 50 mg of the dose pk samples collected at intervals for up to 12 h in 14 subjects were used for the assessment of the pk characteristics of indo sr 23 the mean concentrations time course of indo in dog and human were obtained by digitizing the concentration versus time graphs reported in the referred publications indo is a weak organic acid with a molecular weight of 3578 gmol that is 99 bound in dog and human to plasma albumin but not to red blood cells 24 data from in vitro plasma protein binding experiments are frequently used to guide the estimate of in vivo efficacy in the assumption that the efficacy is driven by the free unbound drug concentration 25 as the protein binding in human and dog was the same ie 99 the free fraction was also the same as a consequence the translational model was based on total indo concentrations two simulation scenarios were considered assuming that the effective indo concentration in human was driven by the in-vitro potency associated with 1 50 of the inhibition effect ic50 and 2 95 of the inhibition effect ic95 the estimated effective antiviral concentration in human is usually defined as the indo concentration at which virus replication is inhibited by 50 ie the ic50 value however a more aggressive and more clinically appropriate target such as ic90 was proposed for any repurposed drug against sars-cov-2 26 therefore as recommended for other antiviral treatments two target inhibitory concentrations were retained ic50 corresponding to an exposure of 0358 mgl and ic95 corresponding to an exposure of 1074 mgl 27 the time during which indo concentration remains above the effective concentration was used as a driver of the response as commonly done for the assessment of the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents 28 three dosage regimens were evaluated for the ir formulation 50 mg three-times-a-day 25 mg three-times-a-day and 25 mg four-times-a-day two dosage regimens were evaluated for the sr formulation 75 mg once-a-day and 75 mg twice-a-day the extrapolation of the relationship between in-vivo response in dog to human was conducted using the estimated exposures in the two species without adjustment by the difference in protein binding as protein binding was the same in dog and human the data used in the analyses were extracted from the different referred publications using scanit plot digitizer software version 20 29 the analyses were conducted using nonmem version 74 icon development solutions hanover md usa graphical data presentations were conducted using r r foundation for statistical computing emax and weibull models were tested as alternative models for fitting the data the performance of the two models was assessed using the akaike information criterion and the inspection of the observed and model predicted data the weibull model was finally retained as it showed better performance in fitting either the viral load or the rate of recovery data figure 2a shows the observed and model-predicted rate of recovery 16 and viral load data 11 in ccov infected dogs figure 2b shows the curvilinear relationship between viral load and rate of recovery estimated using the weibull model predictions the estimated parameters are presented in table 1 the weibull models properly described the  of recovery and viral load data the estimated td parameters indicated that after one day of treatment indo was able to inhibit 63 of the viral load while 63 of recovery was expected after 23 days of treatment  all the pk analyses were conducted on the mean concentration time course values of indo in dogs and humans the pk observations were obtained by digitizing the concentration versus time graphs reported in the referred publications the indo pk in dog and human was well described by a two-compartment model with first order distribution and elimination processes the absorption was characterized by a lag-time in human and dog by a zero-order drug release for the ir formulation and by a first-order process for the sr formulation the residual error was described by a combined additive and proportional error model the estimated pk parameters in dog after an ir formulation and in human after ir and sr formulations are presented in table 2 the precision of all pk parameters presented in table 2 was  0001 the relative high precision of the estimated parameters was probably due to the use of the mean data in the fitting procedure to the limited number of observations with respect to the number of parameters in the model and to the limited variability on the data the maximal concentration was reached between 1 h and 15 h post-dose in dog and in human with the ir formulation and between 2 h and 25 h post-dose in human with the sr formulation indo is rapidly distributed and eliminated the fraction of the dose estimated as the fraction of the total auc cleared from the systemic circulation in the initial 6 h post-dose is 90 in dog 84 in human with the ir formulation and 12 in human with the sr formulation the corresponding indo half-life in the initial 6 h was estimated  3 h for the sr formulation  15 h for the ir formulation in human and  1 h in dog the observed and model-predicted indo concentrations and the 95 prediction intervals for the mean profile are presented in supplemental material sfigs 1 2 and 3 in dog at the dose of 25 mg in human at the dose 25 mg to 100 mg ir and in human at the dose of 75 mg er respectively the 95 prediction intervals for the mean profile were computed by simulating the model outcomes using the estimated parameters and the estimated residual error 200 replicates of the original dataset were simulated based on the final model and 95 prediction intervals for the mean profile were computed based on the simulated datasets no accumulation was expected in dog after repeated indo daily administration due to the very short half-life the simulated indo exposure at 1 mgkgday equivalent to 85 mgday due to an average weight of 85 kg of the treated dogs in the ccov infected dogs after 4 days of treatment is presented in fig 3 this simulation indicated that identical levels of indo with large peak-to-trough ratio were expected on each day of treatment the estimated plasma concentration in dog following an indo daily dose of 1 mgkg indicated a lack of accumulation due to the very short half-life of indo these data thus supported the hypothesis that the observed efficacy was not due to an accumulated exposure but to the time during which the exposure was above an effective value the effective exposure initially defined as an exposure greater or equal to the ic50 value was estimated to 0358 mgl considering a molecular weight of indo of 3578 gmol and an ic50 of 1 m the estimated time during which the exposure was above 0358 mgl was 25 hday two parameters were used to characterize the  of recovery td representing the time-to-response ie the time necessary for  63 of the total response and g the shape of the curve the time during which the indo concentration remains above the effective concentration was assumed to affect the time-to-response the shape of the time-to-response curve was assumed invariant with respect to the indo exposure according to eq 1 two extreme scenarios can be considered to characterize the response 1 a time during which the indo concentration remains above the effective concentration equal to zero associated with a td  0 leading to a flat zero response and 2 a very large td value associated with an indo concentration always above the effective concentration 24 h a day leading to a flat 100 response any intermediate time during which the indo concentration remains above the effective concentration was associated with a td value providing a graded response as pictorially represented in fig 4 a proportionality rule was used as a straightforward method for estimating the adjusted td in human as a function of the estimated time during which the indo concentration was expected to remain above the effective concentration the proportionality rule was based on the following consideration a larger exposure was associated with a larger effective exposure and the size of the response was proportional to the level of the effective exposure the expected recovery  in human was estimated using the recovery  in dog see table 1 with a td value adjusted for the estimated time during which the exposure in human was above the effective exposure value the adjustment was done by assuming that larger values of td were associated with short time during which the daily exposure was above the effective exposure using a proportionality rule different values of the effective exposure were estimated according to the different dosage regimens and different values of the target in-vitro potency the indo exposure simulated after different dosage regimens of the ir and the sr formulations during 6 days of treatment are presented in the supplemental material sfigs 47 the effective exposure was estimated during 6 days of treatment as the pre-clinical data indicated that a complete response was observed in the initial 5 days of treatment a complete response was defined as the complete 100 disappearance of the symptoms the estimated times above the effective exposure by dosage regimen are presented in table 3 as a function of the target potency associated with the ic50 and ic95 values the effective exposure for the ir formulation was the same on each day of treatment due to the lack of accumulation differently from the values of the sr formulation the repeated administration of the sr formulation was associated with increased exposure leading to an increase of the effective exposure value with time the adjusted td values by dosage regimen are presented in table 4 as a function of the target potency associated with the ic50 and ic95 values a lower td value was associated with an earlier onset of response therefore the best performing dosage was 75 mg sr formulation bid and the worst dosage was 25 mg ir formulation tid the expected  of recovery in human by dosage regimen are presented in fig 4 as a function of the target potency associated with the ic50 and ic95 values the simulated  of recovery in human was always faster than the one observed in animal this because the time above the effective exposure in human  27 hday in the worst-case scenario for 25 mg ir tid was always larger than the time above the effective exposure in dog  25 hday the aim of this study was not to prove the efficacy of indo for the treatment of sars-cov-2 but to show that indo could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of patients infected with the sars-cov-2 virus based on the evidence derived from studies conducted in-vitro in animals and on the model-based simulations the food and drug administration fda approved indo in 1965 under the brand name indocin indo is approved to treat moderate to severe osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis today several drug manufacturers make generic versions of the drug indo was also found to have significant anticancer activity against a wide variety of cancer cell types in vitro and in vivo 30 31 indo performs its anticancer activity in different fashions inhibits proliferation via induction of apoptotic death of tumor cells 29 31 reduces tumorigenesis by enhancing the immune response 32 33 and inhibiting the angiogenesis 34 as well recently extensive studies on various cancer cell types including colorectal carcinoma justified the efficacy of indo to reduce the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and progressive cell proliferation 35 36 coronavirus is an envelope virus with four structural proteins spike s protein membrane m protein envelope e protein and nucleocapsid n protein 37 s protein is responsible for the virus attachment and entry to the target cells which initiate the infection process s protein plays key roles in the induction of protective humoral and cellular immunity during sars-cov this is the reason why the pseudovirus model that contains the sars-cov-2 spike was considered as the most attractive target for sars-cov vaccine and therapeutic development 38 39 in-vitro indo was found to be active against several viruses including sars-cov-1 virus and sars-cov-2 pseudovirus 11 16 this antiviral activity was also shown in ccov and in several other rna-viruses suggesting a cellular rather than a viral target for the drug 11 16 the in-vitro results presented in this paper indicated that indo is active in the human sars-cov-2 pseudovirus at low micromolar range that a good correlation exists between viral load and rate of response in ccov infected dogs that indo has a similar in-vitro inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 pseudovirus and ccov and that a good expectation exists for the human performance of indo in the treatment of patients infected with sars-cov-2 a meta-analysis recently conducted on 9 studies including laboratory-confirmed 1426 patients affected by sars-cov-2 suggests that there were mild or severe cytokine storm in severe patients which was an important cause of death therefore the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients interleukin-6 il-6 plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome if a drug can block the signal transduction pathway of il-6 it is expected to become a new treatment of severe patients 40 to explore the role of il-6 in the sars-cov-2 infection the corimuno-toci trial was conducted using tocilizumab clinicaltrialsgov reference nct04331808 tocilizumab is a blocker of il-6r which can effectively block il-6 signal transduction pathway 41 42 the results of this study have yet to be published but the outcomes were reported in a press release it included patients who were hospitalized with sars-cov-2 moderate to severe pneumonia in intensive care or at high risk of requiring intensive care but did not need resuscitation upon admission the study included 129 patients who were randomized to either usual treatment plus tocilizumab n  65 or usual treatment alone n  64 one of the interesting pharmacological effects of indo is its modulation of cytokine production 43 and its robustly effect on the reduction of proinflammatory il-6 as shown in a study conducted in mice where a decrease of 75 to 80 of il-6 has been observed 44 this feature in combination with the antiviral properties of indo on human sars-cov-1 canine ccov and sars-cov-2 11 16 further highlight how indo could be used to potentially aid the fight against the coronavirus different simulations were conducted to evaluate the expected performances of different dosage regimens using the time during which the indo exposure remains above the effective concentration as a criterion for assessing efficacy two thresholds for the effective indo concentration were considered the first one best case scenario was associated with the concentration at which pseudovirus replication is inhibited by 50 ie 0358 mgl and the second one worst case scenario associated with the concentration at which virus replication is inhibited by 95 ie 1074 mgl the results of the analysis indicated that the 75 mg sr bid dosage regimen was expected to deliver an improved clinical benefit given the larger timeday during which the exposure was expected to remain above the effective concentration following this dosage regimen the doses used in the simulations were selected based on the recommended dosage regimen of indo reported in the label for the ir 9 and the sr formulations 10 the recommended dosage for the ir formulation is 25 mg bid or tid if this is well tolerated the daily dosage can be increased by 25 mg or by 50 mg but the total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg indo sr 75 mg once a day can be substituted for indo ir capsules 25 mg three times a day and indo sr 75 mg bid can be substituted for indo ir 50 mg three times a day among the limitations that could affect the assessment of the indo effectthe in-vitro test showed that indo had a directly and potently antiviral activity against the sars cov-2 pseudovirus and not on the sars cov-2 virus the pseudovirus model that contains the sars-cov-2 spike was used to study the sreceptor interactions and this test is not necessarily indicative of an effect on virus replicationthe assumption that the broad range effects on coronaviruses eg sars-cov-1 ccov and sars-cov-2 can be used to predict the indo efficacy in the treatment of sars-cov-2the assumption that indo inhibits viral replication of human sars-cov-2 at the same concentration that inhibits ccovthere are no deep pools of the virus and what is in the blood reflects what is in the targetthe assumption that the time above the effective concentration is the driver of the efficacythe limited number of dogs used to assess viral load and efficacy in animal studiesthe use of the proportionality criterion in the translational model for estimating the clinical response in human the limitations of the present analyses mainly concern the reliability and the predictive performances of the outcomes of the animal and in-vitro studies the relevance of these studies mainly concerns the proof of mechanism of new candidate drugs these studies provide only indicative information on the potential performances of new treatments in controlled clinical trials as shown by the outcomes of recent clinical trials on hcq and remdesivir 4547 two drugs with an in-vitro potency very closed to the in-vitro potency of indo 17 18 the pharmacological properties of indo suggest that indo could exert both anti-inflammatory reduction of proinflammatory il-6 and antiviral effects when used for treating patients infected with sars-cov-2 the analyses presented in this paper suggest that indo treatment with the sr formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment of patients infected by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus these results suggest that indo could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of sars-cov-2 whose potential therapeutic effect needs to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial as very recent studies conducted on remdesivir and hcq two among the most promising treatments failed to demonstrate efficacy in patients hospitalized for a documented sars-cov-2 pneumonia 4547 the findings of the present analysis could be considered as particularly critical for defining new approaches for the battle against this major endemic disease  explore the possible impact of bcg vaccination policy on the morbidity mortality and recovery rates due to covid-19 infection chuan-hsin chang yue-cune chang  the coronavirus is the new form of an acute infectious respiratory disease and has quickly spread over most continents in the world recently it has

comparisons among countries mortality and recovery rates we only choose those countries with covid-19 infected cases at least 200 the poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between bcg vaccination and morbidity mortality and recovery rates among those 158 countries with at least 200 covid-19 infected cases there were 141 countries with bcg vaccination information available the adjusted rates ratio of covid-19 confirmed cases for current bcg vaccination vs non-current bcg vaccination was 0339 with 95 ci 03380340 moreover the adjusted odds ratio or

disease-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus the outbreak was first identified in wuhan china and it has quickly spread over all continents in the world at the time of writing there are more than 427 thousand people die of covid-19 and more than 77 million people infected the number of cases is still rising without any sign of stopping recently there are several studies mention bacille calmette-guerin bcg might protect against covid-19 1 23 it has been shown that the earlier that the countries established the bcg vaccination policy the stronger reduction in the numbers of the deaths due to covid-19 infection 1 also bcg vaccination slowed down the spread or progression of symptoms and death due to 3 bcg is a live attenuated vaccine derived from a strain of mycobacterium bovis primarily used against tuberculosis tb many nations including taiwan japan and china have a universal bcg vaccination policy in newborns while other countries such as spain france and switzerland discontinued universal bcg policies the us italy and the netherlands have not adopted universal bcg requirements in addition to the specific effect of bcg vaccination against tb bcg has the beneficial non-specific heterplogous effects on the immune system and induces cross-protection against other mycobacterial pathogens the studies show that bcg reduced the incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infection alri and pneumonia 4-6 sepsisand pneumonia-related neonatal mortality 7 yellow fever

significantly increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 tumor necrosis factor tnf ifn- and il-6 15 16 that might be accompanied with the transcriptional epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells and the phenotypic change in the innate immune cell induces innate immune memory called trained immunity 8 17 18 therefore the trained immunity induced

ongoing measures to manage the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 global pandemic since most wastewater virus concentration methods were developed and validated for nonenveloped viruses it is imperative to determine the efficiency of the most commonly used methods for the enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 municipal wastewater seeded with a human coronavirus cov surrogate murine hepatitis virus mhv was used to test the efficiency of seven wastewater virus concentration methods a-c adsorption-extraction with three different pre-treatment options d-e centrifugal concentration device methods with two different devices f polyethylene glycol peg 8000 concentration and g ultrafiltration mhv was quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the concentration efficiency was calculated for each method the mean mhv recoveries ranged from 267 to 657 the most efficient methods were b adsorption-extraction methods with mgcl 2 pre-treatment and c without manipulation c most efficiently concentrated mhv the third most efficient method used the amicon ultra-15 centrifugal device d and its recovery efficiency was not statistically different from the most efficient methods the methods with the worst recovery efficiency included the adsorption extraction method with acidification a followed by peg concentration f our results suggest that absorption-extraction methods with minimal pretreatment or without manipulation can provide suitably rapid cost-effective and relatively straightforward recovery of enveloped viruses in wastewater the mhv is a promising process control for sars-cov-2 surveillance and can be used as a quality control measure to support community-level epidemic mitigation and risk assessment journal pre-proof j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f italy la rosa et al 2020 the virus concentration methods used in these studies to recover sars-cov-2 rna from wastewater include ultrafiltration polyethylene glycol peg precipitation ultracentrifugation and filtration with an electronegative membrane rapid efficient high recovery and cost-effective virus concentration methods are needed to monitor sars-cov-2 and its nucleic acid in untreated wastewater samples for the successful application of wbe for covid-19 surveillance accurate estimates of viral concentration in untreated wastewater require that the concentration observed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt-qpcr assays be adjusted using the recovery efficiency of a particular combination of virus and concentration method the concentration methods used in each of the above studies were originally developed for the detection of nonenveloped enteric viruses such as adenovirus norovirus enterovirus in waterwastewater samples little is known about the recovery efficiency in wastewater of each method for an enveloped virus such as sars-cov-2 the virus concentration recovery efficiencies of sars-cov-2 may be different from those of nonenveloped enteric viruses because of significant structural differences between enveloped viruses and nonenveloped enteric viruses in a previous journal pre-proof highlights  seven virus concentration methods were evaluated to recover cov from wastewater  the mean mhv recoveries ranged from 267 to 657  adsorption-extraction methods with mgcl 2 pre-treatment was most efficiently concentrated mhv  the mhv seems to be an appropriate process control journal pre-proof  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the etiologic agent of the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses 2020 the primary transmission routes of sars-cov-2 are inhalation of aerosolsdroplets and person-to-person contact morawska and cao 2020 yu et al 2020  there is increasing evidence for the fecal shedding of sars-cov-2 and the presence of viral rna in domestic wastewater xiao et al 2020  therefore the presence of sars-cov-2 rna in untreated wastewater suggests that wastewater could be utilized as a tool to monitor for the invasion prevalence molecular epidemiology and potential eradication of sars-cov-2 in the community in an approach known as wastewater-based epidemiology wbe  the detection of sars-cov-2 rna in untreated domestic wastewater has been reported in australia  the netherlands medema et al 2020  usa wu et al 2020  nemudryi et al 2020  france wuertzer et al 2020a  china  israel

development of efficient methods to concentrate and detect sars-cov-2 from wastewater which has been identified as a key research need for wbe  la rosa 2020b  furthermore it is important to determine the sars-cov-2 concentration method recovery efficiency first it can enable the user to select the appropriate method to recover sars-cov-2 from wastewater with optimal efficiency additionally characterizing method performance will allow more detailed assessments of the actual sars-cov-2 load present in wastewater influent as well as any given water source receiving untreated wastewater a thorough understanding of sars-cov-2 concentration method efficiencies will enable accurate measurements in wastewater and allow public health officials to develop appropriate mitigation strategies needed on a community level due to the inherent risks associated with laboratory work with infectious sars-cov-2 who 2020 we used a human cov surrogate mhv belonging to the same genus as sars-cov-2 to evaluate concentration method performance in this study seven concentration methods were evaluated for their recovery of mhv from wastewater the benefits and limitations of these methods are summarized in table 3  these methods have been previously used to recover nonenveloped enteric viruses from various water matrices but have not been evaluated for their ability to detect and j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f concentrate enveloped virus to date except for a few instances medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020  when reported recovery efficiencies for nonenveloped viruses varied widely depending on the matrix and the virus haramoto et al 2018  but analogous information for enveloped viruses is not available of the methods tested two of the adsorption-extraction methods had the most optimal mhv recovery for wastewater samples  furthermore the results of the present study highlight the need to concentrate both liquid and solid fractions of wastewater samples interestingly method a adsorption-extraction with acidification pretreatment also concentrated both fractions of the sample but unlike methods b and c it required acidification of the sample to ph 4 and yielded the lowest recoveries it has been reported that sample acidification might affect virus integrity and infectivity abdelzaher et al 2008 sabatino and maier 1980  this suggests that unlike other enteric viruses cov may be sensitive to low ph further j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f cross-comparison may be required to identify the impacts of acidification and other pre-treatment on the recovery of sars-cov-2 from untreated wastewater samples we found that ultrafiltration using centrifugal concentration devices may also be suitable for the recovery of mhv however recovery efficiency varied greatly based upon the centrifugal concentration device utilized methods d and e  ultrafiltration using centrifugal concentration devices concentrate viruses based on size exclusion rather than electrostatic interactions between negatively charged viruses and electronegative or electropositive membranes in this method molecules smaller than the molecular weight cut-off are passed through the membrane by centrifugation thus the viruses are collected in the retentate fraction these methods have been previously used to concentrate viruses from wastewater symonds et al 2009 ikner et al 2011 and recently used for sars-cov-2 rna detection in sewage medema et al 2020 kocamemi et al 2020 recovery was similar to that obtained for mhv in our study such results suggest that a given centrifugal concentration device may also yield variable recoveries for different classes of viruses in addition to not being the most efficient method for mhv recovery ultrafiltration using centrifugal concentration devices has a variety of drawbacks one limitation is that a pre-filtration step at low speed is required to remove most of the larger debris and cells before ultrafilter centrifugation such pre-filtration can cause the loss of particle-associated viruses in the pellet the resultant pellets from method d and e were analysed for mhv in our study we observed 30 loss of mhv during the pre-j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f filtration step furthermore method d is time-consuming because the maximum sample volume of these units is 15 ml hence repeated centrifugation of 15-20 ml aliquots is required to concentrate a 50-ml sample while no evidence of rt-qpcr inhibition was identified in this study using method d these centrifugal concentration devices may co-concentrate pcr inhibitors furthermore smaller molecular cut-off ie 10 kda or 30 kda device will take significant longer time to process wastewater samples than larger molecular cut-off ie 100 kda and also co-concentrate different levels of pcr inhibitors finally centrifugal concentration devices are quite expensive and often not readily available in many countries thus adsorption-extraction methods method b and c may be more logistically feasible and efficient for sars-cov-2 wbe method f peg precipitation appeared to be a promising approach for mhv concentration because it incorporated the concentration of viruses from both the liquid and solid fractions of wastewater however it recovered significantly less mhv in comparison to methods b and c different versions of peg precipitation have been used for the assessment of sars-cov-2 in sewage but the efficiencies were not reported wu et al 2020 kocamemi et al 2020 bar-or et al 2020  to the best of our knowledge only one study reported the mhv recovery 5 using peg precipitation ye et al 2016  which was much lower than the value obtained in this study this is likely because in our study peg method concentrated mhv from both liquid and solid fractions whereas in the previous study mhv was concentrated only from liquid phase ye et al 2016  using peg concentration methods kocamemi et al 2020 found 1-15 log 10reduction in detection due to rt-qpcr inhibition when using this method and it is likely that the coconcentration of inhibitors with these methods explained their lower mhv recoveries while qpcr inhibition was not observed in our study the rt process may have been inhibited in this study method g ultracentrifugation yielded a mean recovery of 335 which was significantly less than the most efficient methods methods b and c  wurtzer et al 2020a and  used ultracentrifugation to recover sars-cov-2 from 11 ml of wastewater but did not provide recovery efficiency data ultracentrifugation has been used for decades to concentrate viruses from environmental matrices it has been reported that ultracentrifugation at 100000 g is required to pellet this study is the first to evaluate established wastewater virus concentration methodologies for their use to concentrate cov from wastewater and ultimately facilitate wbe since free viral rna can degrade within minutes in wastewater limsawat and ohgaki 1997  most of the rna copies detected in the wastewater virus concentration methods will be most likely from intact virus particles that may or may not be infectious while we identified superior performance by the adsorption extraction concentration methods with mgcl 2 pre-treatment and without pre-treatment it is important to note that the methods performance evaluation was based on small volumes 50 ml of one municipal wwtp and the use of a surrogate mhv it is possible that cov recovery efficiencies may vary based upon the wastewater matrix characteristics eg concentration of total and dissolved suspended solids frequently it is possible to filter as much as 100-200 ml of wastewater using the adsorption extraction method used in this study if these larger volumes were filtered then the adsorptionextraction methods may become less efficient given the increased co-concentration of inhibitors also centrifugal concentration device such as those used in this study may co-concentrate rt-pcr inhibitors to obtain information on the rt-pcr inhibitors 50 ml of distilled water was seeded with mhv and the mhv recovery efficiency was compared to that for the mhv seeded wastewater for methods c and d given that the recovery efficiency was only improved for distilled water by 5-8 it is unlikely that 50 ml wastewater samples tested in this study had rt-pcr inhibitors it is likely that the co-concentration of inhibitors from larger volumes will have a minimal influence on cov recovery but will require further investigation furthermore rna extraction kit used in this study is equipped with next-generation inhibition removal technology irt which is designed to remove pcr inhibitors effectively for soil and fecal samples several methods identified in this preliminary study can be used in conjunction with large-scale primary concentration procedures 2-100 l such as dead-end or tangential flow hollow fibre j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 16 ultrafiltration as a primary step to reduce filter elution to volumes which are applicable to molecular detection assays furthermore the focus of future research efforts should be to compare recovery efficiencies of mhv to those of actual sars-cov-2 considering the multiple benefits of working with the former as a surrogate also the recovery efficiency of various levels of surrogate cov or sars-cov-2 from large volumes of wastewater needs to be assessed to better understand how these variabilities affect recovery efficiency furthermore the best methods for the recovery of intact virus particles need to be identified given the high standard deviations observed in the recoveries of any given method the use of a process control is highly recommended for assessing and normalizing sars-cov-2 concentrations for wbe mhv is a promising process control which can be purchased from atcc and similar companies however it may be difficult to obtain this virus in a timely-manner during the pandemic other coronaviruses andor other viral surrogates could also be useful process controls for sars-cov-2 surveillance thus future studies are needed to assess their use as a process control the culmination of these efforts will aid public health officials

patients on covid19 epidemic using mathematical modeling tingzhe sun dan weng   the early pneumonia cases were identified in december 2019 with unclear origin
1
 the novel coronavirus has been named by the world health organization as coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 which shares similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2
 especially older people and individuals with coexisting diseases are particularly susceptible to covid19 and are more commonly seen in patients with severe diseases
1
 now the covid19 has spread to many countries over the past 2 months and become a serious threat to public health worldwide to impede the outbreak of covid19 series of precautionary measures nationwide have been taken such as activation of emergency response system quarantine isolating suspicious cases community surveillance and epidemiological investigations
3
 as a result the transmission of covid19 in china has been effectively blocked however the occurrence of asymptomatic patients asp has posed a novel challenge regarding the epidemic of covid19
1
 
4
 asp are not quarantined but also have considerable infectivity
5
 the viral loads in asp were quantitatively similar to those identified in patients with symptoms
5
 meanwhile the asp have not been diagnosed as the laboratoryconfirmed cases
6
 therefore imported cases and asp have become novel challenges in china modelingbased work may provide critical insight into the impact of interventions and epidemic of covid19
7
 recently many models have been developed to estimation the epidemic trend and evaluate the effect of controlled interventions

 however the epidemic data have been updated and the number of laboratoryconfirmed cases fall to zero on march 20 at several provinces in china therefore novel datadriven model should be reconstructed to better characterize the epidemic features of covid19 in current work we developed a refined model with two novel features we considered the effect of maximum capacity in healthcare facility on the recovery rate of infected cases meanwhile we also incorporated the asp into our model these two features significantly improved the model fitting under strongly controlled measures asp or imported cases would not lead to a concomitant outbreak however if the average effective contact rate within population was increased our model could predict a second outbreak with only a few asymptomatic or imported patients meanwhile the asp will accelerate the epidemic outbreak of covid19 with reduced latent period and larger outbreak size compared with imported patients our model may provide guidance for formulating controlled measures and reevaluation of the diagnostic criteria for covid19 jiangsu and anhui are two provinces adjacent to wuhan hubei province in china we collected the number of confirmed and cured patients from 23 january to 31 march on the official website for commission of health of jiangsu and anhui provinces
15
 
16
 the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces respectively the data were collected from national bureau of statistics httpwwwstatsgovcn we obtained that the initial susceptible population at jiangsu and anhui provinces 2019 was 807 and 63659 million respectively owing to the epidemiological features of covid19 and declaration of public health emergency in jiangsu and anhui provinces immediately following the closure of wuhan on 23 january 2020 interventions such as isolation precaution and quarantine have been implemented therefore the migration of population was cutdown and we did not consider wuhan returnees since 23 january as previously described
17
 
18
 the effect of wuhan returnees after 23 january was discussed in supporting information discussion 11 to simplify model construction we divided the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces into five variables termed as susceptible population with no resistance to disease s closely observed population c including the individuals under public health intervention or people with potentially close contacts infected patients i recovered r cureddead and asp a the total infected population i was of interest for monitoring the epidemic of covid19 the complete model was formulated as follows

 is a theoretical reversal rate discharged from quarantine or close observation period a usual period for covid19 is around 14 days corresponding to   114 however c all includes potential close contacts without quarantine the actual  should be larger than 114 and reestimated in model

 describes the average recovery rate for infected patients since the healthcare facilityworkers in the hospital has maximum capacity a reasonable assumption argues that higher number of inpatients or quarantined cases will lower the recovery rate as the number of infected cases decreased the clinical care and treatments may be improved these concerns may lead to threshold behavior in recovery rate we used a hill function to depict the dependence of  on asymptomatic to diagnosed patients in which k denotes the threshold and n is the cooperativity the initial values of susceptible population s were set to be the total population in jiangsu and anhui provinces as described above the initial value for i and r commission of health in jiangsu and anhui provinces r  0

16
 the initial values of close contacts and asp were estimated the simplified version of the model without the effect of asp and healthcare capacity related recovery rate is described by following equations
2dsdtc1sc3sidcdt1sc2cc3sididt2cidrdti
 a more complex mutant model without the effect of asp was described by following equations
3dsdtc1sc3sidcdt1sc2cc3sididt2cknkncninidrdtknkncnini
 the parameter estimation was performed using the potterswheel
22
 the trust region method was adopted during simulation initial values of s i and r were fixed other parameters and initial conditions were allowed to vary with lognormal distributions a fit sequence with at least 400 stochastic runs was implemented to exclude the potential local minima in parametric space the basic 
2 criteria was used for model identification 
2n  1 where n denotes the number of data points
22

 local sensitivity analysis provides dynamic responses to an infinitesimal disturbance in kinetic parameters and initial conditions a dynamic system can be defined by xf x  where x and  donate state and parameter vector respectively relative sensitivity s is defined as
simaximaxlnimaxln
 note that this sensitivity coefficient is only locally valid in parameter space the ordinary differential equations were integrated using ode23s solver in matlab r2018b we first formulated a simplified model similar to the seir model 
23
 which captured the major interactions among susceptible population close contacts infected patients and recovered cases model 2 with reasonable guess for parameter values we performed model fitting to reported data from jiangsu province
15
 a total of 400 stochastic runs were performed however the best fit from 400 runs did not satisfy the basic criteria for a convincible model 
2n  1 for both infected and recovered population figure s1a a speculation argued that the actual recovery was slower than model predictions at early time points figure s1a right notably the temporal recovery exhibited a moderate cooperativity with a hill coefficient 4857 95 confidence interval 47 5014 implying that the recovery rate  might be dynamically adjusted since the number of healthcare facilityworkers in hospital might affect the maximally admitted inpatients and medical treatment we modified the recovery rate  by multiplying a scaling factor model 3 we assumed that higher infectedquarantined cases may lower the recovery rate the cooperativity was also subject to model fitting results suggested that the 
2 penalty from model fitting was significantly decreased figure s1b however the model could not faithfully match the infected numbers 
2n  1 figure s1b left since the occurrence of asp had raised extensive concerns about a possible outbreak and community spread of covid19
19
 
20
 
21
 we then incorporated the effect of asymptomatic cases model 1 the complete model we found the fitting was markedly improved and several fits to epidemic data from jiangsu province had even reached a 
2n  01 figure 1a parameters were shown in table s1 we further fit our model to data from anhui province kinetic parameters c and a were reestimated table s1 and the results showed that the revised model formulation could also faithfully match the data figure 1b these results suggested that the effect of asp and threshold behaviors in healthcare capacity contributed significantly to model fitting we next performed local sensitivity analysis to identify critical parameters for covid19 epidemic we used maximal infected patients as the metric to evaluate the local sensitivity we found that only a small fraction of parameters exhibited strong or moderate sensitivities the sensitivity patterns were qualitatively similar between jiangsu and anhui model figure 2ab the discharge rate  showed strong negative regulation for maximally infected patients in both models figure 2ab the transition from close contacts to asp 
1 and contacts between susceptible population and close contacts 
1 profoundly increased the maximal infection not surprisingly the size of susceptible population s and close contacts c positively contributed to viral outbreak these results characterized the locally sensitive parameters which potentially affected viral outbreaks to avoid fitting bias toward local minimum in parametric space we then performed model fitting from stochastic parameter sets totally 400 runs were performed and the top 50 200 sets with a maximal total 
2n  00904 were selected for analysis we found that parameters related to asp were not significantly different between jiangsu and anhui provinces suggesting that asymptomatic cases had similar epidemic 
3 
1  and 
2 figure 3 the discharge rate  in anhui province was faster figure 4 meanwhile patient recovery rate  was also significantly larger than that in jiangsu province figure 3 which is consistent with the epidemic data that all infected patients were cured before march 9 upto 6 days ahead compared with jiangsu province during stochastic fitting we found that the initial number of asp approached zero 00024 in jiangsu province and 01268 in anhui province therefore we set initial asp to zero the parameter n in jiangsu and anhui model was only slightly larger than one implying minimal cooperativity however the threshold level for healthcare capacity k in jiangsu province was significantly larger than that in anhui province p  26982  107 figure 3 implying better healthcare resources in jiangsu province the initial number of close contacts c and their interaction with susceptible population 
1 were enhanced in jiangsu province possibly owing to the larger population in jiangsu province figure 3 collectively the stochastic parameter fitting could unravel both the differences and similarity of covid19 epidemic in jiangsu and anhui provinces the asp covert cases or patients with no symptoms have become a new epidemiological puzzle and may potentially trigger a secondary outbreak

 under strong controlled interventions such as quarantine and community surveillance the mutual contact among susceptible population close contacts infected patients and asymptomatic cases was almost completely blocked ie extremely low 
i i  1 2 3 however if the strong intervention becomes mild the mutual contacts among all population will be increased ie larger 
i the increased fold in all 
i values was simulated by multiplying 
i with a contact factor f 
i  f  
i i  1 2 3 therefore f  1 indicated strongly controlled interventions whereas higher f 1 values indicated mild or no interventions we also varying the number of asp and then recorded the maximal infected population if there was a covid19 outbreak the latent period was defined as the time when the total infected cases became monotonically increased and finally reached a high peak at least two orders of magnitude larger than the initial patient numbers an exemplified case was shown figure 4a when asp  100 and controlled intervention was slightly reduced ie mutual contact was increased f  15 the infected cases were rapidly tolerated figure 4a left however if f was increased to 4 there would be an outbreak figure 4a right extensive simulations showed there was no outbreak if f  16 irrespective of the initial asymptomatic populations figure 4b however if f  16 even a small size of asymptomatic population asp  20 would lead to outbreak although the latent period seemed longer figure 4b top for f  28 the latent period was less than 10 days figure 4b top the latent period and outbreak size were sensitive to contact factor f increase mutual contact among populations while remained relatively insensitive to initial number of asp figure 4b similar behaviors could be observed in anhui model although the threshold for f was reduced to 13 figure 4c these results suggested that strongly controlled intervention to reduce mutual contact is highly effective to block viral outbreak there are more and more imported patients in china since the coronavirus outbreak surges worldwide we then investigated the effect of imported cases to viral epidemic we varied the initial population of imported patients and contact factor f to explore whether an outbreak would be initiated we found that mutual contact contact factor f among different populations susceptible close contact infected and asymptomatic was also the major determinant for viral outbreak in both jiangsu and anhui models figure 5ab the latent period and the outbreak size were both sensitive to changes in contact factor f in both jiangsu and anhui models figure 5ab we further considered dynamic importation a daily importation occurs with different numbers of imported patients results suggested that the mutual contact markedly affected the outbreak size see supporting information discussion 12 taken together lowering mutual contact remains a sensitive strategy to impede coronavirus spreading the latent periods and outbreak sizes were compared for identical contact factor f and initial importedasymptomatic populations results suggested that the latent period for imported cases was uniformly longer than that of asymptomatic cases figure 6a accordingly the outbreak size for asymptomatic cases were larger than that of imported cases figure 6b collectively the simulation suggested that asp can more rapidly trigger a coronavirus outbreak with larger outbreak sizes in current work we used modelingbased approaches to investigate the impact of asymptomatic and imported cases on the potentially new outbreaks we developed a model with two novel features asymptomatic cases and threshold behavior in recovery our model can faithfully fit the epidemic data from jiangsu and anhui provinces in china the model predictions indicated that asymptomatic cases are a more serious threat compared with importation into china the asymptomatic or covert patients can trigger outbreaks more rapidly and terminate with larger outbreak sizes if the strongly controlled measures become mild based on the daily reports from jiangsu and anhui commission of health we constructed a refined model after the closure of wuhan the start of outbreak in china we evaluated the epidemic features based on unbiased parameter estimation results suggested that both jiangsu and anhui provinces have implemented highly effective interventions low 
i values upto 1012 specifically there is stronger control in jiangsu province with significantly lower 
1 possibly leading to fewer total infections in jiangsu province furthermore based on the temporal data the proportion of asymptomatic cases in dynamic and we estimated a median proportion approximately 4446 interquartile range 37315372 which is consistent with a recent report
19

 from the sensitivity analysis we found that regulating 
2 or 
3 alone plays neglectable role to block coronavirus outbreak there is no feasible way to alter total population s and discharge rate  either the seemingly only way to impede viral transmission is simultaneously lowering mutual contacts 
i we found that the latent periods and outbreak sizes are remarkably sensitive to the contact factor f note that the surface plot was removed if there was no predicted outbreak under strong interventions f approaches 1 our model predictions suggested that even a total of 500 imported or asp will not lead to coronavirus outbreak figures 5 and 6 however if the strict interventions were attenuated f  16 in jiangsu and 13 in anhui there will be a predicted outbreak a recent estimation of mutual contact suggested that under uncontrolled situations the average contact rate ie mutual contact is increased by aproximately 30799 1032469 fold
17
 corresponding to a contact factor f  30799 in our model if f  3 our model predictions demonstrated that the latent period ie decision time to trigger an outbreak is less than 1 day and a potentially final outbreak size aproximately 107 therefore strongly controlled interventions are still required provided the undetectable populations of asymptomatic cases notably since the middle of march china has taken strong measures to control imported personnels in airports and railway stations eg quarantine and covid19 test the imported cases will be immediately isolated with no contact with susceptible populations however asp are not easily found and remain a major threat our model predictions emphasized that the asp seem to be a more devastating factor compared with imported patients identical numbers of asymptomatic cases give rise to faster outbreaks and larger outbreak sizes even minimal asp may result in significant viral transmissions or local outbreaks we suggested that covid19 tests should be used for individuals in dense populations eg students teachers or healthcare workers the extensive tests may help to identify the hidden asp to impede potential outbreaks since april 1 china has begun to include detected asymptomatic cases in daily report
24
 therefore strong interventions should be taken especially for asp owing to the unpredictable and covert features liu et al
25
 recently showed a model with asymptomatic patients however the asymptomatic patients all become diagnosed ones with symptoms and are more likely to be presymptomatic
26
 this is in contrast with the recent definition for asp
19
 
20
 
21

 our model also has limitations we did not incorporate death into our model similar to some recent models
8
 
18
 
27
 for jiangsu province there is no mortality in anhui province the mortality is extremely low 6990 06 the model can provide faithful fitting under these situations therefore our model might be helpful for understanding the epidemic features in most provinces from china however high mortality rates occur in wuhan china and several countries in europe a variable describing dead cases should be integrated with reestimated parameters the peak predictions in jiangsu and anhui model are lower than official epidemic data note that the coronavirus outbreak coincides with the traditional chinese new year the capacity for testing is therefore lowered at the start of epidemic a timevarying diagnosed rate could be incorporated to reach better model fitting despite the limitations above the current study faithfully fits the epidemic data our model has predicted that the asymptomatic cases are factors with higher risk compared with imported cases and emphasized the critical role of strict interventions the demographic stochasticity is worthy of further investigations using stochastic models the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests tzs and dw supervised the study designed the study performed the computational simulations analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript  discrete sirir modelling using empirical infection data shows that sars- cov-2 infection provides short-term immunity andrew mcmahon nicole robb c  the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 which causes the covid-19 disease is now a global pandemic since december 2019 it has infected millions of people caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands and resulted in incalculable social and economic damage understanding the infectivity and transmission dynamics of the virus is essential for understanding how best to reduce mortality whilst ensuring minimal social restrictions to the lives of the general population anecdotal evidence is available but detailed studies have not yet revealed whether infection with the virus results in immunity in this work we have extended the generic sir framework to analyse empirical infection and fatality data from different regions to investigate the reinfection frequency of the disease our model predicts that cases of reinfection should have been observed by now if primary sars-cov-2 infection did not protect from subsequent exposure in the short term however no such cases have been documented this work therefore provides a useful insight for serological testing strategies lockdown easing and vaccine design  the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is thought to have originated in china in late 2019 and has since spread globally resulting in the covid-19 pandemic the virus is a respiratory pathogen that causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases but can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in a small number of people which can result in death 1  to date the virus has resulted in over six million confirmed infections almost 400000 deaths and caused huge social and economic damage over 90 of countries have implemented travel restrictions 2 and countless businesses have been closed the spike protein of the coronavirus is thought to be the primary antigenic target against which neutralizing antibodies are produced 3 4 5  longitudinal profiles of antibody responses in recovered sars-cov-1 patients showed that igg levels were maintained in 90 of patients for 2 years however this dropped to approximately 50 of the convalescent population after 3 years 6  while it is too soon to predict the long term serological response of sars-cov-2 it has been shown in a study of 285 individuals presenting with covid-19 that 100 tested positive for igg 7  and a study of hospital staff in france also supported the use of serologic testing to diagnose those who have recovered from sars-cov-2 8  rhesus macaque monkeys that had recovered from a primary sars-cov-2 infection showed no recurrence of covid-19 symptoms upon being re-challenged with the virus 9 10  however it is not clear whether this immunity will apply to the human population or how long it may last for it is therefore important to investigate whether infection provides immunity against further reinfection as this can open up new quarantine easing strategies and decrease the further social and economic burden of the virus sir susceptible infected recovered modelling uses a set of differential equations to determine how the number of infected and recovered individuals changes over time given a specified rate of infection and recovery it was first used in 1927 by kermack and mckendrick 11 and has since been used to model epidemics from acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids 12 to sars 13  variations of sir modelling have been used during the covid-19 pandemic to look at the varying burden on healthcare systems based on public health intervention 14  the absence of a stable disease-free equilibrium 15 and infection rate 16  as well as the eventual size of the overall pandemic 17  an extension of the model has also been used to simulate the changing death rate as a function of the number of individuals infected and it was found that an equilibrium point was reached where there are no further reinfections 18  in this study we have devised a simple dynamic model that uses empirical data taken from a compiled covid-19 dataset 19 to investigate the reinfection frequency of the disease by extending the generic sir framework we have separated the original infection from subsequent infections to produce our sirir susceptible infected recovered infected two or more times and recovered two or more times framework to investigate the susceptibility of a person to reinfection the results of this analysis showed that a small number of cases classified as reinfections should have occurred however no definitive cases of reinfection have been reported in the scientific literature to date this suggests that primary sars-cov-2 infection is effective at preventing reinfection in the short term when using this model the rate of infection recovery and fatality were assumed to be independent of how many previous infections a host had previously had the number of infections deaths and recoveries per day and the populations of the regions were taken from national statistics 19  the number of susceptible persons at the beginning of the simulation n was taken to be the population of the region of interest 19 20  after all infections recoveries and deaths for a day the number of days into the simulation was increased by one tt1 up to tmax the simulation was repeated 10000 times to produce expectation values and standard deviations for the number of individuals classified as reinfections we initially ran the simulation for data in the united kingdom 19 over the course of 106 days from the first recorded case on the 1 st of february until the 17 th of may 2020 when the data was accessed figure 2 shows how the population of each state in the model changed over the course of a typical simulation the number of susceptible individuals initially remained steady until day 55 when there was a sharp decline due to the increase in primary infections figure 2a  the number of individuals infected just once started to increase steadily after day 40 and continued to do so throughout the simulation until lockdown effects enacted on day 53 the 23 rd of march 2020 took effect to control the number infected the average recovery time used in the simulations was set as 28 days as this is greater than the median recovery time suggested in the report of the who-china joint mission on coronavirus disease 2019 21  after the 28-day lag time the individuals infected once started to recover resulting in an increase in the recovered once state through to the end of the simulation  figure 2b  as the number of recovered individuals started to increase so did the number of people infected for a second time and similarly the number of people recovered for the second time started to increase after the 28 day recovery lag time  figure 2c  the number of deaths started to rise from day 55 onwards and fatalities continued to increase through to the end of the simulation  figure 2d  by pooling the number of cases in the infected two or more times recovered two or more times and those deceased from the infected two or more times states at the end of the simulation we calculated an estimate of the number of reinfections that would be expected to occur this number represents the total population that had passed through the infected two or more times state by the end of the simulation in the united kingdom the number of expected reinfections is low 708 particularly as a percentage of the total number of infections table 2  however it is greater than zero suggesting that reinfections should have already been seen as no definitive cases of reinfection have been reported to date this suggests that initial sars-cov-2 infection does provide immunity over the time period of our simulation the simulations were repeated with data from australia 19  italy 19  new york city 22 20 singapore 19  switzerland 19 and the united states of america usa 19  in each case the model was run from the day of the first confirmed infection in the location to the 17 th of may 2020 when the data was accessed the mean number of expected reinfections in each region or country for the 10000 simulations that were run are shown in table 2  in australia the number of confirmed sars-cov-2 infections to date has been relatively low 19  possibly due to early social distancing measures the closing of international borders and mass testing and tracing measures the number of modelled reinfections 0103 table 2  reflects this and so even without immunity from infection no reinfections would be expected to occur similarly in switzerland and singapore very low numbers of reinfections were predicted by the model 6225 and 62 respectively table 2  it is possible that these very low numbers of reinfection cases could have been missed due to misdiagnosis or lack of follow up testing we therefore applied our model to data from germany 19  italy 19  new york city 20 22 and the usa as a whole 19  which have recorded far higher numbers of sars-cov-2 infections 174355 224760 189027 and 1467884 respectively when the data was accessed the number of reinfection cases predicted for these countries was 306 899 33518 and 63525 for germany italy new york and the usa respectively table 2  we reuse remix or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors preprint which was not certified by peer review in the public domain it is no longer restricted by copyright anyone can legally share the copyright holder has placed this this version posted june 5 2020  httpsdoiorg1011012020060320120113 doi medrxiv preprint conclude that it is therefore very unlikely that all of these predicted cases if true were missed due to misdiagnosis or lack of testing the actual number of cases of reinfection that have been reported in any of these regions or countries to date is zero suggesting that worldwide primary sars-cov-2 infection provides short term immunity next we repeated our simulation for new york city with the total number of infections replaced by the number of hospitalisations 23  we hypothesised that hospitalised patients would be more likely to be clinically followed up and reinfections would be documented if they occurred when we ran the simulation with an input of the total number of infections the number of secondary infections continued to increase until day 75 just before the end of the simulation on day 77 when the numbers appear to peak  figure 3a  this was followed by an increase in the number of secondary recoveries after the 28day recovery lag time in comparison the hospitalisation data for new york showed no secondary recoveries as the reinfections occurred later into the simulation  figure 3b  the total number of predicted reinfections from the new york hospitalised data was 124 table 2  however there are no documented cases of rehospitalisations to date it is unlikely that these cases would be missed or that symptoms would be wrongly assigned as a different disease as people would be processed and fully tested on admission to hospital recovery data is sparse or not available for most regions likely due to lack of follow-up testing in germany however some recovery data was available 24  we therefore compared the results of our simulation for germany with and without the recovery data as an input without recovery data the model used a 28-day lag before recoveries started meaning very few secondary recoveries took place  figure 4a  in contrast when recovery data was included secondary recoveries began very soon after reinfections had taken place usually the next day and by the end of the simulation almost the entire infected population had recovered  figure 4b  because secondary recoveries occurred faster there were 76 more reinfections with the reinfection data than with the modelled data  table 2  this suggests that we have in fact underestimated the number of predicted reinfections in our model as no documented reinfection cases have been reported this strongly supports our conclusion that initial sars-cov-2 infection is effective at preventing reinfection in the short term the 28-day lag time used for the modelled recovery data ensured that we underestimated the recovery rate and so also the rate of reinfection to investigate a more life-like recovery rate the united kingdom simulations were repeated again using the modelled recovery data while shortening the lag time for recovery as expected we found that the rate of reinfection was increased as the lag time was decreased from 28 days through to 7 days as there was a larger population that recovered from a primary infection with a 7-day lag time the number of people in the infected 2 or more times state peaked at around day 100 of the simulation  figure s1  the total number of people reinfected throughout the simulation increased with a decreasing lag time with 708 12111 18714 and 26716 reinfections for 28-day 21-day 14-day and 7-day recovery lag times respectively with a median recovery time of one to two weeks for mild cases 21  the 7-day or 14-day lag times represent more realistic figures for the recovery rate it is therefore extremely unlikely that the large number of reinfections that these lag times suggest would have been missed and so we conclude that initial infection results in immunity against sars-cov-2 reuse remix or adapt this material for any

reinfections can occur we modelled actual infection and fatality data from different regions and countries around the world and found that all regions investigated with the exception of australia should have recorded cases of reinfections if primary infection with sars-cov-2 did not provide some level of immunity australia may be an exception as the country was relatively quick to adopt early social distancing measures such as mass testing and contact tracing as well as preventing international travel from high risk countries 25  we also found that rehospitalisation cases should have been seen amongst hospitalised cases in new york city to date however no reinfections have verifiably been recorded anywhere in the world a report from south korea suggested that 116 patients recovered from covid-19 had tested positive by rt-pcr for the virus again 26  however this has since been explained as the false-positive detection of remnants of viral rna rather than reactivation or reinfection the lack of documented reinfections suggests that short-term immunity to the virus is produced by an initial infection however our model cannot predict whether this immunity will last over longer time scales our results are supported by a number of animal challenge studies a study in rhesus macaques showed that following initial viral clearance the monkeys showed a reduction in their median viral load in comparison with primary infection when rechallenged with sars-cov-2 10  similarly ryan et al demonstrated that rechallenged ferrets were fully protected from acute lung pathology 27  finally an adenovirus-vector vaccine tested on rhesus macaques elicited a humoral and cellular response that on challenge with the virus proved to significantly reduce the viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue 28  a report from the who-china joint mission on coronavirus disease estimated the recovery time for sars-cov-2 infection as 2 weeks for mild cases and 3-6 weeks for severe or critical disease 21  based on this we used a long 28 day recovery lag time in the modelled data comparison with realworld recovery data from germany suggested that the actual recovery time may be significantly shorter giving rise to an underestimation of the reinfection rate in our modelled data this was supported by an increase in the number of predicted reinfections in the united kingdom simulations when we used a shorter recovery lag time of 7 14 or 21 days in addition there were no allowances in our model for transmission being localised to regions smaller than a nation or state the daily infection data was likely to be only a fraction of the total number of infections due to asymptomatic or mild infections not being recorded and infections were recorded on the date of testing not the actual date of infection we also note that significant differences in testing reporting and shielding of the vulnerable exist between the different regions in this study in every region we expect that the impact on our simulation would be to underestimate the number of reinfections though these differences mean direct comparisons between countries are not valid taken together this suggests that the actual reinfection rate would be significantly higher than that predicted by our model if there was no immunity conferred by prior infection the results documented here provide strong evidence based on real data to suggest that that there is at least short-term immunity conferred by an initial infection of sars-cov-2 this has implications for serological testing strategies lockdown easing timescales and vaccine development our modelling strategy can also be extended to understand the reinfection dynamics of future pandemics we have developed an extension to the discrete sir model and used national infection and mortality data 19 20 22 23 to investigate the reinfection dynamics of sars-cov-2 in our model it was assumed that the infection rate was unchanged by prior infection and so a comparison of real reinfections against modelled reinfections provides an insight into the true reinfection dynamics reuse remix or adapt this

been made so that the number of reinfections is underestimated these assumptions are 1 there is a large lag time for a recovery to take place 28 days 2 the model does not consider social distancing or

countries in the emr it was important to analyze the number of confirmed cases relative to the size of the respective populations table 1 figure 3 15 the analysis showed that pakistan had 55 cases per

542 on march 28 2020 11 despite being a close neighbor to both china and iran two epicenters of covid-19 pakistan remained free of sars-cov-2 until mid-february 2020 this may be due to the preventive steps taken by the government of pakistan at the beginning of the pandemic the government of pakistan issued a national preparedness and response plan for covid-19 as a blueprint for pandemic preparedness for pakistan under the global health security agenda ghsa after the pheic declaration issued by the world health organization 10 this plan included instructionsstandard operating protocol sops for international flight authorities authorities at other points of entries and health officials 18 the number of confirmed cases was doubled in pakistan in 11 days table 2 which was relatively close to that which was observed in the uae 12 days and saudi arabia 8 days while iran 25 days and iraq 21 days had longer confirmed case doubling times longer confirmed case doubling times indicate a comparatively low spread of infection better understanding and implementation of social distancing and early detection of disease can limit the transmission of disease among the population 19 in pakistan two socio-demographic factors low literacy rate and poverty might be big hurdles in the observance of social distancing and might have contributed to the spread of disease 20 the literacy rate in pakistan is 59 21 most of the people do not understand the grave consequences of disease and do not follow clear instructions from the government in pakistan 243 of the people live below the poverty line earning their living on a day-to-day basis 22 therefore a complete lockdown by the government might not be implemented thus the daily interaction of symptomatic and asymptomatic covid-19 patients might be the reason behind the rapid spread of disease the number of deaths doubled in pakistan in 10 days however iraq 27 days and iran 26 days had a longer deaths doubling time table 2 in pakistan people may not understand the need to see a medical doctor unless they have severe symptoms furthermore they rely on unqualified practitioners due to the scarcity of government-provided health services poverty and lack of knowledge these factors compromise their health status and contribute to a large number of infected people seeking medical attention at a critical stage of the disease 23 this might be the underlying reason for the shortening of the death doubling time the calculated case fatality rate of 21 for pakistan was lower than in other countries of this region ie egypt 71 iran 63 and iraq 49 table 2 the reason again might be that most people in pakistan do not have access to medical facilities especially those living in remote areas and villages that might be infected but were not tested 24 deaths in these underprivileged areas might not be reported or documented 23 another possible factor is 64 of the countrys population is under 30 years of age 25 this age group of people is very low risk for covid-19 due to a stronger immune system that may fight pathogens more efficiently 26 the number of true cases in pakistan was estimated to be 90878 the only way of knowing the exact count of confirmed covid-19 cases depends upon the number of people tested pakistan with a population of 2209 million is the most populated country in the emr 27 the number of tests performed in the country was 625million population which is low considering the size of the population the number of testsmillion population in the uae 79875 and saudi arabia 5745 was significantly higher compared to pakistan this indicates that the actual number of covid-19 cases might be significantly higher than the reported figures only 57 public laboratories in the country are conducting covid-19 testing and capacity is furthermore considerably low 30000 testsday relative to the population of pakistan 1127 since only a limited number of people have access to expensive private testing facilities a majority of people remained undiagnosed due to costs another reason for the low detection of covid- 19 cases might be that 81 of patients only have mild symptoms and patients with mild symptoms were not tested or documented 3 an important factor linked to disease spread is the basic reproduction number r0 which describes the average number of people who could be infected by a sick person currently pakistan has a local transmission rate of 806 28 as shown in figure 2 the number of people who might be infected in pakistan by june 20 2020 could be 051 million this means that pakistan could be ranked the third highest country in the emr after iran 212 million and saudi arabia 058 million by june 20 2020 a large number of covid-19 cases will burden the threshold of medical facilities in pakistan and might result in high mortality according to the economic survey of pakistan there are 1279 public sector hospitals in the country with 220829 registered doctors and 108474 registered nurses one doctor is available for 963 patients and there is one hospital bed per 1608 people 29 as of now there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral therapy for covid-19 although several therapeutic measures are being used on an experimental basis supportive care is provided to relieve symptoms and maintain the function of vital organs 30 thus the best strategy to fight the covid-19 pandemic is to strictly follow recommendations based on epidemiological principles all countries and territories in the emr have reported cases of covid-19 however the number of cases and cfr varies among the emr countries pakistan has the third-highest confirmed cases with moderate case fatality and recovery rates if unswerving preventative and control measures are not adopted to prevent the widespread transmission of sars-cov-2 pakistan could experience an explosive surge in the number of covid-19 cases amounting to an estimated half a million cases by june 20 2020 as determined by the sir epidemiological model this study highlights the need for strategic development and the implementation of policies and programs focused on enhanced testing contact tracing quarantine and social distancing in pakistan  data-based analysis modelling and forecasting of the covid-19 outbreak cleo anastassopoulou lucia russo athanasios tsakris constantinos siettos sreekumar othumpangat   an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in wuhan hubei province china in early december 2019 has spiraled into an epidemic that is ravaging china and threatening to reach a pandemic state 1 the causative agent soon proved to be a new betacoronavirus related to the middle east respiratory syndrome virus mers-cov and the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus sars-cov the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 disease has been named covid-19 by the world health organization who and on january 30 the covid-19 outbreak was declared to constitute a public health emergency of international concern by the who director-general 2 despite the lockdown of wuhan and the suspension of all public transport flights and trains on january 23 a total of 40235 confirmed cases including 6484 161 with severe illness and 909 deaths 22 had been reported in china by the national health commission up to february 10 2020 meanwhile 319 cases and one death were reported outside of china in 24 countries 3 the origin of covid-19 has not yet been determined although preliminary investigations are suggestive of a zoonotic possibly of bat origin 4 5 similarly to sars-cov and mers-cov the novel virus is transmitted from person to person principally by respiratory droplets causing such symptoms as fever cough and shortness of breath after a period believed to range from 2 to 14 days following infection according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 1 6 7 preliminary data suggest that older males with comorbidities may be at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 6 8 9 however the precise virologic and epidemiologic characteristics including transmissibility and mortality of this third zoonotic human coronavirus are still unknown using the serial intervals si of the two other well-known coronavirus diseases mers and sars as approximations for the true unknown si zhao et al estimated the mean basic reproduction number r0 of sars-cov-2 to range between 224 95 ci 196-255 and 358 95 ci 289-439 in the early phase of the outbreak 10 very similar estimates 22 95 ci 14-39 were obtained for r0 at the early stages of the epidemic by imai et al 26 95 ci 15-35 11 as well as by li et al who also reported a doubling in size every 74 days 1 wu et al estimated the r0 at 268 95 ci 247286 with a doubling time every 64 days 95 ci 5871 and the epidemic growing exponentially in multiple major chinese cities with a lag time behind the wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks 12 amidst such an important ongoing public health crisis that also has severe economic repercussions we reverted to mathematical modelling that can shed light to essential epidemiologic parameters that determine the fate of the epidemic 13 here we present the results of the analysis of time series of epidemiological data available in the public domain 1416 who cdc ecdc nhc and dxy from january 11 to february 10 2020 and attempt a three-week forecast of the spreading dynamics of the emerged coronavirus epidemic in the epicenter in mainland china let us first start with the estimation of r0 initially when the spread of the epidemic starts all the population is considered to be susceptible ie s  n based on this assumption by eqs 2 3 and 4 the basic reproduction number can be estimated by the parameters of the sird model as
r05 let us denote with it  it  it  1 rt  rt  rt  1 dt  dt  dt  1 the reported new cases of infectious recovered and dead at time t with cit crt cdt the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases at time t thus
cxti1txt6
where x  i r d let us also denote by 
xt  x1 x2  xtt the t  1 column vector containing all the reported new cases up to time t and by c

xt  cx1 cx2  cxtt the t  1 column vector containing the corresponding cumulative numbers up to time t on the basis of eqs 2 3 and 4 one can provide a coarse estimation of the parameters r0  and  as follows starting with the estimation of r0 we note that as the province of hubei has a population of 59m one can reasonably assume that for any practical means at least at the beginning of the outbreak s  n by making this assumption one can then provide an approximation of the expected value of r0 using eqs 5 2 3 and 4 in particular substituting in eq 2 the terms it  1 and it  1 with rt  rt  rt  1 from eq 3 and dt  dt  dt  1 from eq 4 and bringing them into the left-hand side of eq 2 we get
itit1rtrt1dtdt1nst1it17 adding eqs 3 and 4 we get
rtrt1dtdt1it1it18 finally assuming that for any practical means at the beginning of the spread that st  1  n and dividing eq 7 by eq 8 we get
itit1rtrt1dtdt1rtrt1dtdt1r09 note that one can use directly eq 9 to compute r0 with regression without the need to compute first the other parameters ie   and  at this point the regression can be done either by using the differences per se or by using the corresponding cumulative functions instead of the differences for the calculation of r0 using eq 9 indeed it is easy to prove that by summing up both sides of eqs 7 and 8 over time and then dividing them we get the following equivalent expression for the calculation of r0
citcrtcdtcrtcdtr010 here we used eq 10 to estimate r0 in order to reduce the noise included in the differences note that the above expression is a valid approximation only at the beginning of the spread of the disease thus based on the above a coarse estimation of r0 and its corresponding confidence intervals can be provided by solving a linear regression problem using least-squares problem as
r0crtcdttcrtcdt1crtcdttcitcrtcdt11 here we denote by  the case fatality and by  the case recovery ratios several approaches have been proposed for the calculation of the case fatality ratio see for example the formula used by the national health commission nhc of the peoples republic of china 18 for estimating the mortality ratio for the covid-19 and also the discussion in 19 here we adopt the one used also by the nhc which defines the case mortality ratio as the proportion of the total cases of infected cases that die from the disease thus a coarse estimation of the case fatality and recovery ratios for the period under study can be calculated using the reported cumulative infected recovered and dead cases by solving a linear regression problem which for the case fatality ratio reads
cittcit1cittcdt12 accordingly in an analogy to the above the case recovery ratio reads
cittcit1cittcrt13 as the reported data are just a subset of the actual number of infected and recovered cases including the asymptomatic andor mild ones we have repeated the above calculations considering twenty times the reported number of infected and forty times the reported number of recovered in the toal population while leaving the reported number of dead the same given that their cataloguing is close to the actual number of deaths due to covid-19 here we note that the new cases of recovered and deaths at each time time t appear with a time delay with respect to the actual number of infected cases this time delay is generally unknown but an estimate can be given by clinical studies however one could also attempt to provide a coarse estimation of these parameters based only on the reported data by considering the first period of the outbreak and in particular the period from the 11th of january to the 16th of january where the number of infected cases appear to be constant thus based on eqs 3 and 4 and the above assumption the effective per day recovery rate  and the effective per day mortality rate  were computed by solving the least squares problems see eqs 2 and 4
cit1cdt1crt1tcit1cdt1crt11cit1cdt1crt1tdt14
and
cit1cdt1crt1tcit1cdt1crt11cit1cdt1crt1trt15 as noted these values do not correspond to the actual per day mortality and recovery rates as these would demand the exact knowledge of the corresponding time delays having provided an estimation of the above effective approximate values of the parameters  and  an approximation of the effective infected rate  that is not biased by the assumption of s  n can be obtained by using the sird simulator in particular in the sird model the values of the  and  parameters were set equal to the ones found using the reported data solving the corresponding least squares problems given by eqs 14 and 15 as initial conditions we have set one infected person on the 16th of november and ran the simulator until the last date for which there are available data here up to the 10th of february then the optimal value of the infection rate  that fits the reported data was found by wrapping around the sird simulator an optimization algorithm such as a nonlinear least-squares solver to solve the problem

where cxsirdt x  i r d are the cumulative cases resulting from the sird simulator at time t w1 w2 w3 correspond to scalars serving in the general case as weights to the relevant functions for the solution of the above optimization problem we used the function lsqnonlin of matlab 20 using the levenberg-marquard algorithm fig 1 depicts an estimation of r0 for the period january 16-january 20 using the first six days from the 11th of january r0 results in  480 90 ci 336-667 using the data until january 17 r0 results in  460 90 ci 356-565 using the data until january 18 r0 results in  514 90ci 425-603 using the data until january 19 r0 results in  609 90 ci 502-716 and using the data until january 20 r0 results in  709 90 ci 584-835 fig 2 depicts the estimated values of the case fatality  and case recovery  ratios for the period january 16 to february 10 the confidence intervals are also depicted with dashed lines note that the large variation in the estimated values of  and  should be attributed to the small size of the data and data uncertainty this is also reflected in the corresponding confidence intervals as more data are taken into account this variation is significantly reduced thus using all the available data from the 11th of january until the 10th of february the estimated value of the case fatality ratio  is  294 90 ci 29-3 and that of the case recovery ratio  is  005 90 ci 0046-0055 it is interesting to note that as the available data become more the estimated case recovery ratio increases significantly from the 31th of january see fig 2 in figs 3 4 and 5 we show the coefficients of determination r2 and the root of mean squared errors rmse for r0  and  respectively the computed approximate values of the effective per day mortality and recovery rates of the sird model were   001 and   0064 corresponding to a recovery period of  15 d note that because of the extremely small number of the data used the confidence intervals have been disregarded instead for our calculations we have considered intervals of 20 around the expected least squares solutions hence for  we have taken the interval 0008 and 0012 and for  we have taken the interval between 005 and 0077 corresponding to recovery periods from 13 to 20 days as described in the methodology we have also used the sird simulator to provide an estimation of the effective infection rate  by optimization with w1  1 w2  2 w3  2 thus we performed the simulations by setting   0064 and   001 and as initial conditions one infected zero recovered and zero dead on november 16th 2019 and ran until the 10th of february the optimal with respect to the reported confirmed cases from the 11th of january to the 10th of february value of the infected rate  was  0191 90 ci 019-0192 this corresponds to a mean value of the basic reproduction number r026 note that this value is lower compared to the value that was estimated using solely the reported data finally using the derived values of the parameters    we performed simulations until the end of february the results of the simulations are given in figs 6 7 and 8 solid lines depict the evolution when using the expected mean estimations and dashed lines illustrate the corresponding lower and upper bounds as computed at the limits of the confidence intervals of the estimated parameters as figs 6 and 7 suggest the forecast of the outbreak at the end of february through the sird model is characterized by high uncertainty in particular simulations result in an expected number of  180000 infected cases but with a high variation the lower bound is at  45000 infected cases while the upper bound is at  760000 cases similarly for the recovered population simulations result in an expected number of  60000 while the lower and upper bounds are at  22000 and  170000 respectively finally regarding the deaths simulations result in an average number of  9000 with lower and upper bounds  2700 and  34000 respectively thus the expected trends of the simulations suggest that the mortality rate is lower than the estimated with the current data and thus the death toll is expected to be significantly less compared with the expected trends of the predictions as this paper was revised the reported number of deaths on the 22th february was 2344 while the expected number of the forecast was 4300 with a lower bound of 1300 regarding the number of infected and recovered cases by february 20 the cumulative numbers of confirmed reported cases were 64084 infected and 15299 recovered while the expected trends of the forecasts were 83000 for the infected and 28000 for the recovered cases hence based on this estimation the evolution of the epidemic was well within the bounds of our forecasting for our illustrations we assumed that the number of infected is twenty times the number of the confirmed infected and forty times the number of the confirmed recovered people based on this scenario fig 9 depicts an estimation of r0 for the period january 16-january 20 using the first six days from the 11th of january to the 16th of january r0 results in 32 90 ci 24-40 using the data until january 17 r0 results in 31 90 ci 25-37 using the data until january 18 r0 results in 34 90 ci 29-39 using the data until january 19 r0 results in 39 90 ci 33-45 and using the data until january 20 r0 results in 45 90 ci 38-53 it is interesting to note that the above estimation of r0 is close enough to the one reported in other studies see in the introduction for a review fig 10 depicts the estimated values of the case fatality  and case recovery  ratios for the period january 16 to february 10 the confidence intervals are also depicted with dashed lines note that the large variation in the estimated values of  and  should be attributed to the small size of the data and data uncertainty this is also reflected in the corresponding confidence intervals as more data are taken into account this variation is significantly reduced thususing all the scaled data from the 11th of january until the 10th of february the estimated value of the case fatality ratio  now drops to  0147 90 ci 0144-015 while that of the case recovery ratio is  01 90 ci 0091-011 it is interesting also to note that as the available data become more the estimated case recovery ratio increases slightly see fig 10 while the case fatality ratio in the total population seems to be stabilized at a rate of  015 in figs 11 12 and 13 we show the coefficients of determination r2 and the root of mean squared errors rmse for r0  and  respectively the computed values of the effective per day mortality and recovery rates of the sird model were   00005 and  016d1 corresponding to a recovery period of  6 d note that because of the extremely small number of the data used the confidence intervals have been disregarded instead for calculating the corresponding lower and upper bounds in our simulations we have taken intervals of 20 around the expected least squares solutions hence for  we have taken the interval 00004 and 00006 and for  we have taken the interval between 013 and 019 corresponding to an interval of recovery periods from 5 to 8 days again we used the sird simulator to provide estimation of the infection rate by optimization setting w1  1 w2  400 w3  1 to balance the residuals of deaths with the scaled numbers of the infected and recovered cases thus to find the optimal infection transmission rate we used the sird simulations with   016d1 and   00005 and as initial conditions one infected zero recovered zero deaths on november 16th 2019 and ran until the 10th of february the optimal with respect to the reported confirmed cases from the 11th of january to the 10th of february value of the infected rate  was found to be  031990 ci 0318-032 this corresponds to a mean value of the basic reproduction number r02 finally using the derived values of the parameters    we have run the sird simulator until the end of february the simulation results are given in figs 14 15 and 16 solid lines depict the evolution when using the expected mean estimations and dashed lines illustrate the corresponding lower and upper bounds as computed at the limits of the confidence intervals of the estimated parameters again as figs 15 and 16 suggest the forecast of the outbreak at the end of february through the sird model is characterized by high uncertainty in particular in scenario ii by february 29 simulations result in an expected actual number of 8m infected cases corresponding to a 13 of the total population with a lower bound at 720000 and an upper bound at 37m cases similarly for the recovered population simulations result in an expected actual number of 45m corresponding to a 8 of the total population while the lower and upper bounds are at 430000 and 23m respectively finally regarding the deaths simulations under this scenario result in an average number of 14000 with lower and upper bounds at 900 and 100000 importantly under this scenario the simulations shown in fig 14 suggest a decline of the outbreak at the end of february table 1 summarizes the above results for both scenarios we note that the results derived under scenario ii seem to predict a slowdown of the outbreak in hubei after the end of february we have proposed a methodology for the estimation of the key epidemiological parameters as well as the modelling and forecasting of the spread of the covid-19 epidemic in hubei china by considering publicly available data from the 11th of january 2020 to the 10th of february 2020 by the time of the acceptance of our paper according to the official data released on the 29th of february the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases in hubei was 67000 that of recovered was 31300 and the death toll was 2800 these numbers are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of february that are based on scenario i importantly by assuming a 20-fold scaling of the confirmed cumulative number of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the confirmed number of the recovered cases in the total population forecasts show a decline of the outbreak in hubei at the end of february based on this scenario the case fatality rate in the total population is of the order of 015 at this point we should note that our sird modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics the heterogeneous contact transmission network the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic the characteristics of the population eg the effect of the age people who had already health problems also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported of note covid-19 which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route 21 had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and quarantine of wuhan on january 23 having thus infected unknown numbers of people the number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial these cases which possibly represent the bulk of the covid-19 infections remain unrecognized especially during the influenza season 22 this highly likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context distorting epidemiologic reality another important factor that should be taken into consideration pertains to the diagnostic criteria used to determine infection status and confirm cases a positive pcr test was required to be considered a confirmed case by chinas novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program in the early phase of the outbreak 14 however the sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel viral pathogen may only be 30-50 thereby often resulting in false negatives particularly early in the course of illness to complicate matters further the guidance changed in the recently-released fourth edition of the program on february 6 to allow for diagnosis based on clinical presentation but only in hubei province 14 the swiftly growing epidemic seems to be overwhelming even for the highly efficient chinese logistics that did manage to build two new hospitals in record time to treat infected patients supportive care with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo in intensive care units icus is critical for severe respiratory disease large-scale capacities for such level of medical care in hubei province or elsewhere in the world for that matter amidst this public health emergency may prove particularly challenging we hope that the results of our analysis contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak so as to contain the novel coronavirus as soon as possible and mitigate its effects regionally in mainland china and internationally in the digital and globalized world of today new data and information on the novel coronavirus and the evolution of the outbreak become available at an unprecedented pace still crucial questions remain unanswered and accurate answers for predicting the dynamics of the outbreak simply cannot be obtained at this stage we emphatically underline the uncertainty of available official data particularly pertaining to the true baseline number of infected cases that may lead to ambiguous results and inaccurate forecasts by orders of magnitude as also pointed out by other investigators 1 17 22  presence of sars-coronavirus-2 rna in sewage and correlation with reported
covid-19 prevalence in the early stage of the epidemic in the netherlands gertjan medema leo heijnen goffe elsinga ronald italiaander anke brouwer   in december 2019 an outbreak of coronavirus respiratory disease called covid-19 was
detected in wuhan china the outbreak was caused by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the outbreak is now widespread and who declared a pandemic on
march 11 2020 when the disease was reported in 114 countries1 the
primary mode of transmission of sars-cov-2 is via respiratory droplets that people produce
when they cough sneeze or exhale and the virus may also be spread via fomites2 sars-cov-2 is 82 similar to the sars coronavirus that caused an outbreak in
2003 then 1673 of patients with sars were reported to have diarrhea in addition
to respiratory symptoms3 and transmission of sars through water droplets
from faeces via air ventilation systems in amoy gardens in hong kong was reported4 diarrhea is also reported in a significant proportion of the covid-19 cases
and recent reports show that sars-cov-2 has been detected in stool samples of covid-19
cases59 the shedding of sars-cov-2
was studied in a cluster of nine cases and was present at 107 rna copiesstool
swab of a gram faeces one week after symptom onset and decreased to 103 rna
copiesswab three weeks after symptom onset10 these authors could not
detect infectious sars-cov-2 in stool samples with high rna concentrations another
study11 reported that in two out of four stool samples with high
sars-cov-2 rna concentrations infective sars-cov-2 was detected with cultures combined with
electron microscopy although it is unlikely that wastewater will become an important
transmission pathway for coronaviruses like sars-cov-212 increasing
circulation of the virus in the population will increase the virus load into the sewer
systems of our cities it is important to collect information about the occurrence and fate
of this new virus in sewage to understand if they pose a health risk to workers exposed to
wastewater moreover sewage surveillance13 of sars-cov-2 rna could be a
tool to monitor the circulation of covid-19 in our communities this could complement
current clinical surveillance which is underreporting the true number of people infected
with sars-cov-2 as testing is limited to the covid-19 patients with the most severe
symptoms sewage surveillance could also serve as an early warning of reemergence of
covid-19 in cities much like the sewage surveillance for the poliovirus that has been in
place in the netherlands and other countries for this purpose14 the
objective of this investigation was to identify if sars-cov-2 rna is present in domestic
wastewater of cities and a main airport during the early stages of the covid-19 epidemic in
the netherlands the sars-cov-2 rna signal strength in wastewater at the inlet of the
wastewater treatment plant was compared to the reported covid-19 cases in the service area
of that plant to obtain an indication of the sensitivity of sewage surveillance for
sars-cov-2 rna before the onset of the epidemic in the netherlands wastewater treatment plants wwtp
were selected that serve two large- and three medium-sized cities and the main airport
supporting information tables s1 s2 the operators of the wwtp sampled a 24 h flow-dependent
composite sample of 250 ml that was stored at 4 c during sampling four rounds of
samples were taken in february and march 2020 supporting information table s2 the first sampling round turned out to be 3 weeks before the
first covid-19 case was recognized by the health surveillance system in the netherlands
on february 2715 the second third and fourth sampling rounds were 1
week 25 weeks and 4 weeks into the epidemic in the netherlands as the epidemic
progressed a wwtp tilburg in one of the most affected areas was included in the
sampling scheme sample transport concentration by ultrafiltration extraction of viral rna and
quantification of rna with a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and the
quality assurance of these methods are detailed in the supporting information four primersprobe sets were used in this study the
n1n3 set from the cdc16 that each target a different region of
the nucleocapsid n gene and the set against the envelope protein e gene from corman et
al17 to include targets against two separate sars-cov-2 genes
supporting information table s4 to get an indication of the sensitivity of the monitoring of sewage a proxy for the
period prevalence of covid-19 in the cities served by the wwtp sampled was created using
1 the cumulative number of covid-19 cases reported per day from february 27 to march
2615 for the cities that are served by each of the wwtp as the
numerator and 2 the number of people served by each of the wwtp as the denominator the
number of inhabitants in the catchment of the wwtp was estimated from the design capacity
in inhabitant equivalents of each of the wwtp and the average difference between design
capacity and number of inhabitants in the netherlands supporting information table s2 the recovery of f-specific rna phages by the purification and concentration steps was 73
 50 n  16 no trends were observed between the sample volume
processed and phage recovery the nonenveloped f-specific rna phages may overestimate the
recovery efficiency of the enveloped sars-cov-2 ye et al18 showed
that ultrafiltration recovered 55 of ms2 a f-specific rna phage spiked to raw
wastewater compared to 25 for the murine coronavirus model studies by these authors
estimated that 26 of the murine coronavirus absorbed to wastewater solids compared to 6
for ms2 which would partially explain the lower recovery efficiency they observed for the
coronavirus this implies that a proportion of the sars-cov-2 virus particles may have
been present in the particulate fraction that was removed by the centrifugation step the
recovery efficiency of the rna extraction and qrt-pcr combined was evaluated in 16 samples
with the internal control ic rna supporting information and showed a recovery of 304  223 also
here no trend was observed between the recovery and volume of sample processed the
slopes of the standard curves for the quantification of the n-gene assays were
329  012 for n1 348  014 for n2 and 347 
011 for n3 respective y-intercept values were 4244  046 4388  019 and
4324  057 and amplification efficiencies were 985  13 943  52
and 943  41 for the n1 n2 and n3 quantification with a correlation coefficient
of 0997  0002 0992  0009 and 0987  0015 the results of the
qrt-pcr assays are presented without correcting for recovery efficiencies reliable
quantification of sars-cov-2 with qrt-pcr in sewage will be required to make reliable
covid-19 surveillance via sewage feasible therefore further development of controls to
consistently monitor coronavirus recovery efficiency of the concentration and
purification rna extraction and qrt-pcr is of great importance here nonenveloped f
rna phages were used which may overestimate the recovery efficiency of enveloped
viruses18 the analyses of an added quantified suspension of another
coronavirus such as mouse hepatitis virus18 to the sewage samples can
potentially be a feasible control to improve quantification reference materials for
qrt-pcr quantification would allow both intra- and interlaboratory comparison of qrt-pcr
results also digital droplet pcr could aid in the quantification of sars-cov-2 in water
as shown for other rna viruses19 the results of the samples of february 6 2020 3 weeks before the first case was
reported in the netherlands on february 27 showed no positive signals for primer sets
n1n3 and e table 1a the samples of
march 4 and 5 1 week into the epidemic showed a positive signal for all primerprobe

gcml den haag produced a signal with three qrt-pcr assays at 1222 gcml on
march 4 but was negative again on march 5 table 1b schiphol was positive for n1 and n3 2612 gcml and amersfoort
for n3 66 gcml march 15 and 16 all qrt-pcr targets produced a signal at each of the

positive for each of the assays at 261800 gcml table 1d high resolution electrophoresis with a bioanalyzer confirmed
that the length of the pcr products match the length of the pcr target gene fragments the
three n-gene assays ideally yield similar quantitative results the n2 and n3 assays
produced rna concentrations that differed by only 019  012 log10 gcml while n1
deviated more difference n1n2 037  016 log10 gcml n1n3 040

the primerprobe sets of n1  n3  n2 on sars-cov-2 rna20 looking
at the samples of march 4 and 5 when signal strength was low the n1 and n3 assays each
picked up sars-cov-2 rna in three wwtp and n2 in two wwtp the cumulative number of reported covid-19 cases in each of the cities served by the wwtp
figure 1 shows how the number of reported
cases increased at different rates in each of the cities as the epidemic spread tilburg
reported the most cases followed by utrecht and amsterdam the latter particularly from
march 18 onward the number of cases at the airport could not be estimated as the number
of covid-19 cases were not reported for this denominator the concentration of sars-cov-2 rna in sewage of each of the cities was compared to the
reported cumulative prevalence of covid-19 in the study period in the same city virus
shedding in stools of cases with mild or severe symptoms was reported to continue for 3 to
4 weeks after symptom onset and virus rna concentration in these stools were higher in
weeks three and four than in week two21 therefore it was considered
appropriate to use the cumulative prevalence per city for this four week study period
this provided a rough estimate of the cumulative prevalence of covid-19 since the service
areas of the wwtp do not precisely overlap with the city boundaries the sars-cov-2 rna
concentration as measured in the wwtp inlets for each of the monitoring days was plotted
against the cumulative prevalence observed on that day in that city figure 2 for each of the qrt-pcr assays an increase in the
sars-cov-2 rna concentration was observed as the number of reported covid-19 cases
increased combining data from all cities and all monitoring days the slope of the
increase was 062 log10 gene copies per log10 reported cases standard error se  012

n3 the slopes of n1 and n2 were impacted by the rna concentrations at the prevalence of

copy concentrations were available the cumulative prevalence was plotted against the
observed cycle threshold value the slope was 317 ct value per log10 reported
cases se  046 r2  077 p  0001
figure 2d even though there is a clear and
significant correlation for each of the qrt-pcr assays there is scatter in the combined
data of all the wwtp this may be caused by variations in virus rna recovery in the
detection method and variations in rna concentration in wastewater as well as by
variations in policies for virus testing in clinical samples between cities changes in
testing policy over the duration of the study has likely reduced the slopes in figure 2 each week the epidemic progressed more
people were tested not enough data were available to normalize the reported prevalence by
the number of tests per week the absence of positive qrt-pcr assays in sewage samples 3
weeks before covid-19 was first reported in the netherlands the detection of fragments of
two genes of sars-cov-2 in sewage of multiple wwtp in a temporal pattern that aligns with
the emergence of the epidemic in the netherlands and the observed significant correlation
between the rna concentration in sewage and the cumulative prevalence of covid-19 provide
compelling evidence that sars-cov-2 rna is detected in sewage it also indicates that
sewage surveillance of sars-cov-2 rna could be a tool for monitoring trends in covid-19
prevalence in cities which is very valuable information to support social distancing
policies to substantiate this relation between virus rna concentration in sewage and
covid-19 prevalence more precise quantification of virus rna in sewage and of covid-19
cases in the cities is needed and more data are needed per city and at different cities
and towns for the e gene assay translation to gene copy per ml is underway the
development of the sars-cov-2 rna concentration in sewage will be monitored as the
epidemic progresses to determine if sewage surveillance continues to follow the
epicurve the detection of n3 in wwtp amersfoort on march 5 when no cases had been reported in
amersfoort suggests virus circulation in the population before covid-19 cases are
reported through the health surveillance system the first two cases in amersfoort were
reported on march 11 so the sewage signaled virus circulation in amersfoort 6 days
before the first cases were noted figure 2 shows
that the n and e assays started to produce signals in sewage samples when the observed
covid-19 prevalence was around or even below 10 case in 100000 people given the
roughness of the prevalence estimates these numbers are indicative but do indicate that
sewage surveillance with the method used in this study is sensitive other authors have reported on sars-cov-2 rna in city sewage2224 in brisbane 0019012 gene copies per ml were
detected23 and wu et al24 reported 10240
gene copies per ml in boston ahmed et al23 estimated that the
concentrations in sewage matched with the prevalence in brisbane but wu et al24 suggested that their concentrations implied a much higher covid-19
prevalence 015 than reported 0026 however an absolute comparison
between prevalence of people infected with sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-2 rna concentration in
sewage may prove difficult since the reported prevalence depends heavily on the policy and
method of clinical testing the testing policy in the netherlands focused on people with a
travel history to hubei or italy people with severe symptoms and healthcare workers a
study among healthcare workers in the netherlands indicated that sars-cov-2 was already
circulating undetected in the community a week prior to february 27 when the first
covid-19 case was reported suggesting that there is a high prevalence of mild covid-19 in
the community25 recent serological surveys in the netherlands and
elsewhere show that the percentage of people that have been infected with covid-19 is much
higher than reported through clinical surveillance and is in the range of
11426 while absolute estimates of covid-19 prevalence
based on sars-cov-2 rna concentrations in sewage are complex our data suggest that
surveillance of relative changes in sars-cov-2 rna concentrations at the inlet of wwtp
over time can serve as a sensitive tool for early warning for increasing virus circulation
in the population  coronavims infection in acute lower respiratory tract disease of infants kenneth mcintosh ru chao kwa helen krause e raymond wash hilda mocega e maurice mufson a   a serologic surveillance of lower respiratory tract disease in 417 hospitalized children under 18 months of age revealed infection with coronaviruses strains oc43 andor 229e in 34 82 during the same interval one of 13 control infants was infected there were two distinct periods lasting six and 14 weeks respectively during which the incidence rose to as high as 189 of patients with lower respiratory tract disease the incidence of coronavirus infection in patients with pneumonia and bronchiolitis was higher than the incidences of adenoviruses influenza parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 2 and rhinoviruses and lower only than the incidences of parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus coronaviruses serologically similar or identical to strain 229e were recovered from frozen nasal washes obtained during the acute phase of pneumonia in two children continuing programs of surveillance during the past decade have provided evidence that viral infection is the major identifiable cause of acute lower respiratory tract disease lrtd in children nevertheless in every published study between one-third and two-thirds of serious illnesses cannot be associated with infection by known viruses 1 2 3 4  when the human coronaviruses were first discovered 5 6 7 and were shown to be of importance in upper respiratory disease in adults 8 9  it was hoped that they might account for a proportion of these unexplained illnesses however a seroepidemiologic study of their role in lrtd showed no statistically significant correlation with illness 8  nevertheless in the youngest group examined children less than one year received for publication march 1 1974  and in revised form july 19 1974 this work was supported in part by contracts no ph 43-63-76 and nih 72-2501

suggestion that coronaviruses might playa small but definite part in the etiology of bronchiolitis and pneumonia because of the great difficulty in cultivation of coronaviruses in vitro no attempts were made in these studies to corroborate serologic data with recovery of virus indeed to our knowledge coronaviruses have not previously been isolated from young children because of this paucity of information and because of the suggestive evidence that infants might be subject to lower respiratory infections with coronaviruses we undertook an examination of coronavirus infections in children less than 18 months old who were admitted to cook county hospital with acute lrtd conventional studies of respiratory virus in this group of children have been reported elsewhere 4  patients children less than 18 months old admitted on sunday through friday mornings to cook county hospital in chicago were included in the study they were housed in a single ward and were tested for shedding of virus within 24 hr of admission acute and convalescent sera were obtained from every child the diagnostic definitions in this study were 502 113 77 results 249 49 13137 95 10143 70 988 102 34417 82 corona

and subcostal retractions expiratory wheezes and often rales in laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis there was a harsh croupy cough with stridor and bronchitis was used to define a lesser disease with cough rhonchi and sometimes wheezing control children with adequate serum samples were few such infants were admitted for noninfectious disorders and had not experienced an acute respiratory illness during the previous 10 days virologic methods conventional methods for recovery of virus and serodiagnosis have been described 4  these methods would detect infection by respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza viruses types 1 2 and 3 adenoviruses influenza virus types a and b and mycoplasmpneumoniae 10  in this study antibodies to three coronavirus serotypes were measured human coronavirus type 229e 6 cf antigen was made in l-132 cells 11  strain oc43 antigen 7 was produced in brains of suckling mice 12  hemagglutination inhibition was measured with chicken erythrocytes as described by kaye and dowdle 13  a multivalent cf antigen containing four serotypes of mouse hepatitis virus microbiological associates bethesda md was included in our tests because of the known antigenic relationship of mouse hepatitis virus to the human coronaviruses 14 15 and because of its demonstrated capacity to react with antibodies to coronavirus in human sera 16  we attempted recovery of coronavirus from frozen oropharyngeal swab specimens obtained from selected children during acute illness with serologic evidence of 229e infection specimens were thawed and inoculated onto roller-tube monolayers of the human embryonic intestine fibroblast cell line ma-177 microbiological associates  this line previously had exhibited unusual sensitivity in the recovery of 229e-like viruses 17  material from the first or second passage was then transferred to and further propagated in wi-38 cells unconcentrated sonicates from infected roller-tube cultures were stained with phosphotungstic acid and examined in an rca emu-4a electron microscope 503 epidemiology of corona virus infection during the study period 417 children with acute lrtd were examined for serologic evidence of coronavirus infection only 13 serum pairs from control patients were available during this period but these had an age distribution proportionally similar to that of the lrtd serum pairs about 80 of the children were under one year old more than 90 of the infants were black coronavirus infection was detected serologi-callby a fourfold or greater rise in antibody in 34 ifants 82 of all those with acute lrtd and iii one of the 13 control infants the incidence of infection in relation to age is shown in table 1 there is some evidence that the youngest group shown those under two months old were infected less often than older children the seasonal incidence of acute lrtd and of coronavirus infection is shown in figure 1  numbers of hospital admissions for patients with acute lrtd show the expected peaks during the winter months coronavirus infections tended to occur in small outbreaks but with little seasonal preference this finding is in contrast to most other studies which have shown distinct increases in coronavirus infections in the winter and early spring 8 18  two periods of increased coronavirus incidence occurred table 2  both small outbreaks involved infants who had either pneumonia 6 or bronchiolitis 1 2  during both these periods infections with coronavirus were more common than those due to oteriruses te first period followed a large epidemic of respiratory syncytial virus but during the two months of coronavirus activity only 89  of the children were infected with respiratory syncytial virus during the second period there were cases of respiratory syncytial virus influenza a and parainfluenza types 1 and 3 but none of these individual viruses was found in more than 116 of infants whereas 163 of the infants had coronavirus infections 3 coronavirus infection in pneumonia and bronchiolitis table 4 ranks in incidence higher than adenovirus parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 2 influenza a and rhinovirus and lower than respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza type 3 clinical aspects of pneumonia and bronchiolitis associated with coronavirus infection of the 30 infants with coronavirus infection during bronchiolitis or pneumonia 13 were simultaneously infected with one or more other viruses however the single infections did not differ clinically from the multiple infections eighteen children required oxygen or were thought to be in respiratory distress with intercostal retractions vomiting occurred in nine infants and otitis media shared serologic activity among the human coronaviruses the rises in antibody to coronaviruses in paired sera of infants are analyzed in detail in table 5 all such rises were reproduced in replicate testing or were eightfold or greater serologic responses were shared between oc43 and mouse hepatitis virus in seven serum pairs crossreactivity between oc43 and 229e was found in five infants it is of interest that the seven infants included in the first outbreak of coronavirus described in table 2 all showed infection with 229e alone at other times the character of the rises in antibody to coronavirus was more heterogeneous recovery of coronaviruses from infants with acute lrtd frozen oropharyngeal swab specimens from nine infants with serologic evidence of infection with 229e alone were thawed and inoculated onto ma-177 monolayers seven specimens were from children involved in the outbreak in february and march 1967 despite multiple blind passages of these specimens and despite the appearance of suggestive cytopathic changes at certain passage levels consistent cpe failed to develop note infants were considered positive if virus was recovered or if there was serologic evidence of infection 231 infants with pneumonia and 149 infants with bronchiolitis were tested some infants were positive for more than one virus specimens from two infants ages one and two months hospitalized with pneumonia on august 11 and august 28 1967 yielded cytopathic agents on second blind subpassage the table 4  relative incidence of various respiratory virus infections in infants with pneumonia or bronchiolitis of the two isolates of virus strain 1428 detected rises in antibody in nine serum pairs that exhibited rises to strain 229e cf antigen and to no other viral antigens tested the two homologous serum pairs were included coronavirus infections are common in young children hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis ranking in frequency only behind respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza type 3 infection this high rate of prevalence clearly does not constitute proof that coronaviruses are causes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants indeed infection might have been incidental to lrtd caused by another agent in the one previous study that examined this problem 8 infections in control children were common but the number of such children in the group aged less than 18 months was as in the present study too small to be of significance and the suitability of the control group was also in question in the absence of statistically valid data therefore other considerations are of importance two aspects of this study are unique and provide some argument for the etiologic importance of coronaviruses in lrtd in infants first two small outbreaks ie circumscribed periods of increased incidence of coronavirus infection were defined in both coronavirus infections were clearly more common than those due to other respiratory viruses in the first outbreak children infected with strain 229e showed no evidence of infection with other respiratory viruses including other serotypes of human coronavirus in the second despite activity of several common respiratory viruses coronaviruses were predominant second coronavirus strains were recovered from two children during the acute stage of pneumonia the strains were antigenically similar or identical to strain 229e and antibody responses to these strains were demonstrated in the homologous paired sera these two recoveries of coronavirus are the first reported from infants further studies to identify the role of coronaviruses in infant lrtd seem indicated at the present time their role is uncertain the present study provides data that may implicate coronaviruses in at least a portion of pneumonia and bronchiolitis of young children the pathogenicity of coronaviruses which has been demonstrated in adults beyond reasonable doubt by studies in volunteers 19  is more difficult to prove in children it is likely that as techniques for recovery and recognition of coronavirus are improved and as other coronavirus serotypes are discovered infection will be found more frequently and the etiologic role of coronaviruses in lr td of children will be better defined  machine

andras fittler tim mackey vidya purushothaman jiawei li neal shah matthew nali cortni bardier bryan liang mingxiang cai raphael cuomo   as of the beginning of june 2020 the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic has now reached over 6 million confirmed cases worldwide over 17 million in the united states alone and approximately 370000 deaths worldwide according to the johns hopkins university coronavirus resource center covid-19 case counts are alarming in both their volume and widening geographic scope there are also concerns about the accuracy of reported covid-19 case counts particularly at earlier stages of the pandemic and whether underreporting may have obscured the true extent of the outbreak its underlining epidemiological characteristics and its overall health and societal impact 1-3 specifically concerns regarding covid-19 underreporting are influenced by factors such as lack of access to testing kits a lag in reporting and registering cases due to overburdened health systems failure to report or test before or after a covid-19-suspected death variation in testing administration or decision making eg foregoing testing when it would not change the course of treatment for a patient and uncomplicated mild or asymptomatic cases simply never being tested or seeking care 45 concerns about underreporting have been pervasive with media reports highlighting challenges in countries with outbreaks of different scale and at varying time periods including the united states china iran and russia to name a few 6-9 accurate estimations of the number of people who have recovered from covid-19 are also difficult to ascertain the john hopkins university coronavirus resource center covid-19 data dashboard is one source that aggregates the number of reported covid-19 recovered cases which now stands at over 26 million worldwide however case reporting on recoveries can be difficult to measure and define leading to potential overestimation of the mortality rate and underestimation of community spread that can complicate efforts toward estimating population immunity 5 reflecting these challenges covid-19 recovered cases are often limited to data aggregated at the country or national level are derived only from confirmed cases and may differ based on the definition of recovery or method of confirmation 510 in response this study sought to better understand the characteristics of publicly available self-reported user-generated conversations associated with terms that could be related to covid-19 symptoms recoveries and testing experiences this was accomplished using a retrospective observational infoveillance study during earlier stages of the global pandemic infoveillance studies which use data from the internet social media and other information in an electronic medium for disease surveillance purposes have been used in prior outbreaks eg h1n1 ebola 11-15 there is also an emerging base of literature using social media and website search results to explore the covid-19 pandemic 16-21 this retrospective infoveillance study was conducted in two phases 1 data collection using the public streaming twitter application programming interface api for covid-19-related keywords and 2 data cleaning processing and analysis of tweets using an unsupervised machine learning approach by means of natural language processing followed by subsequent statistical and geospatial analysis of twitter message characteristics we first collected tweets by filtering for general covid-19-related keywords including covid19 corona coronavirus coronavid19 following the collection of a corpus of general covid-19 tweets we further filtered this corpus for terms that could be associated with covid-19 symptoms testing and recovery conversations these additional terms included diagnosed pneumonia fever test testing kit sharing symptoms isolating cough er emergency room and emergency room the covid-19-related keywords were chosen based on relevance to general covid-19 social media conversations as used in prior studies 161822 filtered terms were chosen based on manual searches conducted by the study team prior to the commencement of the study where user-generated tweets associated with covid-19 symptoms were detected and the terms used were assessed data was collected from the twitter public api from march 3-20 2020 for data processing we first removed hashtags stop words and the top 100 news twitter handles or accounts we removed the top news accounts as the focus of this study was on user-generated content both first- and secondhand accounts of covid-19 experiences not covid-19 news and media sources of information for data analysis we used the biterm topic model btm an unsupervised machine learning approach to extract themes from groups of texts as used in prior studies to detect substance abuse disorder and other public health issues 23-25 groups of messages or text containing the same word-related themes are categorized into clusters the main themes of those clusters are considered as the topic of the text aggregation which is then split into a bag of words where a discrete probability distribution for each theme is generated 26 using btm we identified topic clusters with word groupings frequencies and characteristics that appeared to be related to symptoms recovery and testing experiences with covid-19 signal and then extracted tweets from these topic clusters for manual annotation the number of topic clusters we chose to extract k can affect the results associated with these topics too many clusters could lead to diffusion of signal while too few clusters may conceal possible signals in the topics to address this we used a coherence score to measure the quality of the number of topics we chose by measuring how correlated the texts are in the same clusters a higher coherence score means the text in the cluster are more correlated to each other we chose five different k values for the number of clusters k510152025 then we calculated the coherence score and identified the k value with the highest score as a parameter for btm here is how we calculate the u-mass coherence score ctvt we let dv be the document frequency of the word type v ie the number of documents containing at least one token of type v and dv v0 be the codocument frequency of word types v and v0 ie the number of documents containing one or more tokens of type v and at least one token of type v0 we define topic coherence as 

 vt   is a list of the m most probable words in topic t a smoothing count of 1 is included to avoid taking the logarithm of zero manual annotation of tweets was conducted by authors vp ns mn and cb coding was focused on content analysis using an inductive coding scheme including a binary classification of whether the tweet discussed symptoms that could be related to covid-19 including firsthand or secondhand accounts experiences with seeking covid-19 testing access or disease recovery and the co-occurrence of these themes see multimedia appendix 1 for description of coding schema vp ns mn and cb coded posts independently and achieved high intercoder reliability kappa098 for inconsistent results authors reviewed and conferred on correct classification with author tm data collection and analysis was conducted using the python python software foundation programming language and associated package tweepy statistical and geospatial analysis was carried out using rstudio 361 rstudio inc and arcgis esri for statistical analysis and geospatial visualization covid-19 cases from march 20 2020 were obtained from the jhu github cssegisanddata file ethics approval and consent to participate was not required for this study all information collected from this study was from the public domain and the study did not involve any interaction with users users indefinable information was removed from the study results a total of 72922211 tweets were collected from march 3-20 2020 from the twitter public api filtered for general covid-19-related keywords from this entire corpus we filtered for the previously mentioned additional terms associated with covid-19 symptoms testing and recovery conversations resulting in a filtered data set of 4492954 tweets ie this data set included tweets with both covid-19 general terms and at least one additional term btm was then used to analyze the filtered data set to identify relevant topic clusters after identifying topic clusters that had characteristics related to signal we extracted 35786 tweets contained in these btm topic clusters for the purposes of manual annotation ie this data set represents all tweets that were contained in relevant btm topic clusters selected for manual labelling after removing duplicates and manually annotating tweets 3465 000077 of the filtered data set posts from 2812 unique users were confirmed and identified as signal conversations related to symptoms testing experiences or recovery that users associated with covid-19 ie this data set represents true positives that were identified by manual annotation signal tweets were grouped into five main thematic categories 1 firsthand and secondhand eg family friends reporting of suspected symptoms that users associated with covid-19 eg fever cough shortness of breath chills 2 symptom reporting with concurrent discussion of lack of access to covid-19 testing mostly due to rigorous criteria to qualify for testing eg symptom severity fever travel history insurance and with no confirmatory diagnosis 3 user discussion of recovery from suspected covid-19 symptoms 4 user confirmation of a negative covid-19 diagnosis after receiving testing and 5 users recalling symptoms in the past 5 months that they suspected as possibly associated with a covid-19 infection see deidentified examples in table 1 metadata associated with users from these signal tweets indicated that the majority of these conversations were most likely organic ie originating and consisting of user-generated content though we did not explicitly filter our tweets for bot or spam traffic the average ratio of users followers to following was 160778 and only 111 users had accounts created recently in 2020 we also observed during our manual coding that these accounts generally included longer interactions with other users original content and profile information that had individually identifiable information or biographies generally these user metadata characteristics are reflective of organic content versus automated and social bot-based content in addition to content analysis we assessed posts for descriptive longitudinal and geospatial trends by analyzing time stamps and location for the subset of tweets that were geotagged posts exhibited longitudinal trends with an overall increase during the study period with noticeable rapid increases from march 3-6 2020 and an uneven but gradual increase thereafter figures 1 and 2 out of the 35786 extracted tweets from the btm topic clusters 1769 494 included geospatial coordinates compared to 522958 071 and 22048 049 tweets that had coordinates in the entire corpus and the term-filtered data set respectively hence our total corpus is similar to other studies reporting that approximately 1 of all tweets were geotagged and our btm topic cluster output had an overall higher volume of geolocated tweets in its sample 2728 from a global standpoint 649 n1125 originated from the united states followed by the united kingdom n228 132 canada n52 30 india n52 30 and australia n43 25 the high presence of us-based tweets and tweets from countries where the majority language is english with the exception of india is likely reflective of our sampling methodology which focused on english-language tweets and the fact that the highest proportion of twitter users are located in the united states this skewed geographic global distribution of tweets has also been explored in other studies that found a small number of countries led by the united states that account for a large share of the total twitter user population 29 the practical implications of this us-skewed geotagging mean that it is likely difficult to infer geospatial trends for tweets on specific covid-19-related topics for other countries unless data collection is more targeted eg collection of tweets in foreign languages in a specific time zone or targeting geotagging for country or region-specific shapefiles from a national perspective the us states with the most tweets associated with covid-19 symptoms and disease experiences were california n165 texas n126 new york n88 and illinois n54 which largely follows the most populous states in the country with the exception of florida manual coding revealed a similar ranking of symptom-related tweets that mentioned a state or city as self-reported by the user california n43 new york n33 texas n31 and georgia n16 even though these tweets had the highest frequency in larger states smaller states and states that had reported confirmed covid-19 cases eg washington state were also detected overall covid-19 associated symptom tweets exhibited wide distribution of twitter user locations including many in areas with high levels of population-normalized covid-19 confirmed case counts figure 3 spearman correlations were also computed between the following variables associated with tweets collected conversations about symptom reporting experiences with lack of testing recovery from suspected symptoms and us location to assess co-occurrence of detected themes statistically significant positive correlations exceeding r03 were observed between tweets that included users self-reporting symptoms and experiences with lack of testing r033 p001 as well as self-reporting of symptoms and self-reported recovery from reported symptoms r045 p001 this study identified tweets that included both first- and secondhand self-reporting of symptoms lack of access to testing and discussion of recovery that users associated with possible covid-19 the total volume of these covid-19 conversations increased over the time of the study particularly between march 3 and march 6 2020 also corresponding with a period that saw an increase in the number of confirmed cases in the united states the majority of these conversations related to first- or secondhand reporting of symptoms users associated with covid-19 with a subset of this group concurrently reporting that they could not get access to testing despite having covid-19-related symptoms other topics that occurred in lower frequency included self-reported recovery from symptoms users confirming they were not covid-19 positive and past accounts of symptoms users believed could have been undetected cases of covid-19 dating back as early as november 2019 correlation analysis of themes generated by different tweets analyzed for this study found that it was more likely that users who self-reported symptoms they associated with covid-19 would also concurrently report experiences with lack of access to testing or recovery from said symptoms these results indicate that the publics lived experience with covid-19 included uncertainty about whether they or others were infected with covid-19 frustration that they could not get tested to confirm these concerns and sometimes their recovery experience from these symptoms however this study was not able to confirm if users reporting these experiences were actually covid-19 cases and users may similarly have not tweeted if they had eventually received confirmatory testing or otherwise if there was a change in their condition importantly ascertaining accurate case estimations of the covid-19 outbreak is critical to ensuring health care system capacity is not overburdened evaluating the impact of public health interventions better enabling comprehensive contact tracing including methods of digital contact tracing ensuring the accuracy and predictability of covid-19 disease mathematical modeling and assessing the real-world needs for covid-19 treatment medical equipment diagnostics and other supplies 3031 other online tools such as the website covid near you 32 have collected self-reported symptom and testing access data directly from the public to better inform these case estimations relatedly the value of our study is in its innovative approach using data mining in combination with modeling to sift through a large volume of unstructured data to detect and characterize potential underreported cases of covid-19 the methodology has particular utility for new and emerging topics such as a novel infectious disease outbreak where an existing training or labelled data set is not available for machine learning classification tasks specifically our study tapped into an existing publicly available data source to help characterize conversations from twitter users about their self-reported experiences with covid-19 and provides insight into one period of this evolving and rapidly spreading global pandemic it is our hope that this study can help inform future infoveillance efforts supplement traditional disease surveillance approaches and advance needed innovation to improve the scope and accuracy of future disease outbreak case estimations for covid-19 and future health emergencies this study has limitations we only collected data from one social media platform and limited study keywords and additional filtered terms to the english language this likely biased study results to english speakers and primarily english-speaking countries particularly since the highest number of twitter users are already located in the united states in fact in our final data set of signal tweets we did not observe any conversations in languages other than english our keywords and filtered terms were also chosen on the basis of our own manual searches on the platform but may not have been inclusive of all twitter conversations related to the study aims future studies should expand data collection and analysis approaches to different languages and phrases associated with covid-19 symptoms testing and recovery to obtain a more worldwide representative corpus of social media conversations we also did not cross-validate the veracity of user-generated comments with other data sources eg confirmed case reports additional survey data death certificates data on other diseases with similar symptoms or electronic medical records future studies should explore combining multiple data layers from different sources to better validate whether user-generated self-reporting is highly associated with confirmed cases case clusters and disease transmission trends using traditional syndromic and other infoveillance approaches while also controlling for seasonal incidence of symptomatically similar diseases upper respiratory infections pneumonia and flu or influenza additionally though we used data filtering and btm to more efficiently analyze a large corpus of tweets we nevertheless relied on manual annotation to confirm whether tweets contained a signal this was particularly important to remove false positives generated by our btm outputs ie the word testing can take on different meaning depending on the context of a conversation future studies should also focus on developing feature-based supervised machine learning classifiers based on identified conversation characteristics reported in this study to detect self-reported covid-19 experiences with symptoms testing and recovery specifically supervised models that can leverage validated training sets are likely to have a much higher performance in terms of precision and recall compared to the use of topic models used in this study and could likely achieve classification closer to real time given that accurate case estimations are more effective when they are timely and can be acted upon quickly these future approaches would likely have more utility in aiding with unreported case detection identifying potentially vulnerable or at-risk populations and better elucidating the publics lived experiences with covid-19  intraruminal administration of milk in the calf as a model for ruminal drinking

129-140 in order to develop a calf model for studying the syndrome of ruminal drinking kd in veal calves three dual-fistulated calves were used to test the effect of intraruminal administration of milk replacer on the jejunal mucosa biopsies of the proximal jejunal mucosa were taken through a jejunal fistula and the mucosal morphology and the activities of two brush border enzymes lactase and alkaline phosphatase were determined means of villus length and brush border enzyme activities decreased during the period of intraruminal administration of milk the hyperplastic villus atrophy in this model was similar to that found in chronic rd patients in previous studies this could not be associated with isolation of pathogenic micro-organisms from the faeces and is probably the consequence of the intraruminal milk feeding procedure itself clinical recovery from the signs of rd occurred rapidly after intraruminal administration of milk ceased and was followed by restoration of villus length and brush border enzyme activities 3-4 weeks later  ruminal drinking rd calves are known to have an insufficient reticular groove reflex while drinking milk this causes deposition of a substantial amount of milk into the rumen breukink et al 1988  during the retention of this milk in the rumen fermentation takes place and volatile fatty acids and lactate are produced a distinct reduction in ph is also noticed van weeren-keverling buisman et al 1990  at necropsy of chronic rd calves hyperkeratosis of the rumen is found van bruinessen-kapsenberg et al 1982 breukink et al 1988

border enzyme deficiency de visser and breukink 1984  the purpose of this study was to determine the influence of intraruminal administration of milk on the morphology of the villi of the proximal jejunum information about the functional capacity of the small intestinal epithelium was obtained by determining the activities of the brush border enzymes lactase and alkaline phosphatase ai three clinically normal male friesian holstein calves e h and s were used the housing and feeding regimens were as described by van weeren-keverling buisman et al 1990  they were fed commercial milk replacer twice a day and no additional solid food was given in week 4 of the fattening period a cannula was placed in the proximal jejunum under general anaesthesia van weeren-keverling buisman et al 1988b  procain penicillin 10 000 ivkg and dihydrostreptomycin 10 mgkg were administered intramuscularly twice daily for four days postoperatively a rumen cannula was placed under general anaesthesia during week 6 van weeren-keverling buisman et al 1990 and this was followed by 20 mgkg intravenous sodium ampicillin every 8 h for 24 h this second cannula was used for the intraruminal administration of milk the experiment was divided into three periods the pre-induction period the induction period and the recovery period in the pre-induction period weeks l-6 during which both operations took place a commercial milk replacer tentofeed i tentego bv mijdrecht the netherlands containing 235 protein mainly skim milk powder 165 fat 73 ash and 429 lactose was administered by an open bucket in the induction period from week 7 onwards the milk replacer was administered intraruminally in increasing proportions until the faeces became clay-like in week 11 50 of the ration was infused into the rumen twice daily the remaining portion being fed from an open bucket in the recovery period the entire milk replacer diet was again consumed from an open bucket in calves h and s the induction period was five weeks in calf e the induction period was prolonged by two weeks during which time the percentage of intraruminally administered milk replacer was raised to 63 consequently the recovery period in this calf started two weeks later during all three periods milk replacer from the same batch of powder was fed the fast sample of the proximal jejunal mucosa was taken in week 4 of the fattening period during the insertion of the cannula from week 5 onwards jejunal biopsies were taken twice a week throughout all three experimental periods 40 to 70 cm caudally from the intestinal fistula using a crosby capsule lamis utrecht the netherlands van 19ssb  data obtained in the different experimental periods were compared within each calf the jejunal biopsies were fmed in 4 buffered formalin stereomicroscopic examination of all biopsies was carried out with a zeiss stereomicroscope at a magnification of 10-20x in order to determine the shape of the villi mouwen 1971  thin slices of the biopsies perpendicular to the mucosal surface were then embedded in paraffin and serial sections 5 pm in thickness were stained with haematoxylin and eosin the lengths of 10 full-length villi and crypts were measured with an ocular micrometer mouwen 1972  the same 10 crypts were used to determine the index of mitosis so as to indicate the proliferative status of the crypt epithelium the number of mitotic cells in metaphase and anaphase was counted and the total number multiplied by 100 was divided by the total crypt depth in pm the other jejunal biopsies one biopsy from each week were immediately frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen at -lc during the experimental period the biopsy was homogenized ika-thyristor speed controller tr50 janke and kunkel ika werk stauben frg for 3 min in 2 ml of buffer solution 50 mmoll mannitol and 2 mmoll tris at a ph of 71 in melting ice the homogenate was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 5 min at 4c eppendorf 5414s merck bv amsterdam the netherlands and the supernatant was stored at -70c for up to two days prior to analysis determination of the protein content in the supematant was carried out by the method of lowry et al 1951  the method for determining the lactase activity of the biopsies was first assessed using a commercially available lactase ec 32123 a mixture containing 005 ml of the 3-fold diluted supernatant in the same mannitol-buffer and 005 ml of lactose solution 300 mg5 ml was incubated at 37c for 40 min lactose hydrolysis was then ended by putting the mixture in ice the amount of glucose was measured by the gluco-quant method boehringer mannheim frg lactase activity was expressed in mm01 glucoseg protein alkaline phosphatase activity ar ec 3131 in the supernatant was determined calorimetrically by the optimized standard method boehringer mannheim frg on the multistat iii instrumentation laboratory benelux bv and expressed in ug protein throughout the experimental period a weekly sample of the faeces was taken directly from the rectum of each calf bacteriological examination for salmonella and pseudomonas was performed by direct isolation on modified brilliant green agar or after selective enrichment in sodium selenite-brilliant green-mannitol broth oxoid hampshire uk followed by an antimicrobial sensitivity test neo-sensitabs rosco taastrub denmark the samples were examined for cryptosporidia by the modified ziehl neelsen technique the presence of rotavirus was tested for by latex agglutination wellcome diagnostics dartford uk microbiologic diagnostic centre state university of utrecht virological examination for the presence of coronavirus in the faeccs was carried out using a double antibody-sandwich das elisa test from week 8 onwards central veterinary institute lelystad the netherlands serological examination for antibodies against rotavirus coronavirus and bovine diarrhoea virus bdv was performed by blocking elisa in weeks 5 and 15 a tube agglutination test with h and 0 antigen was done to detect antibodies against salmonella dublin and salmonella typhimurium central veterinary institute lelystad the netherlands in the induction period the faeces developed a clay-like consistency with greyish-white colour faeces with these characteristics typical for chronic rd calves were produced in week 10 by calves h and s and in week 13 by calf e during the recovery period the faeces of calves e and s regained their normal character within a few days in calf h recovery from the clinical signs of rd wdelayed for about three weeks after intraruminal administration of milk stopped in this calf clinical recovery was only achieved after modification of the feeding regimen by increasing the feeding frequency giving smaller meals and using a floating nipple the results of the microbiological examination of the weekly samples of the faeces are shown in table i  no sahnonellae were isolated during the entire experiment in weeks 5 and 7 other pathogens pseudomonas cryptosporidia rotavirus were isolated in all three calves in most cases no diarrhoea was observed from weeks 8 to 11 all the faecal samples were negative for potential pathogens and no diarrhoea was observed from weeks 12 to 15 pseudomonas rotavirus and coronavirus were again isolated diarrhoea was observed sporadically on a few days during the experiment only calf s experienced diarrhoea during the larger part of the recovery period in no case was there any need for treatment or adjustment of the feeding regimen pseudomonas species were found in large numbers in calf e from weeks 5 to 7 but were never associated with diarrhoea three of the six diarrhoeic samples from calf s contained pseudomonas all pseudomonas isolated were resistant to most of the antibiotics tested the antibody titre against both types of salmonella and bdv was negative in all three calves although the titre against rotavirus calves e and h and coronovirus calf s was unchanged or slightly elevated in week 15 compared to the titre in week 5 no seroconversion occurred in any calf the jejunal biopsies of the three experimental calves showed a mixture of finger-shaped and long tongue-shaped villi during the pre-induction period and the first part of the induction period in calves h and s from week 9 onwards these villus forms were replaced by predominantly long to short tongue-shaped villi with a few finger-and leaf-shaped ones in calf e this change was observed in week 13 only there was no essential change in villus form in the recovery period in calves h and s compared to that in the induction period the mean villus length and the individual values for calves e h and s respectively are given in figure 1  individual values are given because each calf serves as its own control the measurements are compared with the initial villus length in week 4 at the time of the frost operation in the pre-induction period all three calves exhibited a temporary decrease in villus length to 74 of the initial length which resolved in week 8 shortly after ruminal infusion of milk was initiated from weeks 10 to 15 the villus length was again reduced compared to the initial values the shortest villus length 41-47 of initial length were observed in all three calves during week 12 in week 15 during the recovery period all values had almost returned to their initial values crypt depth did not alter after intraruminal milk administration it ranged from 214 to 374 pm in the experimental calves the index of mitosis for each calf is given in table ii  peak values 2 100 were obtained in weeks lo-12 in calf e weeks 13-14 in calf h and weeks 13  16 in calf s the mean and individual lactase activities for the three experimental calves during the three experimental periods are presented in figure 2  the first measurements are from week 5 when the first biopsies were taken a substantial variation in lactase activity was observed during the experimental period although the activity in all three calves fell in weeks 7 and 12 to 28 and 19 respectively of their values in week 5 figure 3 the mean and individual ap activities for the three experimental calves are presented variation is less than with lactase activity but the low points in activity for both lactase and ap in weeks 7 and 12 were essentially the same ai activity was reduced to 44 in week 7 and to 34 in week 12 the use of an intestinal fistula by which repeated biopsies of the jejunal mucosa can be taken made it possible to compare within each calf the data obtained in the different periods this compensates for the individual morphological and functional variations the clinical signs of rd in this calf model were less obvious than in rd patients the typical clay-like faeces were only observed for a short period in the three experimental calves this may be the consequence of more rapid clearance of rumen contents in this calf model than in chronic rd patients van weeren-keverling buisman et al 1990  when considering the detection of pathogenic micro-organisms in the faeces two periods of excretion can be distinguished the first period weeks 5-7 was directly post-operative when pathogenic micro-organisms were found in 7 out of 9 samples of the faeces but only one calf s was diarrhoeic in week 7 this may be attributed to increased susceptibility in the surgically stressed animals post-operative antibiotic treatment or both ampicillin for instance is known to reduce colonization resistance maintained by the normal gut flora van der waay 1979 as a result of which pathogenic micro-organisms may start to colonize the intestine the second period of shedding of micro-organisms was from weeks 12-15 during the recovery period pseudomonas aentginosa rotavirus and coronavirus were isolated calf s suffered from slight diarrhoea during the larger part of the recovery period pseudomonas was present in 2 of the 5 faeces samples this is similar to observations in naturally occurring rd calves in which a period of diarrhoea is observed after initiation of reconditioning therapy in more than half of these cases pseudomonas were found in the faeces van weeren-keverling buisman et al 1988a  pseudomonas usually shows a multiresistant pattern towards antibiotics batra and garg 1987  pseudomonas ueruginosu is able to cause a haemorrhagic gastroenteritis in calves nilsson and thiirne 12 but clinically healthy intestinal carriers have also been reported in dairy calves and cows matthews and fitzsimmons 1 hoadley and mccoy 1968 batra and garg 1987  the incidence of pseudomonas intestinal carriage in veal calves is probably even higher due to frequent antibiotic treatment or to the subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics which are frequently added to the milk replacer hamstra and van haeringen 1977  no information is available about the pathological changes in the intestine in cases of subclinical pseudomonas infection rotavirus was detected in calf h in weeks 7 12 and 13 by the latex agglutination test but was not accompanied by diarrhoea coronavirus was detected only in the recovery period in calf e in week 14 and in calf h in week 15 rotavirus and coronavirus can both cause diarrhoea and villus atrophy in the jejunum of young calves under three weeks of age torres medina et al 1985  however in this experiment no pathogenic micro-organisms were shed during the period of intraruminal milk administration while the vilhrs length was decreasing gradually thus the observed vihus atrophy during the induction period is probably caused by another non-infectious factor resulting from the intraruminal administration of the milk the transitory decline in villus length shortly after the operations may be associated with the well-known relationship between surgery stress and the shedding of pathogens the observed vilhrs forms in the pre-induction period a mixture of finger-shaped and long tongue-shaped villi is the normal stereomicroscopic appearance for veal calves van weeren et az 1986  in the induction period these villus forms are replaced by long to short tongue-shaped villi with few finger-and leaf-shaped ones the index of mitosis was increased at the end of the induction period and the beginning of the recovery period although the crypt depth in the experimental calves did not change this indicates that the villus atrophy induced by intraruminal feeding is one of the hyperplastic type viius atrophy with hyper-regenerative crypt epithelium in chronic rd calves was also found in previous studies breukink et az 1988 van weeren-keverling bman et al 1988a  a reduced lactase activity compared to the initial values was found in all three experimental calves in week 12 at the end of the induction period a similar decrease in lactase activity was found in week 7 shortly post-operatively these changes in enzyme activity were accompanied by parallel changes in villas length and indicate a reduction in functional intestinal epithelium caused by immaturity or damage to the epithelial cells landsverk 1981  lactase is localized mainly in the brush border of the epithelium of the villi and the apical portions of the crypts in the proximal small intestine landsverk 1980  its function is the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose which are absorbed in the small intestine coombe and smith 1973  normally lactase activity is highest in very young calves huber et al ll and decreases with age toofanian et al 1974 observed a gradual decrease in activity during the first four weeks of life after that the lactase activity remained constant in calves up to 6 months old lactase activity is also influenced by the type of diet offered continuation of a liquid lactose-containing diet and prevention of the functional development of the rumen prevented the normal post-weaning decline in lactase activity toofanian et az 1974  supplementation of milk diets with extra lactose resulted in an even higher lactase activity huber et al 1964  the lactase activity in our study was therefore probably not only influenced by the observed villus atrophy but was also partly the result of a reduced amount of substrate in the rumen an unknown amount of lactose is converted into lactate and volatile fatty acids van weeren-keverling buisman et al 1990  comparison of the absolute values of lactase activity in our study with those found in the literature is difficult because of the differences in determination of enzyme activity a reduced lactase activity was reported in diarrhoeic calves between 10 and 30 days of age which also showed villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the proximal jejunum landsverk 1981  youanes and herdt 1987 reported similar results dargel and hartmann 1984 also found that lactase activity in diarrhoeic calves from 7 to 11 days of age was about half that of healthy calves of the same age a reduction in ap activity was observed at the same times as the reduction in lactase activity ie during weeks 7 and 12 restoration of the depressed activity of this enzyme after the induction period was somewhat delayed when compared with the lactase activity at the end of the recovery period in week 16 the ap activities of the experimental calves had almost completely regained their initial values this suggests that ap activity may also be influenced by villus atrophy alkaline phosphatase ap is a brush border enzyme with slight additional activity in the golgi apparatus landsverk 1980  it is mainly localized in the duodenum and proximal and mid jejunum landsverk 1980  where it is involved in energyconsuming sugar and lipid absorption stighnair-herb ef az 1986 it is not known if diet or age influence ap activity however in diarrhoeic calves up to 4 days of age with experimental escherichia coli and rotavirus infections ap activity is reduced stighnair-herb et al 1986  this reduction was also found in kweek-old calves with parasitic gastroenteritis benz and ernst 1986  in dogs with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth caused by aerobic flora such as enterococci and escherichiu coli ap activity was reduced while lactase activity and the activities of other brush border enzymes were not altered significantly this suggests that bacterial secretions or metabolites also specifically act on ap activity batt and hall 1989  it can be concluded that intraruminal administration of half the milk ration to normal veal calves results in clinical symptoms of rd and villus atrophy in the proximal jejunum this hyperplastic villas atrophy is similar to that found in chronic rd patients and is accompanied by a reduction in brush border enzyme activities clinical recovery is fast after returning to the normal feeding regimen with restoration of villus length and brush border enzyme activities in three to four weeks  the diagnostic value of detecting sudden smell loss among asymptomatic covid-19 patients in early stage the possible early sign of covid-19 yun kang jin jin cho hee min lee hyeong yeon kim ji chan-soon park   all over the world severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has been the most important public health issue this year recently this was re-named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who sars-cov-2 is also included in the coronavirus family along with sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 1 covid-19 was first reported in wuhan china 23 in december 2019 since then covid-19 has spread rapidly all over the world 4 and has killed more than 226000 people worldwide so far this rapid spread is suspected via not only human-to-human but also interspecies transmissions 5 the who declared a pandemic on march 11 according to the early studies the most common symptoms are known as fever cough difficulty in breathing sputum and sore throat 67 in fact however many patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms in early stages and so they do not realize being infected since covid-19 is highly contagious in early stages such lack of recognition can cause serious problems for the prevention of the spread of covid-19 therefore detection of covid-19 in early even asymptomatic stages will help us reduce transmission recently olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is often reported as a symptom 89 we need to pay more attention because the symptom might be easily overlooked in clinical field and so the diagnosis could be delayed in this review we reviewed recent findings of the viral infection-related olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions to identify a correlation between the olfactory or gustatory symptoms and corona virus and the values of olfactory dysfunction as an early sign of covid-19 even in asymptomatic patients we searched the articles using pubmed and embase the first keyword was viral infection coronavirus rhinovirus influenza covid sars or mers the second keyword was anosmia smell or olfactory the full search strategy has been reported in table table 1
 the articles that could not be obtained in the full text did not mention relationship between viral infection and olfactory function directly were not written in english and were the duplicated papers by the same author were excluded using endnote x9 software to date 23th april 2020 we could find 85 papers which mentioned viral infection and olfactory function among them 26 papers described relationship between olfactory symptoms and coronavirus infection including sars 40 papers described a relationship between olfactory symptoms and other viral infection including cytomegalovirus herpes virus influenza and others finally we could find 21 papers that directly described covid-19 and olfactory symptoms some of them also mentioned gustatory dysfunction or ageusia from these 21 papers 7 papers were clinical studies and others were commentary letters and editorial review fig 1
 the details of these 7 articles were demonstrated in table table 2
 a study reported patients who initially complained of acute onset anosmia not covid-19 infection but finally diagnosed with covid-19 infection 10 there were no restrictions for gender age and nationality the studies with inclusion criteria were checked independently by 2 reviewers reviewers apply inclusion criteria based on the title and abstracts if the title and abstract were adequate the full text was checked by the same reviewers the common symptoms in covid-19 patients were cough fever myalgia dyspnea headache and loss of appetite the most common ent symptoms were facial pain and nasal congestion 9 however it has been recently reported that 339 of 59 covid-19 patients in italy complained of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction and 11 complained of both dysfunctions 11 47 of 114 covid-19 patients in france complained anosmia 12 3165 and 3544 of 79 covid-19 patients in spain complained olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions these proportions were more prominent in covid-19 patients than influenza patients 13 according to the paper from usa reported that 68 and 71 of 59 patients had olfactory and gustatory dysfunction respectively 14 98 of 60 patients from iran were confirmed smell dysfunction by university of pennsylvania smell identification test upsit 15 and few articles said that covid-19 patients without severe symptoms complained these olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions according to the larger-scale research from europe 856 of the 417 mild-to-moderate covid-19 patients had olfactory dysfunctions and 888 gustatory dysfunctions phantosmia and parosmia were 126 and 324 respectively among the patients who did not complain of nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea the rates of anosmia and hyposmia were 662 and 135 9 from the other italian article 644 of 202 mild symptomatic covid-19 patients were reported alternations in smell or taste about 37 of them complained severe alternations 683 of covid-19 patients with smell or taste alternations reported fatigue and 346 reported nasal stuffiness 16 contrary to the above papers only 51 of 214 patients complained of hyposmia and 56 hypogeusia in china 8 considering the papers the rate of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is supposed to be different between europeusa and china or asia another issue is the onset of olfactory dysfunction which varied among many papers the onset of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in the clinical course of covid-19 might be important a multicenter study in europe showed that 856 and 88 of total patients n  417 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions respectively and 118 of covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction appeared before other general symptoms 654 after the general symptoms and 228 at the same time 9 in italy 203 of covid-19 patients reported olfactory dysfunction before other general symptoms and 135 during hospitalization 11 from the other study of italy 119 of covid-19 patients n  130 complained of smell or taste alternations prior to other symptoms and 267 after other symptoms 16 in iran 83 of 23 covid-19 patients with anosmia complained of anosmia as their primary symptom 17 in spain 355 among 31 covid-19 patients complained early and 677 showed acute onset of olfactory dysfunction 13 however according to another study from iran all of 21 covid-19 patients reported olfactory dysfunction with or immediately after the other general symptoms 15 in case of sars-cov infection complete anosmia was usually reported 3 weeks after the first symptom 18 the other issue is the correlation of olfactory dysfunctions with otolaryngologic symptoms the olfactory dysfunction is not closely correlated with nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea but it is supposed to be related to fever 9 in china only 4 of patients with olfactory dysfunction complained of rhinorrhea 19 and only 5 nasal stuffiness 20 from the recent survey study of 2428 patients with new onset anosmia in united kingdom 17 of anosmia patients had only anosmia without any other otolaryngologic symptoms however this survey has limited value because only 80 patients had been tested for covid-19 infection only 74 of the tested patients were positive and most of the responders were young 10 from a case report olfactory dysfunction was described as isolated sudden onset anosmia because a patient with confirmed covid-19 complained of sudden onset anosmia without any other symptoms 21 according to the other study from italy 3 of covid-19 patients n  130 reported smell or taste alternations as the sole symptom 16 however there is also an article reporting that ent symptoms can be accompanied by anosmia 12 in korea korean center for disease control kcdc recently on 6 april 2020 announced in a press release that proportion of asymptomatic case was 333 based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation of covid-19 10284 confirmed as positive among 466804 tested in republic of korea until 6 april 2020 22 there is a study showing that most of gustatory dysfunction appeared as an early symptom before hospitalization 11 besides there might be close correlation between olfactory and gustatory dysfunction p0001 9 considering above around 2030 covid-19 patients may present olfactory dysfunction andor gustatory dysfunction as early or sometimes isolated symptom of covid-19 curiously many studies showed that women had olfactory dysfunction more frequently than men 9111217 though the reason is hard to be explained at this time according to a recent study toll-like receptor tlr activation with cytokine production and protein phosphorylation is related to x chromosomes this might explain different inflammatory conditions and clinical courses after infection between men and women 23 however from another study the results of upsit checked olfactory function were same between men and women 15 further investigations of gender difference are needed globally particularly in europe the olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions of covid-19 patients were reported as new symptoms however to date many papers have reported that the olfactory dysfunction has also occurred by other viral infections over 200 different viruses 24 2526 furthermore coronavirus family including sars is also related to post-viral anosmia 18 although the exact mechanism is not yet known 2 basic mechanisms have been suggested first conductive olfactory dysfunction can be induced if there are some problems on olfactory cleft mucosa such as mucosa inflammation or rhinorrhea 27 olfactory dysfunction in viral infection with rhinovirus parainfluenza epstein-barr viruses and some other coronavirus can be explained however in some cases even if the acoustic rhinometry result was normal the olfactory function did not recover 28 olfactory dysfunction of covid-19 patients is also thought to be less related to rhinorrhea or nasal congestion second if there are direct effects by virus on olfactory cleft mucosa sensorineural olfactory dysfunction can be considered 29 direct mucosal infection by virus can cause severe injury of peripheral olfactory neuron which might have fetal effects on olfactory receptors 30 also both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 might have the potential of microinvasion to the target receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is expressed on the olfactory bulb and the epithelial cell of oral mucosa 31 however the effects of virus on sensorineural olfactory dysfunction are controversial from one study it claims that sars-cov might affect neurons in the olfactory bulb of mice and spread to the cortex basal ganglia and midbrain 32 on the other hand there is another case report of the sars-cov patients presenting with anosmia showed normal on brain magnetic resonance imaging mri scan 18 there is also a case of covid-19 patient who showed the bilateral inflammatory mucosal obstruction of the olfactory cleft without other abnormalities in nasal cavity and olfactory bulb on computed tomographic scan ct and mri scan 33 as mentioned earlier there are differences in the olfactory and otolaryngologic symptoms of chinese and european patients 19 and it might be due to the diversity and mutation of ace2 phenotypes 3435 the validated tests which could quickly and accurately diagnose the olfactory dysfunction in the highly suspicious covid-19 patients are needed the short version of the questionnaire of olfactory disorders negative statements sqod-ns can be used to assess the quality of life of the covid-19 patients with anosmia or hyposmia 9 the score was significantly lower in patients with anosmia than hyposmia or normosmia besides subjective questionnaires commonly used olfactory tests are as follows upsit cross-cultural smell identification test cc-sit sensonic inc haddon heights nj tt olfactometry test daiichi yakuhin sangyo tokyo japan and other olfactory threshold tests 36 recently few cases of covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction were confirmed by upsit there was no correlation between upsit result and awareness of olfactory dysfunction in covid-19 patients 15 also acoustic rhinometry rhinomanometry ct or mri could identify the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction mainly due to conductive problems and identify other causes however the usage of nasal endoscopy is not recommended in the highly suspicious covid-19 patients because it may provide other people unnecessary virus exposure 37 in general spontaneous recovery rates have been reported higher in post-viral patients than post-traumatic patients and there are no definite treatment guidelines in the post-viral patients presenting with olfactory or gustatory dysfunction including covid-19 there are 2 issues on anosmia treatment in covid-19 patients the first issue is that early anomia treatment in covid-19 patients can change clinical course of covid-19 but due to lack of information this issue is hard to be answered but early detection appears more likely to be meaningful rather than early treatment for covid-19 the second one is whether empirical oral steroid treatment for acute anosmia can do harm to covid-19 patients without any other symptom or with mild symptoms up to date several studies have shown that oral steroid treatment for anosmia by viral infection may be effective through reducing mucosal inflammation and edema 38 there is a controversy over the effectiveness of the use of empirical systemic corticosteroids because oral steroids may aggravate immunosuppressive state in the covid-19 patients with severe symptoms and there are studies showing that use of corticosteroids in mers patients may have affected the delay of rna reduction in mers coronavirus 39 moreover in cases of the covid-19 patients with severe lung complications the use of corticosteroids is not recommended by who guideline 40 in china however limited use of low dose corticosteroid during short-term can be permitted when absolutely necessary 41 according to the recently released aria eaaci statement it is recommended to keep using intranasal steroid ins in the covid-19 patients with allergic rhinitis 40 although it may be revised later with new studies it is also recommended to maintain the use of local intranasal corticosteroids because sneezing could get worse and the virus could spread easily if the patients stop using ins ins is supposed to have relatively less risky than systemic steroids because the rate of systemic bioavailability of ins is less than 1 42 but further studies are needed to confirm if ins may be effective for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction and for the change of clinical course in the covid-19 patients it was reported that the treatments used for olfactory dysfunction were nasal saline irrigations 167 nasal corticosteroids 81 oral corticosteroids 25 and others 25 however in actual clinical field most of the patients with olfactory dysfunction did not receive any treatment 9 olfactory training simple and easy can bring positive results on the recovery for anosmia by viral infection but there is no definite guideline for olfactory training in the covid-19 patients but a few papers recommend that early olfactory training before 12 months from the onset of anosmia could have positive results in the patients with anosmia and viral infection including covid-19 3743 besides steroid and olfactory training zinc sulfate theophylline ginkgo biloba vitamins nasal decongestants or other medicine could also be considered to treat olfactory dysfunction saline washing nasal saline irrigation should be considered carefully because it could make virus more contagious 9 however except for the corticosteroid the effects of other medicine have not been proven 37 most of the patients with gustatory dysfunction did not have any special treatment either using l-carnitine or vitamins 9 the recovery of olfactory function is relatively slower in sensorineural dysfunction than conductive olfactory dysfunction and permanent functional loss might be caused 21 there are a few studies for the recovery of olfactory function in covid-19 infected patients yet in usa 74 of 38 cured patients from covid-19 were reported to show the recovery of anosmia 14 in france mean duration of anosmia was within 2 weeks and 55 of 44 patients recovered more after 1week and 20 recovered more after 2 weeks in spain mean duration of anosmia was also within 2 weeks and 40 of 30 patients recovered completely around 1 week later 74  23 days 13 according to the study from europe a total of 357 patients 856 had olfactory dysfunction from a total of 417 covid-19 infected patients but among 59 clinically cured patients only 44 is reported to show the recovery of olfactory function in short term period within 14 days most of whom 726 of patients with recovered olfactory dysfunction showed a recovery within 8 days only a small number of patients 34 showed a recovery more than 15 days after the covid-19 resolution among the clinically cured patients who had residual olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction 539 complained of only olfactory dysfunction 225 only gustatory dysfunction and 236 both remaining olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions 9 the time to decide the recovery of olfactory function was suggested to be 2 weeks because the viral loading significantly reduces in about 14 days 944 but the further study requires to decide the time to recovery and follow up long term later considering from the other viral infections the partial or complete recovery of olfactory function could take several months 45 and in case of anosmia after sars the patient was reported to suffer from anosmia continuously more than 2 years 18 the ongoing covid-19 epidemic is still rapidly spreading all over the world so it is very important to notice the early sign of covid-19 and get the information about progression as soon as possible most of covid-19 patients complain of no symptoms or mild symptoms in early stages though coughing fever and difficulty breathing are main symptoms up to date the number of the covid-19 patients with olfactory andor gustatory symptoms is rapidly increasing and though the onset of olfactory andor gustatory symptoms in the covid-19 patients was reported varied in general most of these 2 symptoms might precede or be accompanied by other main mild general symptoms or no other symptoms 16 moreover many cases 182 have been reported for the covid-19 patients to complain of these 2 symptoms suddenly without any other otolaryngologic symptoms like rhinorrhea or nasal obstructions 9 based on the previous paper the rates of asymptomatic cases out of all sars-cov positive cases were reported 13 among singaporean health care workers 46 furthermore according to who report for mers-cov 21 of the 2228 cases from all over the world were reported to have no or mild symptoms 47 asymptomatic case proportion of covid-19 was 333 based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation which was higher than sars-cov and mers-cov according to kcdc report on 6 april 2020 22 therefore we should pay more attention to olfactory andor gustatory symptoms in the suspicious covid-19 patients with or without the main covid-19 symptoms because asymptomatic covid-19 infection andor transmission is a major public health issue at present however the exact rate of asymptomatic covid-19 all over the world has not known and further analysis should be done even though the pathophysiologic mechanism of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions in covid-19 patients has not been clearly identified yet it is also very interesting that the clinical manifestations of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions were different according to gender or races moreover it is necessary to follow the clinical course and the long-term results of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions in the cured covid-19 patients although there is still a lack of our understanding of covid-19 the number of covid-19 patients is rapidly increasing all over the world based on the recent reports and studies sudden olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions may be the early signs of covid-19 though all olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions are not caused only by covid-19 even at present therefore if there are any persons complaining of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions in covid 19 pandemic areas it is suggested that accurate and urgent diagnostic test for covid-19 should be applied by doing so health providers can get an opportunity to prepare personal protective equipment in advance and isolate the suspected asymptomatic patients or with mild symptom to prevent the further spread of

3 the novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 has spread across 210 nations and regions with 12 million confirmed cases and 67594 deaths noted on april 6 2020 the who declared public health emergency at international level the worldwide community gets worried about covid-19 and its impact on public health who is trying to control the impact of pandemic through identification testing treatment of patients clinical trials for drugs and development of new vaccines4 in india first case of covid 19 was reported on january 30 2020 who returned from wuhan china considering the first case as a matter of great worry screening of traveller at airport has been started immediate chinese visas have been cancelled and people who were found affected from covid-19 had been quarantined5 the ministry of health and family welfare mohfw of india had primarily warned to avoid travelling to china and quarantine of those returning from china6 however india is at high risk being the second highest populated country in the world most of the studies show the prediction of covid 19 through modeling for growth of infected population in the absence of a licensed vaccine or effective therapeutics for covid-19 other advises from hand cleanliness to quarantine a basic strategy to control spread of epidemic and alleviation mediation towards the early detection and quarantine of cases can break the chain of transmission the sars-cov-2 pandemic is currently a great challenge for researchers clinicians health-care workers and decision makers we depict the most striking difficulties for statisticians who need to provide support in this pandemic with their proficiency having a knowledge of the dynamics of case load rate and recovery rate of covid-19 can enhance the basic understanding to a large extent based on the current patterns of the severity of the epidemic as covid-19 cases are increasing day-by-day case load rate will be of utmost importance in predicting the declination of the epidemic in this article we want to predict the exact date when the recovery rate of patients would be more than new confirmed cases in india this date is defined as disease declined date data safety patients consent ethical approvals are essential in non-pandemic circumstance but there are administrative barriers to get access to clinical data pandemic circumstances need precise handling of these issues and should be examined on nationwide clinical data are extremely time-dependent and involve progressive statistical methods7 data has been obtained with parameters as cumulative confirmed cases recovered cases and deaths from the online websites httpsdatahubiocorecovid-19resource-covid-19zip total 216919 cumulative confirmed cases 104107 recovered cases and 6075 deaths were found till date 04 june2020 and included in the study the whole analysis has been carried out with data available on cumulative confirmed cases recovered cases and number of deaths recovery rate is defined as the proportion of number of recovered cases to total confirmed cases while the case load rate is defined as the proportion of case load to confirmed cases following formulae have been used for estimation purpose in table 1

 total 2169191 confirmed cases and 104107 recovered cases were involved in the study recovery rate had been estimated as 4799 on the basis of confirmed and recovered cases total case load was found to be 106737 cases and case load rate was estimated as 4921 death rate was obtained as 280 based on 6075 dead patients delta being the difference of case load rate and recovery rate was obtained as 121 on june 04 2020 as evident from table 1 the value of delta has been estimated from january 30 2020 to june 04 2020 it has been predicted that the value of delta would be least on june 12 2020 it means the difference between cases load rate and recovery rate would approach a negligible value this indicates that confirmed cases expected would start to decline thereafter with respect to recovered cases as shown in fig 1
 2019-ncov is a new coronavirus which is unique in relation to sars infections and has never been found in the human population afore8 the cases caused by 2019-ncov has evidently confirmed strong relational correspondence ability and the population is usually vulnerable9 this study deals with the estimation of the recovery rate and case load rate in india the impact might be decreased with the prevention and control actions implemented by the indian government the results of this study suggest that actively adopting a containment strategy will continue to increase the control of the epidemic in india lockdown quarantine and clinical perception and suspected cases will reduce the incidence and imposing restriction on population movement complete lockdown will help to reduce the risk of covid 19 in india10 explicitly various kinds of model have been utilized by the investigators keeping in view the main objective for which the model has been created with conclusion the cumulative confirmed cases and evolving reports of better understanding and better expectation of the imminent estimates from other nations have resulted in emerging mathematical tools for forecast the validity of different preventive and management policies some of these predicting models have suggested useful insights and supported policy decisions11 in india initially the recovery rate has been decreasing till date april 10 2020 with some peaks in between after that it is approximately increasing with its maximum value of 4799 as of june 04 2020 this finding suggests that lockdown strategy has played a great role in retarding the spread of the disease similarly case load rate is inconsistent in starting till april 10 2020 after that it is continuously decreasing and is least as of june 04 2020 having a value of 4921 which shows that lockdown 2 and subsequent lockdowns have greatly contributed in reducing the risk of epidemic in this article proposed models have resulted in findings regarding the recovery rate and case load rate associated with covid-19 disease with application of statistics estimates of delta have been used for prediction purpose investigation has been made on the issue of covid-19 pandemic spread in india in the current challenging scenario trend knowledge has been observed with the help of recovery rate and case load rate obtained for the data available the various strategies implemented as lockdown quarantine of population have played a significant role in reducing the risk of spread of epidemic this study predicts that when the cases load rate gets lesser than recovery rate there after covid-19 patients would start to decline this study is restricted within the time period of analysis till june 04 2020 in india different models were considered to estimate covid-19 extent and claimed to be precise however they critically revealed data gaps and prerequisite to adjust difficult variables such as effect and uncertainty of lockdown risk factors and social distancing might be reflected before generalizing the findings the authors did not receive any funding for this work the authors declare no conflict of interest  worldwide ace

the middle east respiratory syndrome 1 two conditions that cause fatal respiratory diseases in humans after infection coronaviruses coves of the coronaviridae family are enveloped viruses with a single-strand positive-sense rna genome having the largest known rna virus genome 1 2 in humans cov infections mainly involve the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts causing various symptoms ranging from a mild self-limited disease such as common cold to the more severe manifestations such as bronchitis and pneumonia 3 in 1965 the first human coronavirus hcv was isolated from the nasal discharge of common cold patients 4 infected patients with the novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 demonstrated clinical manifestations with extreme pneumonia and increased mortality rates currently there is no definite andor effective treatment for covid-19 5 sun et al in their latest publication expressed the possible interaction of covid-19 and ace2 which may result in the degradation of ace2 and the blockage of the pathway to the receptor by ace2ang 17mas receptor 6 the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been proposed as probable beneficial treatments for covid-19 insinuating the ras system as an important target for the treatment of lung diseases 5 comparing the occurrence of the disease in different geographical areas having genetically diverse ethnicities can provide a scientific foundation for future researches to implement protocols on covid-19 treatment considering the quick advent of the coronavirus disease and the current data shortfall on the virus pathophysiology the event rate for the number of positive cases of coronavirus and its associated death rates for each country was extracted from the who website the inclusion criteria for the countries were as follows a at least 14 days incubation time-lapse from first detected covid-19 case in the country b more than 1000 detected cases of covid-19 and c availability of studies reporting id polymorphism in the country to evaluate the coronavirus prevalence based on its association with the reninangiotensin system studies reporting the prevalence of ace id polymorphism in each country were collected to estimate the pooled id ratio considering the systematic studies and meta-analysis reporting system prisma statement to select the studies reporting ace id polymorphism prevalence isi pubmed scopus and google scholar databases were searched with keywords such as ace gene polymorphism id and the name of each country from the year 1990 to 2020 three researchers simultaneously searched for the published articles if previous meta-analyses were available in any particular country the same study was referred to in the first step 1399 studies were evaluated based on their titles and after excluding 84 duplicated studies 154 studies were also excluded due to their irrelevance in the full-text review of the selected articles 431 were excluded as a result of the study having been conducted either in a false study region or not having healthy controls or not reporting id polymorphism the main inclusion criterion was providing the general prevalence of ace id polymorphism in the healthy population finally 116 articles were used for data extraction the dataset of i and d allele frequency in the healthy control group of each study was extracted data were analyzed based on the random-effects model using the comprehensive meta-analysis software version 2 i2 indices were used to determine the heterogeneity between studies as the i2 index of pooled id allele frequency ratio was 99 random-effects models were used the inverse method was also applied to estimate the variance and weight for each study the bias of publication was assessed by eggers regression intercept to assess the pooled id allele frequency figs 1 and 2 ratio in each country 116 studies reporting the id polymorphism genotypes in healthy controls were included in the study the last update of the 2nd april 2020 statistics of the world health organization was extracted based on each countrys total positive cases total deaths and total recovered patients meta-regression of moderator variables of the total death rate and the total recovered rate vs the point estimate of the id allele frequency ratio were provided as shown in table 1 the dataset of all included studies are available in supplementary table s1 the results of the meta-analysis of the pooled id allele frequency ratio of included studies are shown in table 1 the point estimate of ratio was 0403 ci 95 03980409 in all countries the id allele frequency ratio was below 1 except in south-africa china japan israel and denmark where the value was above 1 the average id allele ratio in europe was 055 while it was 093 in the whole of asia no evidence of bias in the publication has been found in the overall analysis eggers p value  0281 the results of the meta-regression are shown in figs 2 and 3 with the increase of the id allele ratio in the studied countries the recovery rate significantly increased point estimate 048 ci 95 005091 p  0027 meanwhile there was no significant difference in the case of death rate point estimate 174 ci 95 45 to 104 p  0220 our current knowledge of the new covid-19 is rapidly being augmented researchers around the world are looking forward to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease our study revealed a possible relationship between ace id allele frequency and the covid-19 recovery rate also this study showed that the ace id allele ratio is very diverse worldwide east asian countries such as china and japan all had a ratio of more than 1 showing a higher rate of i allele frequency in east asia there appeared to be more i-alleles than d in the population genome of the people however south korea has an allele ratio of 087 which is still much higher than in european countries these findings are consistent with studies of ace id genetic mapping similar to our report saab et al examined the average ace ii genotype frequency in healthy subjects in different populations of different countries 6 they disclosed that ace i allele and genotype frequencies show an association with longitude a regional analysis perpetrated a strong correlation between ii genotype frequency and longitude indicated by a decrease in the ii frequency from europe toward the middle east and an alternate east-bound rise toward asia summarily the average frequency of the ii genotype in the north of europe and denmark was 23 while the uk and spain recorded 20 and 15 whereas northern and southern italy registered 14 and 12 with china and japan averaging 35 and 45 respectively 6 also this finding was confirmed in our study as denmark had an ace id ratio of 101 which was higher than in other european countries the interesting finding of saab et als study about the lowest ii genotypes of europe in italy makes us think about a possible role of genetic factors and the tragedy of the covid-19 outbreak in italy with a high case-fatality rate 7 european countries like italy spain and the uk have been widely affected by covid-19 it is well known that ace i allele frequency in europe is lower than in east asia as seen in our study which indicated the average ace id allele ratio in europe as 055 while it was 093 in the whole of asia this finding confirms the results of wang et als study as they estimated the average ace insertion frequency in east asia to be 063 and 043 in europe 8 the diversity in the mode of disease dissemination in different regions can be attributed to a large number of genetic and environmental influences and this has led researchers to investigate the possible interconnection between environmental influences such as weather with the covid-19 pandemic 9 noteworthy is the fact that whereas the synthetic temperature factor has been positively associated with d allele synthetic humidity factor and d allele are negatively linked in terms of global regional spread and interdependence between these two factors and the d allele assumes an out of africa expansion pattern in space 10 per our results regarding the ace id ratio li et al had shown that the highest frequency of d allele appears in africa europe america and the arab regions whereas the lowest frequency is located in east asia based on their study usa is located in a relative high frequency of d allele 10 which was confirmed by our study and this high d allele frequency may be associated with bad outcomes of covid-19 in this country researchers have suggested that the virus binds to the ace2 receptor on the surface of human cells through its envelope spike glycoprotein and enters the cell 11 on the other hand in the study of monteil et al it was found that human recombinant soluble ace2 could block sars-cov-2 cell attachment 12 a comprehensive review by fan et al underscored the close relationship between ace2 and ace through which ace2 regulates ras exhibiting a greater than 40 identity with the somatic ace catalytic domain 13 still in the perspective of ace cao et al evaluated the allele frequency of 62 variants in the coding regions of ace2 in different populations despite demonstrating the predisposition of the ace2 gene polymorphism in different populations worldwide they however could not pinpoint any specific evidence to confirm the presence of the ace2 binding-resistant coronavirus s-protein mutants in various populations 14 also not all lung tissue cells expressed ace2 and its expression was concentrated in some type ii alveolar cells 15 cao et al found specific polymorphisms associated with higher ace2 expression in the east asian population 14 in our study the highest id allele ratio was seen in china and japan in east asia this similarity reinforces the idea of the populations difference in the ras system that may predispose them to a divergent susceptibility to the disease while the genetic predisposition of the ace genes in covid-19 patients has not yet been examined the relationship between other respiratory diseases and the ace genotype has been investigated in various studies in one study that investigated the relationship between the ace genotype and the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome it was found that the frequency of dd genotype of patients was significantly higher than that of healthy controls 16 this conforms with our finding which demonstrates that with the increase of the id allele ratio i allele increases or d allele decreases the recovery rate increases hence it is not surprising to see a higher recovery rate in east asian countries such as japan point estimate 118 ci 95 106 to 13 china point estimate 117 ci 95 114 to 121 and s korea point estimate 087 ci 95 081094 p  00001 due to the high id allele ratio in the population as expected the worst-hit european countries like spain point estimate 04 ci 95 037042 italy point estimate 049 ci 95 047051 and uk point estimate 066 ci 95 065 to 068 p  00001 all have low id allele ratio from the forest plot analysis also in another study the researchers found that the d allele had a role in the progression of noninfectious pulmonary dysfunction 17 that notwithstanding this study is restricted by the varied known and unknown factors affecting the global recovery and death rate of covid-19 patients including demographic characteristics such as patients sex age underlying diseases and the various approaches used to treat patients in the different regions these data were not yet publicly available worldwide to be considered in our study besides the utilization of official numbers of covid-19 infected people are biased by the number of correct diagnoses that are carried out in each country and this might consequently affect the recovery and death rates despite the limitations cited above our result demonstrating the positive correlation of the id ace gene allele ratio with the recovery rate of covid-19 patients presents a hypothesis worth considering for further studies we suggest case-control studies to assess the role of the definitive ace gene polymorphism on treatment outcomes the importance of our finding is rooted in the possibility that these genetic variations may cause different responses to the covid-19 treatments focusing on the ras system components which are currently being investigated in experimental studies  persistent infections support maintenance of a coronavirus in a population of australian bats myotis macropus j jeong c smith s a peel j r plowright k d kerlin h j mcbroom h mccallum   coronaviruses have been increasingly recognised as a human public health issue following the emergence of high-impact zoonotic diseases from bats  the mammalian order that hosts the largest diversity of coronaviruses 1 examples include the coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which claimed 916 lives out of 8422 cases from november 2002 to august 2003 2 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers which has claimed 608 lives out of 1449 cases as of 31 august 2016 3 sars-like coronaviruses sl-cov are maintained in bats 4 and mers coronavirus mers-cov is assumed to have originated in bats 5 the findings that genetically diverse sl-cov strains share high similarity with sars coronavirus sars-cov and that bats harbour diverse coronaviruses which can be classified to the same coronavirus species as mers-cov suggest that recurrent coronavirus epidemics and pandemics in humans are likely 6 genetic analyses of coronaviruses in bats suggested that the diversity of coronaviruses in bats may provide further opportunities for spillover into other species 7 mitigation of spillover of the viruses is based on understanding of the maintenance mechanism of multihost viruses in reservoir hosts bats may have idiosyncratic immune responses allowing them to be infected with no signs of disease with viruses that are highly pathogenic in other species 8 this feature of bats may contribute to their ability to host zoonoses including sars mers ebola marburg nipah and hendra viruses a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this some authors suggest that bats ability to fly induces fever helping to control viruses 9 others suggest that immune system adaptation allows tolerance of intracellular pathogens 10 and that co-evolution during a long history between specific viruses and bat hosts results in no pathogenicity to bats whereas recent host shifts from bats to other mammals result in high fatality rates 11 12 two conditions must be met for bats to be reservoir hosts of emerging infectious diseases first the ability to maintain pathogens in their populations and second the ability to transmit those pathogens to another species this paper concentrates on the first of these conditions features that may contribute to viral maintenance in bat populations include 1 a metapopulation structure that avoids viral extinction across the total population via sub-populations which allow reinfection through movement 13 14 2 reduced metabolism during hibernation that facilitates viral survival 15 and 3 persistent infections with chronic shedding or intermittent recrudescence 16 17 this study focuses on the feature of persistent infection persistent infections of sars-cov in vitro studies support the plausibility of persistent infections of coronaviruses in bats 18 19 in persistent infections a virus is not cleared from the host but remains associated with specific cells for a long period regardless of the mechanisms operating within hosts persistent infection contributes to viral maintenance within populations and has been considered as a mechanism of viral maintenance in reservoir hosts of other emerging infectious diseases 20 this study is based on data obtained in a previously reported capturemarkrecapture cmr study 21 of a maternal roost of myotis macropus this microbat microchiroptera also known as large-footed myotis is widely distributed in australia 22 m macropus inhabits areas close to waterways in small groups 21 foraging on aquatic invertebrate and small fish 22 the bats in the study region form maternity roosts biannually in october and january and deliver single young 21 gestation and lactation periods are 12 and 8 weeks respectively 21 smith undertook a cmr study of m macropus in the lifting holes of a bridge in southeast queensland australia supplementary table s1 21 full details of the methodology are described in the original study 21 briefly the cmr data of 52 australian bats m macropus were collected during nine capturing occasions over 12 weeks from 13 january to 31 march 2009 which overlapped with the january breeding season and subsequent lactation period for this species 21 coronavirus rna was detected in faecal pellets or anal swabs using rtpcr reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting a conserved region of a coronavirus gene 21 of the 52 unique individuals 42 were recaptured at least once and of these 7 16 and 19 bats respectively showed multiple detections a single detection and no detection of coronavirus rna table 1 the data from bats with multiple detections of coronavirus rna were suggestive of persistent infections 21 the cmr dataset are unusual and particularly valuable in that the data contain individual tracking records with infection states longitudinal sampling of individual bats is necessary to explore persistent infection and to test whether persistent infection is a possible viral maintenance mechanism in a bat population for many bats large population size and migratory behaviour have impeded obtaining individual data most field studies have therefore been cross-sectional 14 23 24 rather than following individuals through time limiting development of understanding the maintenance mechanism of bat-borne viruses
 here we apply quantitative analyses in a bayesian framework to the cmr data from smith 21 to derive parameter estimates for epidemic models to investigate the effects of persistent infection on viral maintenance in a bat population we analysed the cmr data using multistate models to estimate survival rates  recapture rates p and transition rates  fig 1 the multistate models included two states infectious and non-infectious with transitions in both directions 25 each time step was a week in addition to investigate persistent infection in the bat population we explored multistate models in which bats were divided into two groups based on the frequency of coronavirus rna detection recaptured bats with a single detection were referred to as transiently infectious bats and recaptured bats with multiple detections were referred to as persistently infectious bats bats that were only captured once were excluded from analysis table 1 five bats were once captured with a single detection of coronavirus rna and those five bats were excluded from two groups
 to analyse the cmr data we chose a bayesian method over a frequentist approach because the bayesian method is more appropriate in dealing with a small amount of data relying less on large sample asymptotic approximations 26 the bayesian analyses were conducted in r 27 and in openbugs using the r package r2openbugs 28 openbugs was used to run three independent chains of an mcmc markov chain monte carlo sampler for 10 000 iterations each after discarding the initial 1000 samples as a burn in the mean of each of the parameters was calculated as were the 25th and 975th percentiles of the parameter distributions 95 bayesian credible intervals cri the relevant r code is provided as supplementary material r code s1 and s2 we used cmr multistate model selection to determine whether grouping of persistently and transiently infectious bats and the inclusion of infectious and non-infectious states were supported by the cmr data the grouping and the multiple states were applied to survival recapture and transition rates of the cmr data comparisons between the candidate multistate models were assessed with deviance information criterion dic 29 and the most parsimonious model was selected for subsequent simulated epidemic models survival rates  were used to calculate mortality rates  transition rates  from the infectious to non-infectious state ui were used to calculate infectious period which is a reciprocal of recovery rate  table 2 failure to detect coronavirus rna in faeces or anal swabs may not necessarily imply recovery from the infection and could conceivably represent intermittent viral excretion or false-negative laboratory results however recovery from sars coronavirus infection in humans has been shown to occur when virus is no longer detected in faecal samples 30 in the absence of specific information about recovery from coronavirus infection in these bats we assumed that failure to detect coronavirus in faecal samples or anal swabs similarly corresponded to recovery
 the transmission rate  could not be directly calculated from the cmr data analyses and was instead calculated from basic reproduction number r0 equations from drexler et als study 14 and from observation of the cmr data 21 smith 21 hypothesised that the initial epidemic peak was caused by the formation of a maternity roost of m macropus from weeks 1 to 6 and that a second epidemic peak after parturition was caused by newborn pups who lost their passive immunity from weeks 6 to 12 thus with an assumption that a new epidemic began from week 7 we used an equation of r0  1  d 31 where  represents the growth rate in an epidemic and d represents the average duration of the infectious period we calculated  as 03328 per week by using the cmr data from weeks 7 to 12 supplementary figure s1 we estimated mean d as 17737 weeks from the infectious period of recaptured bats 1 table 2 thus we estimated r0 to be 15903 we estimated  using r0  nd where n is the total population size 31 by assuming that n was 86 the mean estimated size of the study population 21 we could calculate  00104 a rate of waning immunity  was unable to be estimated from this cmr data and has not been estimated in other studies in the absence of data to suggest otherwise we assumed the rate of waning immunity was comparable to that in human sars-cov infections 30 uncertainty in parameter values was included by sampling mortality and recovery rates from pert distributions using the r package mc2d 32 we built a deterministic density-dependent susceptibleinfectiousrecoveredsusceptible sirs model using ode ordinary differential equations we assumed that density dependence was appropriate for a coronavirus because sars-cov is transmitted in bats via a faecaloral route which is more suggestive of density-dependent transmission than frequency-dependent transmission 33 34 and that sars infection in humans has been modelled with density-dependent transmission 35 36 further the number of bats in the roost was relatively small and this would allow homogenously mixed contacts among bats 21 we used a sirs model for coronavirus infection in bats following previous authors who have used sirs models for coronavirus infection in miniopterus spp 21 additionally high sars-cov seroprevalence in bats supports the existence of a recovered class 4 in the cmr data positive detections of coronavirus rna occasionally encompassed negative detections and negative detections occasionally encompassed positive detections implying that infectiousness and non-infectiousness were not permanent 21 to test effects of grouping of bats into persistently infectious and transiently infectious bats on the probability of viral persistence in the bat population we designed two alternative models a one-group model and a two-group model fig 2 the one-group model did not differentiate between persistently infectious and transiently infectious states instead assumed that all recaptured bats n  23 with multiple or single detection of coronavirus rna in the cmr data had the same recovery and mortality rates regardless of the number of coronavirus rna detections on the other hand the two-group model split bats into persistently infectious and transiently infectious groups we assumed that recaptured bats with multiple detection of coronavirus rna were persistently infectious n  7 and recaptured bats with single detection of coronavirus rna in the cmr data were transiently infectious n  16 given the multistate model selection preferred the inclusion of the multistate effect table 3 we estimated different mortality rates for infectious bats i class and non-infectious bats s and r classes

 in the one-group model the mean prevalence p  02786 of coronavirus in the cmr data was used to set the initial number of infectious bats in the model with the population size n  86 and the remaining bats were considered susceptible s  1pn i  pn r  0 in the two-group model the initial number of infectious bats was set based on the proportion of persistently infectious bats in infectious bats out of recaptured bats in the cmr data f  723 s  1pn ip  fpn it  1fpn and r  0 six scenarios were set up based on different infectious periods scenario 1 was developed to describe the dynamics of coronavirus infection in m macropus without grouping bats based on infectious period the one-group model scenarios 26 were two-group models scenario 2 was developed to describe the dynamics when bats were grouped into persistently infectious and transiently infectious bats and scenarios 36 were modifications of scenario 2 with extended periods of persistent infection while we used the infectious periods calculated from the cmr data analyses in scenarios 1 and 2 we assumed extended infectious period of persistently infectious bats to 5 7 9 and 11 weeks in scenario 36 respectively following a previous study in which m macropus could be identified with a putative novel alphacoronavirus infection for up to 11 weeks 21 we simulated the model with 10 000 iterations sampling from the range of parameter values calculated from the cmr data and estimated the probability of viral persistence in the population of m macropus the r package desolve 37 was used to build the epidemic model time steps were weekly following the time interval of the cmr data 21 see supplementary material r code s3 we assumed that the virus persisted in the population when at least one infectious bat remained at week 12 the multistate models enabled estimation of survival and recapture rates of m macropus and transition rates between infectious and non-infectious states table 2 the survival rates were relatively constant during the period whereas the recapture rates generally decreased in the first half and increased in the second half of capturing occasions fig 1a as a result the transition rates should be considered with caution when recapture rate was low for example only one bat was captured at the fifth recapturing occasion fig 1b paucity of the cmr data resulted in wide error bars the most parsimonious model supported grouping of bats into two groups based on the detection frequency of coronavirus rna single and multiple detections for all three rates of survival recapture and transition there was little support for multistate effects on the survival rate dic  02 comparing models 1 and 2 table 3 this was in accordance with previous findings that coronavirus infection in bats showed no signs of illness 7 8 the results of model selection processes also indicated that the multistate effect should be excluded for recapture rate and should be intrinsically considered for transition rate the sirs epidemic models were simulated to generate the probabilities of coronavirus persistence in a bat population in the six scenarios the simulated probability of viral persistence in scenario 2 two-group model 05210 was somewhat higher than the probability in scenario 1 one-group model 04094 table 4 this result showed that viruses were more likely to be maintained in the bat population when bats could either be persistently infectious or transiently infectious than when bats were not split into these groups as the period of persistent infection was lengthened to 5 weeks in scenario 3 the probability of persistence within the population reached to almost 1 in scenario 46 in which the periods of persistent infection were lengthened to 7 9 and 11 weeks respectively the virus persisted in the population in every simulation although smith 21 found that m macropus can be identified with a putative novel alphacoronavirus infection over periods of up to 11 weeks extension of the period of persistent infection from about 3 weeks scenario 2 to 5 weeks scenario 3 markedly increased the probability of viral maintenance to almost one
 this study analysed cmr data of a species of australian bats m macropus with a putative novel alphacoronavirus infection in order to decide whether it is appropriate to divide bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats and to determine whether viral maintenance is improved by the differentiation of bats into these groups grouping of bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats was supported by the cmr multistate model selection processes table 3 by exploring various scenarios in epidemic models we found that population-level viral persistence was marginally more probable when infectious periods were heterogeneous bats were either transiently or persistently infectious table 4 in addition to a previous study that suggested persistent infection of coronavirus in bats in north america through the small number of bats sampled 23 our study provides much validity by using larger number of bats sampled 21 although the sample size is still not large enough to provide robust estimates further understanding of the potential and likelihood of within-host persistent infections is important to understand spillover of bat-borne viruses persistent infections contribute not only in maintaining viruses in a population but also in triggering pulses of virus shedding temporally synchronised stressors such as food shortage and reproduction may weaken the immune system of bats facilitating persistent infections in infectious bats 38 thus those temporally synchronised stressors can cause viral shedding from persistently infectious bats during a limited period leading to pulses of viral shedding because spillover of bat-borne viruses has been associated with pulses of viral shedding from bats 38 the finding of persistent infection in bats contributes in understanding spillover mechanisms of bat-borne viruses maternity roosts were assumed to play an important role in maintaining coronavirus at the population level 24 in coronavirus transmission within a population of myotis an epidemic peak was observed at the formation of the maternity colony and another peak was observed as newborn pups lost their passive immunity 14 transmission of viruses during the breeding season is more readily facilitated compared with other times due to frequent contact among individuals within a maternity roost 14 21 39 fluctuating recapture rates and coronavirus prevalence are presumed to be related to the changing ethology of bats during the breeding season therefore cmr data covering both breeding seasons and non-breeding seasons are required to investigate how coronaviruses can be maintained in a bat population even if maternal roosts do not facilitate viral transmission these findings need to be treated with some caution because the low sample size limits our confidence in the results of modelling for example the recapture rates were markedly different from recapturing occasion to occasion fig 1a as only one bat was sampled at the fifth recapturing occasion 21 additionally the cmr data included only coronavirus rna detections without detections of coronavirus antibodies a sars coronavirus crude antigen elisa was not successful in detecting antibodies against the putative novel alphacoronavirus in these bats 21 thus the lack of seroprevalence in the cmr data limited the accuracy of the estimated duration of recovery nevertheless the cmr data deserve intensive analyses because longitudinal sampling of individual bats for infectious diseases is difficult to achieve and allows estimation of epidemiological parameters the cmr study in smiths study 21 had relatively high recapture rates thanks to finding a lifting hole of a bridge where bats infected with coronavirus roosted with a high affinity to their colony fluctuating recapture rates across capturing occasions in the cmr data which might be associated with trap-shy and adaptive methods of capturing highlighted the difficulty of recapturing specific bats during the entire sampling period persistent infections have been hypothesised as a mechanism for viral persistence not only in coronaviruses 23 but also in other bat-borne viruses for example filoviruses and henipaviruses despite lack of direct evidence 20 it was also hypothesised that a small portion of super-long-shedder bats with a long infectious period could maintain hendra virus in a bat population 13 although further comprehensive datasets are needed to understand the effects of persistent infection this study shows the value of longitudinal individual data from bats with viral infections to elucidate transmission dynamics of bat-borne viruses underscoring the need of individual bat tracking data with infection states to improve our understanding of infection dynamics of bat-borne viruses  endocrine changes in sars-cov-2 patients and lessons from sars-cov shubham agarwal sanjeev agarwal kumar   on 31 december 2019 the who office in china was informed of a few cases of pneumonia of unknown cause originating from the city of wuhan hubei in china1 over the next 3 months the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 illness commonly called covid-19 has affected more than four million people globally with over 14 million cases in the usa itself making it the new epicentre of the illness followed by much of western europe the mortality rates from different parts of the world show vast differences but studies have consistently shown that the presence of comorbidities specially type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly increases mortality in patients with sars-cov-2 with an or of 28525 a study from china also showed that patients in the intensive care unit with sars-cov-2 infection were more likely to have underlying diabetes 222 vs 59 than others6 certain forms of hypophysitis thyroiditis and adrenalitis have viral aetiologies changes in endocrine functions observed during the previous coronavirus outbreak with sars-cov led to considerable morbidity and were important predictors of mortality therefore it is imperative to know the endocrinopathic impact of sars-cov-2 illness the purpose of this review is to highlight the available data on endocrine changes in such patients and to recapitulate the existing knowledge from previous coronavirus outbreaks for better risk stratification and management of patients with sars-cov-2 infection all articles reporting endocrine changes in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov patients were considered electronic database of pubmed was searched using medical subject headings mesh terms related to sars-cov-2 sars-cov and different hormones since the sars-cov outbreak occurred in 2002 search results were limited to january 2002 onwards to consider articles pertaining to the outbreaks of both the viruses a considerable number of articles were in the chinese language and were included after being translated into english this was supplemented by handsearching reference lists for additional studies and case reports similarly google scholar database was handsearched studies listing type 2 diabetes mellitus as a risk factor of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were excluded since they did not mention any biochemical changes articles about corticosteroid induced hyperglycaemia audio interviews and articles detailing the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system raas inhibitors were excluded an initial search showed 1585 articles finally 17 of them were included figure 1 a detailed histopathological study on the effects of sars infection on the thyroid gland was done during the sars-cov outbreak7 there was extensive injury of the parafollicular cells and follicular epithelium with the destruction and exfoliation of epithelial cells into the follicle leading to its disruption these changes were responsible for lower levels of thyroid hormones noted in clinical studies parafollicular cells are responsible for calcitonin production and they could not be identified on he sections in the tissue sample from patients with sars damage to interfollicular tissue including parafollicular cells may adversely affect calcitonin production an interesting finding was the absence of inflammatory infiltrate and features of cellular necrosis supporting the hypothesis of extensive apoptosis responsible for thyroid injury the pathology data of the thyroid gland in patients with sars-cov-2 infection have been published by yao et al they conducted minimally invasive autopsies from different organs in patients who had died of sars-cov-2 and investigated the pathological changes8 they reported no abnormalities in the thyroid follicular morphology but did note lymphocytic infiltration in the interstitium none of the tissue immunohistochemistry and pcr analyses detected sars-cov-2 in the thyroid gland these findings are at variance with those reported in sars-cov though the patient characteristics in the two studies were nearly the same however irrespective of pathological findings most of the studies found a similar pattern of biochemical changes limited data suggest that the thyroid gland and the hypothalamopituitarythyroid hpt axis are directly affected in sars-cov-2 illness a study of 274 patients with sars-cov-2 showed that thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and free triiodothyronine t3 concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients 07 miuml and 28 pmoll than in recovered patients 14 miuml and 43 pmoll the difference in the thyroxine t4 levels was not statistically significant9
 a study by wang et al reported that serum levels of t3 and t4 in patients with sars-cov were significantly lower than those in the control group and low t3 levels correlated with disease severity serum t3 and t4 levels were decreased respectively in 94 and 46 of 48 patients with sars-cov during the acute phase and 90 and 38 during the convalescent phase of the disease10 the authors also noted lower levels of tsh in these patients dysfunction of the hpt axis caused a diminished level of serum tsh in patients with sars-cov despite low serum t3 and t4 no significant difference in serum parathyroid hormone level was observed between patients with sars-cov and the control group during the acute or convalescent phases of the illness changes in thyroid hormone levels may persist after clinical recovery leow et al studied sars-cov survivors for hormonal derangements 3 months after recovery and noted that 67 of the patients had developed biochemical hypothyroidism11 the majority of these patients 75 had a central aetiology and only 25 developed primary hypothyroidism with positive antibodies and continued to receive thyroid hormone replacement at the end of the study on follow-up changes in the thyroid profile of the patients with central hypothyroidism had normalised central hypocortisolism was also present in 66 of patients who had central hypothyroidism the authors suggested a dysfunctional hpt axis as evidenced by the results of thyroid hormones and the coexistence of central hypocortisolism these studies suggest for the monitoring of thyroid function tests during acute illness as well as during convalescence of sars-cov-2 with the possibility of replacement therapy as indicated there were reports of recovery of thyroid function in 3 6 months in sars-cov patients implying reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic11
 many viruses such as enteroviruses coxsackie b virus12 retroviruses rubella mumps cytomegalovirus epstein-barr and varicella zoster virus have been implicated in the development of diabetes mellitus in humans13
 coronavirus has also been reported to cause diabetes in animal and human studies in a case report of a foal it was suggested that the pancreas could have had direct viral damage due to coronavirus leading to diarrhoea and transient diabetes mellitus simultaneously14
 it has been demonstrated that coronaviruses enter human lungs pancreas and other tissues by interacting with the ace2 receptor the expression of ace2 is much stronger in pancreatic endocrine tissue compared with the exocrine tissue15 the extent of tissue damage by sars-cov is a direct function of the level of expression of tissue ace2 thus sars-cov viruses may damage pancreatic islets and cause acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus but not acute pancreatitis the pancreatic biopsy findings in sars-cov-2 patients have been identical to the previous studies in sars-cov patients yao et al reported no obvious abnormalities in the epithelial cells in the exocrine pancreas however degeneration of a few islet cells was noted8
 it was observed that patients with mild sars-cov who did not receive glucocorticoid medications during the disease course had a higher level of fasting plasma glucose fpg on the first day of hospitalisation than those who had non-sars pneumonia new-onset diabetes developed in 51 of sars-cov patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment during illness15 hyperglycaemia was an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in sars-cov patients with and without a history of diabetes mellitus4 yang et al demonstrated that before steroid treatment the mean fpg level was significantly higher in sars-cov patients deceased vs survivors vs non-sars pneumonia group 9752 vs 6530 vs 5110 mmoll p001 hyperglycaemia fpg70 mmoll before steroid treatment was significantly associated with death or 33 after adjustment for age and gender there was an incremental rise in mortality with increasing fpg another interesting association noted was between hypoxaemia and higher fpg levels4 among patients with no known history of diabetes and before the commencement of steroid therapy those who had hypoxaemia arterial oxygen saturation 93 had higher fpg levels than those who did not have hypoxia in both the survivor 8749 vs 6321 mmoll and deceased 9848 vs 7215 mmoll groups it was estimated that for every 10 mmoll increase in fpg the hr increased by 108-fold for death and 107-fold for hypoxia morbidity in both survivors and deceased patients irrespective of steroid dosage elevated fpg values started falling in the third week indicating gradual recovery of islet cell function about half a billion people are currently living with diabetes worldwide patients with diabetes had a poorer outcome in previous epidemics of sars-cov and h1n1 epidemics16 17 the clinical course of sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes and without other comorbidities was recently reported by guo et al from wuhan china18 patients with diabetes may present with milder symptoms initially but they were at higher risk of rapid progression to severe pneumonia uncontrolled cytokine storm and hypercoagulable state contributing to a poorer prognosis interleukin-6 il-6 level was found to be higher in sars-cov-2 cases with diabetes than those without diabetes wang et al hypothesised that sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes might trigger stress condition and increase secretion of hyperglycaemic hormones such as glucocorticoid and catecholamines resulting in elevated blood glucose abnormal glucose variability and diabetic complications in turn leading to higher mortality and morbidity rates in these patients19
 a study of 99 sars-cov-2 patients demonstrated that 52 of patients had elevated blood glucose with a mean glucose value of 74 mmoll20 wu et al
21 showed that sars-cov-2 patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards had higher glucose levels 74 vs 54 mmoll compared with patients who did not develop ards hr 113 similarly in sars-cov-2 patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms increased glucose level was an independent risk factor for severecritical illness on multivariate analysis or 24222 sars-cov-2 patients with diabetes are at high risk of progressing rapidly with ards and septic shock ma et al recommended fpg of 4461 mmoll 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose 2 h pg 6178 mmoll in mild cases and fpg 78100 mmoll 2 h pg 78139 mmoll for critically ill patients of sars-cov-223
 to sum up sars-cov infections damage islet cells causing acute temporary diabetes high fpg and associated metabolic changes lead to increased morbidity and mortality in these patients in addition pre-existing diabetes may be considered a risk factor for poorer outcomes of sars-cov-2 pneumonia intensive blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy to obtain optimal metabolic control may improve the outcome of these patients tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against il-6 may have a role in patients with diabetes to control overexpressed il-6 it is being used off-label currently and a randomised controlled trial is testing its utility24 the european society of endocrinology statement advises patients with diabetes to avoid physician office visits and seek telephonicelectronic consultations for optimal control of blood sugar they need to get an early referral to emergency services in case of possible symptoms of sars-cov-225
 the histological changes in adrenal glands of the patients dying from sars-cov were described by ding et al from postmortem biopsy samples26 they noted that the adrenal medulla had been infiltrated by mainly the monocytes and lymphocytes another interesting finding was the focal necrosis of the gland in addition vasculitis of the small veins of the adrenal medulla was present no similar studies have been conducted in sars-cov-2 patients until date however there are reasons to believe that similar adrenal gland changes could occur given the similarity of the viral structure and mechanism of entry into human host cells sars-cov genome sequences have been detected in the cytoplasm of numerous neurons in the hypothalamus and cortex27 it might induce either hypophysitis or directly affect the hypothalamus leading to hypothalamicpituitary dysfunction leow et al
11 studied hypocortisolism in patients who had recovered from sars-cov patients with an intact hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis at the time of acquiring sars-cov were included in the study these patients also had symptoms like lethargy malaise lassitude fatigue weakness orthostatic dizziness anorexia apathy anxiety and depression after recovery three months after recovery 393 of patients had hypocortisolism of which 833 had central hypocortisolism as depicted by low adrenocorticotropic hormone acth levels it was interesting to note that the majority of these patients had not received any systemic glucocorticoids as part of the treatment for sars ruling out the possibility of hpa axis suppression by exogenous corticosteroid use the hypocortisolism was however transient and resolved in 625 of patients within a year with an average duration of 5931 months these patients also reported resolution of symptoms including orthostatic hypotension in comparison to the start of the study six patients 25 continued with residual hypocortisolism at 1-year follow-up and one of them still required hydrocortisone replacement a quarter of the patients also revealed transient biochemical thyroid changes with some patients developing both a central hypothyroid and hypoadrenal state with the hpa axis affected more frequently than the hpt axis the authors also found low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate dheas in 131 patients after adjusting for age sex and menopausal status dheas replacement could further ameliorate symptoms in those with dheas deficiency findings from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 patients suggest for actively monitoring biochemical changes like serum cortisol and acth shall these biochemical changes go unnoticed it may complicate post-sars recovery symptomatic patients with orthostatic hypotension may require physiological doses of hydrocortisone replacement until hpa axis recovery in addition patients with adrenal insufficiency and cushings syndrome are at increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection and should adhere to enhanced preventive steps changes in the cells of anterior pituitary were noted in biopsy samples of sars-cov patients28 on immunohistochemical staining the number of somatotrophs thyrotrophs and corticotrophs was reduced while the number of lactotrophs and gonadotrophs was significantly increased these findings correlated with biochemical abnormalities of increased prolactin luteinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in sars-cov reported earlier in chinese literature seasonal and the h1n1 influenza a virus h1n1 pandemic have been associated with increased severity and greater risk of morbidity and mortality in obese persons compared with normal weight persons being overweight and obesity both negatively impact cellular immune response to h1n1 influenza29 obesity is associated with several chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus obstructive sleep apnoea and surfactant dysfunction in the lungs which may increase the risk of complications of sars-cov-2 the intensive care management of patients with severe obesity is always very challenging and difficult30 it is likely that obesity is an independent risk factor for severe sars-cov-2 illness and should be further investigated early studies have linked the increased mortality rates in sars-cov-2 patients with the presence of diabetes mellitus increased glucose levels have been associated with the development of ards and worsening of sars-cov-2 illness requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation hyperglycaemia can be a useful predictor to assess patients and triage them effectively to provide early management strategies strict glucose management is required in such patients to reduce mortality central hypothyroidism and central hypocortisolism seem to occur commonly in patients infected with coronavirus these changes are usually transient and occur during the illness or after recovery this crucial information calls for reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic and identifying these changes early with prompt management can prevent further complications prospective randomised clinical trials cohort studies and pathology studies of sars-cov-2 patients are ongoing and may further elucidate the mechanisms of these endocrinopathies translating into better treatment of patients affected by this virus

emergency use authorization eua on february 4 2020 8  the cdc assay initially targeted three regions of the viral nucleocapsid gene n1 n2 n3 and the human rnase p rp gene as an internal control later changes to the original cdc eua assay included removal of the n3 target and only required single detection of either the n1 or n2 target 9  the assay described in this study has almost all of the components described under the eua for the cdc assay however we use a non-regulated pcr instrument ie abi 7500 which the fda determined is not equivalent to a regulated pcr instrument ie abi 7500 fast dx any modification to the cdc assay including the use of a non-regulated pcr instrument required a new fda eua application in our validation we used the fda eua guidance to determine the target sensitivity and specificity by in silico and wet bench analyses several challenges arose for validating this molecular virology assay including a lack of reference materials a changing regulatory landscape and an unstable supply chain in our assay development we used endemic coronaviruses as surrogates for the extraction efficiency of sars-cov-2 in addition we examined two types of positive

assay run intra-assay precision and were also examined as single sample analysis across six different assay runs inter-assay precision three technologists performed nucleic acid extraction and two technologists performed nucleic acid amplification procedures in four different paired combinations throughout the six assay runs the reference method was a public health laboratory performing the cdc eua assay excel 2016 microsoft corporation redmond wa was used for calculations a descriptive statistic of percentage was used probability values p-values were not used for hypothesis testing optimization of the extraction protocol was performed using a pooled respiratory panel control material exact diagnostics that included endemic coronavirus oc43 whole inactivated virus and endemic coronavirus nl63 in vitro transcribed ivt rna in known concentrations nucleic acid recoveries of endemic coronavirus oc43 and nl63 in np matrix vtm and undiluted were compared with differing input magnetic silica and elution volumes ct values were lowest when control material was directly added to lysis buffer  was similar or worse than detection of oc43 when in np or vtm matrix table s2  samples 4-9 these data suggest a loss of ivt rna compared to whole virus when present in matrix prior to a lysis step an in silico analysis of sensitivity inclusivity and specificity cross-reactivity for the primers and probes used for sars-cov-2 assay validation was performed blastn search across betacoronaviruses 7864 sequences on 03172020 identified all sars-cov-2 genomes 100 representative homologies for 32 isolates in table s3  when combining primer and probe sequences there was no significant homology to high priority pathogens or organisms as defined by the fda eua table s4  analytical cross reactivity of primers and probes was assessed in clinical specimens positive for or spiked with common respiratory pathogens or microbiota n25 and negative patient specimens n5  table s5  all reactions were valid and none of the specimens were amplified by the n1 target 0 of 30 recombinant virus with sars-cov-2 rna was used to determine the limit of detection of the assay by a two-fold dilution series a preliminary dilution in triplicate was performed when all triplicate samples were detected then an extended replicate series of 20 samples was examined we found 100 positive rate at 264 copies per ml table 1  this was substantially lower than we were able to achieve using genomic rna spiked into np samples table 2  which only consistently recovered at 24x10 6 copies per ml mean ct3707 when tested in triplicate however when np was combined with lysis buffer before spiking the rna recovery of rna was improved to 750 copies per ml  table 2  the three-fold difference in limit of detection between virus in a recombinant protein coat compared to genomic rna suggests loss in recovery of genomic rna or rna quantitation differences residual sars-cov-2 positive patient specimens were tested undiluted or diluted in spiked into pooled residual np collection matrix in vtm total of 30 negative specimens all specimens for accuracy were tested in a blinded manner all 75 specimens were concordant table 3 and table s6  all runs were performed using aliquots of the same control material for inter-assay reproducibility the positive and negative controls were run across six assay runs and yielded ct values with cvs of 165 and 102 for n1 and rp targets respectively for the intra-assay reproducibility the positive and negative control samples were run in triplicate within a single run intra-assay reproducibility yielded cvs of 111 and 110 for n1 and rp respectively the imprecision for the inter-technologist precision across four paired technologist combinations one technologist for extraction and one technologist for rt-pcr analysis was 149 and 062 for n1 and rp respectively concordance was 100 and the cv was 2 and standard deviation was 05 ct table s7  in this study we developed and validated a real-time pcr molecular assay to measure rna from sars-cov-2 virus the limit of detection of sars-cov-2 was 264 copies per ml for viral protein encapsulated rna and 750 copies per ml for genomic rna in silico and analytical specificity studies showed no cross-reactivity with common respiratory pathogens a major hurdle to validation was the lack of access to sars-cov-2 live or inactivated virus purified genomic rna was available but demonstrated variable efficiency in extraction recovery endemic coronaviruses were used as surrogates to optimize the extraction process in addition combining lysis buffer with np specimens before spiking non-enveloped rna improved recovery probably by decreasing rna degradation improved rna stability by spiking into matrix combined with buffer has been previously reported 12  this pre-extraction offboard lysis protocol also has an advantage of improving the safety for laboratory testing personnel because it can be performed in a biosafety cabinet the challenge of limited control material or patient specimens may arise again in future infectious disease outbreaks the quickest specimens to be available in the covid-19 outbreak were in vitro transcribed rna and genomic rna these rnas were helpful to optimize postextraction assay characteristics but they showed poor extraction characteristics in future outbreaks production and widespread distribution of viral rna within recombinant protein coat would improve the speed and reliability of molecular assay validation c o n f i d e n t i a l 13 in summary we validated a modified version of the cdc assay under the fdas emergency use authorization with optimizations in offboard lysis and the use of sars-cov-2 rna in a recombinant viral protein coat this assay may be used in high complexity labs for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 in a high-throughput setting   association between initial chest ct or clinical features and clinical course in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia zhe liu chao jin carol wu c ting liang huifang zhao yan wang zekun wang fen li jie zhou shubo cai lingxia zeng jian yang   an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has led to a serious pandemic 1 the disease in some patients progresses into life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome ards as of february 20 2020 a total of 75567 cases with laboratory confirmed covid-19 have been detected in china of whom 2239 have died and 18644 have been cured despite a fatality rate of 296 which is lower than those of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers rapid disease progression and complicated manifestations continue to present great challenges to effective management thus the identification of risk factors related to disease prognosis is valuable to guide treatment implementation and improve utilization of limited resources a prior study of critically ill patients with covid-19 showed that increased age comorbidities and ards were associated with increased risk of death 2 it has been reported that the majority 809 of 2019-ncov infected patients have mild disease with diverse clinical courses due to the heterogeneity of the affected population 3 however risk factors that affected the clinical course of patients with covid-19 pneumonia have yet to be further studied computed tomography ct has been proven as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of covid-19 45 recent publications have characterized typical ct findings of covid-19 pneumonia during the acute progressive and recovery stages 678 ct findings such as ground glass opacities ggo and consolidation were found to correlate with the duration of infection 7 in this regard an understanding of the characteristics of initial chest ct may help to identify prognostic indicators for covid-19 9 the potential associations of age and laboratory test results ie white blood cells lymphocytes and c-reactive protein with disease progression have been demonstrated in severe patients 10 given the above the purpose of this study was to identify the initial chest ct findings and clinical characteristics that were linked to the clinical course of covid-19 pneumonia from january 16 to february 13 2020 a total of 72 patients 39 men 462  159 years with covid-19 confirmed by nucleic acid test were identified from three hospitals in xian shaanxi province china baseline chest ct and laboratory examination results were collected all the patients were treated based on a national standard diagnosis and treatment criteria for covid-19 which includes initiation of antivirals interferon chinese herbal medications supplemental oxygen as needed and hospitalization 11 the disease type ie uncomplicated illness mild pneumonia and severe pneumonia was evaluated by the world health organization criteria in which critical ards sepsis or septic shock were considered severe 12 as covid-19 pneumonia represents a new and rapidly developing outbreak standards were developed to assess patient recovery and readiness for discharge after treatment 11 and were set as follows 1 normal body temperature for more than 3 days 2 significant improvement of respiratory symptoms such as respiratory rate hypoxemia or spo2 values returned to normal range 3 inflammation of the lungs showed obvious findings of absorption on ct imaging and 4 two consecutive negative respiratory viral nucleic acid tests taken at least one day apart the chest ct scans were acquired by using 16- to 64-multidetector ct scanners philips brilliant 16 philips healthcare best netherlands ge vct lightspeed 64 ge healthcare milwaukee wi usa ge optima 680 ge healthcare waukesha wi usa the ct parameters were as follows 120 kvp current intelligent control auto ma of 30300 ma and slice thickness reconstructions of 0615 mm all ct scans were performed without intravenous contrast material the demographic data exposure history clinical symptoms laboratory findings and the time from disease onset to hospital visit were obtained from the medical records the date of disease onset was defined as patients reported date of symptom onset the clinical course ie the time from symptom onset to discharge with recovery or the end of follow-up were collected the ct images were each independently reviewed by two experienced radiologists with 5 years of experience and if there was a disagreement the diagnosis would be made in consensus by another expert with more than 10 years of experience in respiratory imaging as previously reported 8 ct findings including the presence and distribution of ggo consolidation linear opacity pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were evaluated we also evaluated the degree of lobar involvement and total lung severity score each of the five lung lobes was assessed in detail for degree or area of involvement and assigned a score of 0 for 0 lobe involvement 1 for 125 lobe involvement 2 for 2650 lobe involvement 3 for 5175 lobe involvement or 4 for 76100 lobe involvement according to visual evaluation 8 a total severity score was calculated by summing the five lobe scores range 020 the initial chest ct findings and clinical characteristics were compared among the disease severity groups uncomplicated mild and severe continuous variables were represented as means and standard deviations or median and range while categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages chi-square test was used for categorical variables t test was used for continuous variables and nonparametric rank test was used for non-conforming variables the clinical outcome event of interest in this study was patient recovery and hospital discharge data were censored in events such as death or discharge without recovery univariate cox proportional hazard regression analysis was first used to explore the association of ct findings age sex and laboratory-testing with the length of hospitalization until the occurrence of the outcome event or the end of follow-up for those who had not been discharged during the study period then variables with p values  02 in univariate analysis were used to further analyze the associations with the clinical course by multivariable cox proportional hazard regression analysis variables such as total lung severity score duration between the symptom onset and presentationct examination time and number of lung lobes affected were collapsed into binary data by grouping them by the median of each data for cox regression analysis because the outcome event for the analysis was defined as recovery and hospital discharge hazard ratio hr values  1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at 4 weeks and longer time until discharge compared with the reference category in addition the univariable unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted kaplan-meier curves were used for displaying the cumulative incidence of discharge with recovery for the identified factors all statistical analyses were performed using spss 200 ibm corp armonk ny usa and medcalc 190 medcalc software ltd ostend belgium software p  005 was considered statistically significant three patients had uncomplicated illness 61 patients had mild disease and 8 patients had severe disease fourteen patients initially had negative nucleic acid tests that were subsequently positive patients had been admitted to the hospital for 4 to 27 days median 17 days thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period and the median length of the clinical course was 155 days range 9 to 25 days for those who remained hospitalized at the end of this investigation the median length of hospitalization was 175 days range 4 to 27 days no patient died during the study period among those with covid-19 the severe patients were older than patients with mild and uncomplicated illness p  0001 laboratory testing at initial hospital-visit indicated that 306 of patients had low lymphocyte counts table 1 the median interval time between the initial ct and the symptom onset was 3 days range 112 days among all patients 222 had ggo 236 had ggo and consolidation 83 exhibited consolidation 42 had ggo and linear opacities 56 had consolidation and linear opacities and 319 had all three signs 611 of patients had involvement of three or more lobes and 750 of patients had bilateral abnormalities in addition three patients had a negative initial ct but positive nucleic acid tests with fever or sore throat as the only clinical manifestation the ct findings are detailed in table 2 figure 1 shows the serial ct images of three patients with 41 47 and 66 years of age respectively on follow-up ct the 66-year-old patient had a higher total severity score than that of the two younger patients  5 score vs 1 score and did not meet the guideline criteria to be discharged univariable cox regression analysis indicated that seven variables ie age onset time lesion characteristics number of lung lobes affected bilateral involvement lung severity score and lymphocyte count correlated with the length of hospitalization with a p value  020 table 3 multivariable cox regression further found that the lung severity score and lymphocyte count were independently correlated with the event of discharge with recovery table 3 the adjusted hr value of the lung severity score  4 vs  4 as the reference category and lymphocyte count reduced vs normal or elevated as the reference category were 041 95 confidence interval ci 018092 p  0031 and 014 95 ci 003060 p  0008 respectively in addition the unadjusted kaplan-meier analysis showed that the cumulative incidences of discharge with recovery in the groups with lung severity score  4 and in the group with lung severity score  4 on day 24 were 733 and 418 respectively fig 2a the cumulative incidence of discharge with recovery on day 25 in the group with normal or elevated lymphocyte count and in the group with reduced lymphocyte was 874 and 163 respectively fig 2b in this paper we used the baseline ct and clinical features to explore which factors related to the clinical course in patients with covid-19 pneumonia results indicated that older patients may have more severe disease higher lung severity score and lower lymphocyte count were found to be independently associated with a significantly lower rate of discharge these findings support the role of ct imaging and clinical indices at initial hospital-visit for potentially predicting the hospitalization time of patients with covid-19 pneumonia during the observation time there were 8 patients with severe disease who were older than patients with mild and uncomplicated illness this result was consistent with previous data 8 similar to the sars-cov and the mers-cov the 2019-ncov appears to cause more severe disease in older patients 1314 therefore elderly patients should be closely monitored meanwhile it has been observed that the main manifestations of initial ct in covid-19 patients were ggo ggo with consolidation and bilateral lung involvement consistent with prior studies 681516 these findings likely correlate pathologically with edema inflammatory infiltrates pneumocyte hyperplasia and organization during an exudative and proliferative acute-phase of covid-19 pneumonia 17 among the ct findings lung injury severity score was found to correlate with the length of clinical course results indicated that the cumulative incidence of recovery and hospital discharge in group with lung severity scores  4 733 was significantly higher than in those with scores  4 612 within the four weeks one study regarding covid-19 related acute respiratory disease suggested that interstitial abnormalities seen on ct on admission were significantly correlated with the patients endpoints such as discharge intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation 10 our study also shows that initial ct findings correlate with the clinical course in patients with covid-19 pneumonia in addition to the imaging findings laboratory findings are also important factors to consider 10 this study found that lymphocyte counts correlate with the clinical course of covid-19 the cumulative incidence of recovery and hospital discharge in patients with normal or elevated lymphocyte count was 874 within four weeks which was significantly higher than that in patients with decreased lymphocyte count 163 these results were consistent with previous reports 1018 as lymphopenia is an essential characteristic of impaired immunity 19 huang et al 20 found lymphopenia in 63 patients and a cytokine storm profile in those who were critically ill the combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant immune response may have an impact on the severity of illness similar to what has been proven in sars and mers 20 therefore this study suggests that regular observation of lymphocyte counts in patients with covid-19 is beneficial for the detection of disease progression and guiding clinical decision-making and adjustment of treatment it is worth noting that among the patients who were discharged 3 had a negative ct but positive nucleic acid tests at presentation and all had uncomplicated illness these patients initially had fever or sore throat as the only clinical manifestation interestingly all patients had positive findings on their second ct all three patients were recovered and discharged at the end of follow-up it is speculated that for these patients the virus primarily affected the upper respiratory tract instead of the lower respiratory tract and with treatment their symptoms improved quickly therefore ct scan may correlate with the clinical course by identifying the different patterns and characteristics of the infection this paper has some limitations firstly the sample size of the study is small and larger samples are needed to further clarify the findings second we did not analyze the occurrence of adverse events such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the current study because there was such a small number of adverse events it was not possible to analyze them thus a follow-up study with more patients may allow for analysis of such events third further follow-up is required to evaluate the outcomes of patients with continued hospitalization status fourth the clinical course may be affected by multiple other factors than the disease course or prognosis itself such as administrative and logistical factors given the fact that covid-19 is spreading worldwide the treatment status for patients in epidemic foci may be affected by the administrative and logistical factors due to the large number of patients however in non-epidemic areas the number of patients are far less than that of patients in epidemic areas the government and hospitals have reliable administrative and logistical support therefore in non-focus areas the results may have fewer confounding variables and be a better reference for research in conclusion lung severity score  4 and reduced lymphocyte count at initial evaluation were independently associated with a substantially lower rate of recovery and hospital discharge at four weeks and more extended hospitalization in patients admitted for covid-19 pneumonia  modelling the downhill of the sars-cov-2 in italy and a universal forecast of the epidemic in the world gabriele martelloni gianluca martelloni  in a previous article 1 we have described the temporal evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy in the time window february 24-april 1 as we can see in 1 a generalized logistic equation captures both the peaks of the total infected and the deaths in this article our goal is to study the missing peak ie the currently infected one or total currently positive after the april 7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked so we decided to generalize the model introducing new parameters moreover we adopt a similar approach used in 1 for the estimation of deaths in order to evaluate the recoveries in this way introducing a simple conservation law we define a model with 4 populations total infected currently positives recoveries and deaths therefore we propose an alternative method to a classical sird model for the evaluation of the sars-cov-2 epidemic however the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for italy germany and usa and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized logistic model used in 1 for these three countries we think that this trend could be useful for a future epidemic of this coronavirus  we briefly review the historical evolution of the sars-cov-2 in the earth in early december the sars-cov-2 appeared in wuhan china the disease caused by the new coronavirus has a name covid-19 where co stands for corona vi for virus d for disease and 19 indicates the year in which it occurred the oms director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus announced it on february 11 2020 during the extraordinary press conference dedicated to the virus the appearance of new pathogenic viruses for humans previously circulating only in the animal world is a widely known phenomenon called spill over and it is thought that it may also be at the basis of the origin of the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 the scientific community is currently trying to identify the source of the infection on december 31 2019 the municipal health commission of wuhan china reported to the oms a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in the city of wuhan in the chinese province of hubei on january 9 2020 the chinese center for disease prevention and control cdc reported that a new coronavirus initially called 2019-ncov and now called sars-cov-2 has been identified as the causative agent and has been rendered publishes the genomic sequence oms on march 11 2020 declared that covid-19 can be defined as a pandemic after notification of the epidemic by china italy immediately recommended postponing unnecessary flights to wuhan and subsequently with the spread of the epidemic to all of china consequently the latter has canceled all flights from wuhan this disease does not save italy that has become a protected area with the dpcm signed on the evening of 9 march by the prime minister giuseppe conte who has extended the restrictive measures already applied for lombardy and the 14 northern provinces most affected by the coronavirus infection to the whole national territory the new action comes into force on march 10 and will take effect until april 3 among the main innovations it limits the movement of people blocks sporting events suspends teaching activities in schools and universities throughout the country until april 3 with the new ordinance of 22 march 2020 issued by the minister of health and the minister of the interior from 22 march people are prohibited from moving with public or private trasportation in a municipality other than that in which they are located except for proven work needs absolute urgency or for health reasons 2 many growth models have been very recently applied to study the evolution of the covid-19 infection 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  in 1 we tried to analyze the time evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy using a logistic model 11 at the beginning of the study and after with a generalization of that model the logistic behaviour assumes that growth stops when maximum sustainable population density is reached through the carrying capacity k that depends on the environmental conditions for example the ordinances of the prime minister gconte the peoples hygiene habits are encoded in the carrying capacity k we observe as the generalized model of 1 works very well until the april 7 after this date the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked at first in italy pharyngeal swabs were initially made only on seriously ill people this choice gave us the possibility to have a sample of the infected that we can describe with a single population model after april 7 it becomes impossible so we decided to use a different model to describe the new trend of the data and try to give different scenarios of the descent phase of the virus in italy in the time window february 24-may 5 in 1 we described two different peaks the peak of the infected and the deaths one in this paper we analyze the peak of the currently infected and the downhill of the propagation of the sars-cov-2 to do this we define a new model similar to a sird see for example 7  but without the population of supsceptibles because there are no criteria on defining the susceptible ones we consider three couple differential equations for infected it deaths dt and recovery rt with the following conservation law where p t represents the currently infected or positive in the last part of this article we observe as the following ratio infected it i  over swabs st i  is the most important parameter to describe the evolution of the sars-cov-2 indeed we can describe the trend of this quantity only with a generalized logistic model with 4 parameters even with data after april 7 this behavior suggest us to use this model for a future epidemic of this virus if we will able to perform a greater and constant number of swabs everyday using this model we may have better control over the contagion curve and consequently over the number of deaths our idea is to use a model that adapts to the data of the problem we explain better lets consider the following data  1 daily data of march 14 3497 new infected 11682 swabs  2 daily data of april 17 3493 new infected 65705 swabs  3 probable case fatality rate cfr of the virus is rougly 1  2 3 million of infected at april 17 with 172434 detected  4 time delay between hospitalization and death t d 4 days parameter extrapolated also in 1  5 time delay between the onset of symptoms and healing t r 14  42 days a very oscillating parameter some comments about these data the points 1 and 2 describe perfectly that the sample of infected is not clean at the beginning of the contagion the swabs are performed only on the severe infected after 1 month the number of swabs are increased of a factor 6 and consequently also the midly infected are detected point 3 tells us that there is probably an incredible number of asymptomatics as a source of severe infected we have no control about it points 4 5 indicate that while the death data is under control the healed data are very oscillating in time finally the points 6 tells us that contribution of asymptomatics portrayed in 1  changes in time indeed from april 6-7 14-15 days after the second ld ie an incubation time  the generalized logistic description fails after these considerations we have decided to couple the following equations with a conservation law where p t represents the currently infected or positive the parameters r 0 represents the rates of growth of epidemic k is the carrying capacity for the classical logistic model  is a constant in order to have a power low initial growth before ld  is the exponent of the second term of equation 1 that represents the influence of asymptomatic a correction of the quadratic term of logistic and  are the constant parameters considering the influence of the government measures 1  k f is a proportionality constant between deaths and total number of infected while t d and t r are the delays of deaths and recoveries respect to infected respectively the constant a represents the contribution of asymptomatic people as introduced in 1 and finally t 0 is the time of ld start a brief consideration about the function f t the great variability of t r suggest us that only the parameter t r is not sufficient to describe correctly the function rt so we decided to introduce a coefficient time dependent we present two different scenarios in fig1 we consider a linear approximation f t  a  bt while in fig2 we consider a quadratic approximation f t  a  bt  ct 2  this choice is not random indeed considering the behaviour of the recovery time series in which a single recovery can heal with some delay in a window variable from few days to two months the correct modeling could be a regressive linear function of type rt  n i1 a i  it  t i  eventually introducing also no-linear term in the series but in this way we introduce many degree of freedom how many are the coefficient a i of the regressive function therefore we consider an approximation using the two functions f t considered above we desumed the following values for the principal parameters by means of 100 stochastic simulation using direct method gillespie algorithm adapted to nonautonomous differential equations t r  8  1 for linear approximation t r  12  1 for quadratic approximation some comments about these values with respect to 1 we observe that the figure 1  the scenario with a linear growth for the recoveries the black curve represents the deaths the red one for the infected the green one for the recovery and the pink one for the currently infected figure 2  the scenario with a quadratic growth for the recoveries the black curve represents the deaths the red one for the infected the green one for the recovery and the pink one for the currently infected peak of the severe infected is correctly estimated ie t 0  24  26 march and also the peak of the deaths ie t 0  28  30 march also the time delay t d remained the same the same t r approaches the experimental lower limit in quadratic approximation with respect to the logistic model r 0 is increased while the coefficient  drops from the value 2 to the value 184 ie we are considering different models in fig 1-2 we observe as the peak of currently infected is close to april 20 and finally we give us our prevision for a linear growth for the recoveries close to july 10 for a quadratic growth we have close to june 20 the estimated numbers iend and dend are very close but it is not surprising the eqs 3 and 4 for total infected head the model while f t is present in eq 6 that is only a proportionality equation obviously a linear approximation for ft leads to a slower recovery curve and therefore a small increase of infected now we consider the following parameter that represents the number of infected normalized with the number of swabs st i  we study this quantity with generalized logistic equation used in 1  where  r 0  k and a have the same meaning used in the previous section compared to the previous section we observe as studying the parameter i norm t i  we can describe the contagion with a simple logistic equation and without the phenomenological terms introduced in eqs3- 6  in order to calibrate this model in the best way possible we use two algorithms the first one based on simulated annealing 16 and the second one on optimized simplex 17  we evaluate the function error defined as where x i is the real data at day i y i p is the correspondent output of the model depending of vector parameter p and w i is a generic weight that we can use or can be equal to one for our purpose we adopt as weight the derivative of data or the data at time day i the use of derivative allows to calibrate better on average the curve while the use of the data as weight permit to calibrate better the data of the last part of the curve in fig 3-4 we describe the situation of italy at may 5 while fig 5-6 describe describe the data of italy from which we have subtracted the data of lombardia we give you the following values for the parameters of fig 3 r 0  0175  0015  for the parameters of fig 4 r 0  0178  0015 for the parameters of fig 5 r 0  0143  0015 and finally for the parameters of fig 6 r 0  0143  0015 we observe as the quantity i norm t is probably the most important quantity studying the evolution of the virus we explain better the contribution of asymptomatic people is essentially the same in lombardia and in the rest of italy while the coefficient r 0 is larger if we consider italy compared to the scenario of italy minus lombardy this consideration is extremely coherent with the data the infected of lombardia region represent the 37 of all the italian infected moreover the ratio infected over swabs is a very reliable parameter we can describe correctly the italian situation only with 4 parameter and with a wellknown model we stress that in the future if a nation is ready to carry out a large and constant number of swabs every day using this model we can have a reliable forecast of the epidemic we consider also the scenario represented by eq 19 for germany in fig  7 and for usa in fig 8  for germany we study the time evolution of the sars-cov-2 in the time window march 8-may 11 and we obtain the following parameters for usa we study the contagion in the time window march 10-may 11 and we have these values for the parameters a brief comment about these parameters the values r 0 are similar to each other and lower than the italian value with and without lombardia data this is completely coherent with the various scenarios the apparent lethality  apparent cfr  is approximately 45 in germany and 6 in the united states while in italy is 14 the contribution of asymptomatic a seems to be similar for all countries however the surprising result is that the trend of the virus is captured by the same differential equation ie eq 19 for all considered countries this could mean that the virus always has the same type of behavior but at different speed lets try to justify this idea a different speed may depend on population density work habits and the number of swabs at the beginning of the epidemic about the last consideration we imagine to immediately carry out a large number of swabs knowing as soon as possible the largest possible number of infected means limiting the contagion and therefore the propagation speed of virus we described the evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy in the time window february 24-may 5 to do this we have built a phenomenological growth model adapted on the data of civil protection with respect to a classical sird model we did not consider the supsceptible population because there are not medical evidences on which sample of the population can be ill so we have considered three couple differential equations for infected it deaths dt and recovery rt with the a conservation law including the currently positive population pt as the time delay between the onset of symptoms and healing t r days is a very oscillating parameter we introduced a sort of regressive function f t to modelling better this delay so we described two scenarios of the end of epidemic  iend  247471 dend  35235 close to july 10 for f t linearly approximated  iend  243766 dend  34682 close to june 20 for f t in a quadratic approximation obviously a linear approximation for ft leads to a slower recovery curve and therefore a small increase of infected in the second part of this manuscript we described the time evolution of the normalized data that represents the number of infected normalized with the number of swabs st i  we have studied this parameter on four different scenarios  italy  data of italy minus data of lombardia  about 37 of the italian infected belong to the lombardia region   usa  germany so we have found that all the evolutions are governed by the same generalized logistic equation 1  suggesting an universal feature of the propagation of sars-cov-2 virus in particular the value of the parameter r 0 is in descending order compatible with the respective apparent cfr  acfr   for italy

important parameter to control the propagation of the virus for a new inauspicious propagation of this virus in the world because knowing its universal feature we can forward know the number of infected preparing a relevant number of swabs  do we know when to end isolation of persons affected with covid-19 dror dicker tatiana kournos dana marcoviciu rachel golan   the pathogen responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this novel coronavirus was first detected in wuhan china in late december 2019 1 since initial detection of the virus more than 1800000 cases of covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide and over 400000 persons have recovered the first case in israel was reported on february 27 2020 to date over 13500 have been diagnosed and more than 4000 have recovered 2 initially during the outbreak of covid-19 in israel all persons who tested positive were admitted to hospitals nowadays all those with mild disease are isolated in designated hotels whereas those with moderate and severe disease are admitted to designated internal medicine or intensive care unit departments within hospitals the criterion for discharge from isolation is two consecutive negative tests of sars-cov-2 rna detection one difficulty faced by clinicians as well as by patients is the unknown time-frame of hospitalization until discharge of symptomatic patients the aims of our report are to offer a time-frame for ending the isolation of patients affected by covid-19 and to describe the time to recovery according to demographic characteristics sex differences and coexisting conditions we describe the dynamics of the disease that paralleled changes in the viral load based on sars-cov-2 rna detection during february and march 2020 we followed the 20 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection who were treated following a diagnosis of covid-19 and who recovered from the infection during march 2020 all the diagnoses were by semi-quantitative rt-pcr on nasopharyngeal swabs we assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from nasopharyngeal samples that were obtained once daily for the first 3 days following hospital admission and once every 2 or 3 days until discharge clinical specimens for covid-19 diagnostic testing were obtained in accordance with us centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines nasopharyngeal samples were tested with the assay developed by the cdc 3 and based on the world health organization standard all the samples were refrigerated and shipped to rabin medical center where rna extraction rt-pcr and the virus isolation and titration procedures were performed envelope protein gene e rna-dependent rna polymerase gene rdrp and nucleocapsid n gene were measured by the rt-pcr allplextm 2019-ncov 45 if one target was detected the assay was reported as positive recovery was defined as two negative measurements for all three genes here we describe the days to recovery from the first day of appearance of symptoms local ethical board approval and informed consent for analyzing routine procedures during the outbreak was waved at the time by the director-general of the israel ministry of health descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data the results are reported as means and standard deviations or ranges categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages we used chi square and fishers exact test to study differences between men and women between persons older and younger than the median age and between those with and without elevated body temperature 38 during hospitalization we calculated a morbidity score for each patient according to the number of chronic diseases at the time of admission according to this score we examined the association between morbidity and time to recovery the kruskal-wallis test was used to compare those with and without comorbidities upon admission no imputation was made for missing data all the analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics the population consisted of 8 women and 12 men the mean age was 490 171 years range 18-75 years yet women were older 602 vs 414 p0012 thirteen 65 had a body temperature above 38c at admission 6 30 had hypertension 3 15 type 2 diabetes 9 45 dyslipidemia and three were current smokers only one patient was treated by chloroquine zinc and azithromycin during hospitalization the mean time to discharge was 17 days the range was 13-21 days the mean length of hospital stay was longer for patients who presented with a body temperature above 38c during hospitalization n13 than for those who did not have an elevated body temperature 175 vs 167 days p06 accordingly the number of days to negative detection of each gene was longer among those with an elevated body temperature than among those without gene e 155 vs 153 gene n 175 vs 167 and gene rdrp 158 vs 156 p005 for all stratifying our population by median age above and below 44 years the time to full recovery was shorter for the younger than the older patients 170 vs 173 days the time to negative detection of each gene was also shorter among the younger than the older patients for example 144 vs 167 days p008 for gene e elevated body temperature presented in 78 79 of the older patients and 54 611 of the younger patients 
figure 1
a describes the time in days until a complete negative result negative detection of all three genes according to patient sex although older the women exhibited a shorter time to recovery than did the men 167 vs 175 days p06 we further examined the time from admission until negative detection of each gene figure 1b shows the time to recovery in all three detected genes by hospitalization day from the first day of symptoms all genes e rdrp and n correlated with the sum of days leading to discharge the strongest correlation was for gene n r078 r082 r10 respectively p0001 for all the time to recovery was longer for patients with hypertension or lung disease compared to those without hypertension for those with hypertension n6 the number of days to recovery was 185 vs 166 p013 and for each of the genes e rdrp and n 178 vs 144 p003 177 vs 149 p005 and 185 vs 166 p013 respectively in patients with no chronic illnesses at the time of admission n11 negative detections of gene e and rdrp were after 145 and 149 days respectively this contrasts to 164 and 167 days respectively for those with comorbidities upon admission full recovery was determined in those without comorbidities after 170 days when gene n was also not detected and for those with comorbidities after 174 days the time to discharge after the onset of covid-19 symptoms is two weeks minimum recovery was longer for patients with comorbidities especially hypertension or those with elevated body temperature during hospitalization women seem to recover faster than men some studies have reported sex-differences in patients with covid-19 6 suggesting that men might be affected at a higher rate and more severely than women in italy 82 of 1591 patients were men 7 moreover among critically ill patients in china 67 were men 8 although the reasons for a possibly lower rate of infection among women are not fully understood we suggest that women once affected might recover more quickly in our cohort patients with comorbidities and specifically those with hypertension were more likely to present a longer recovery whether patients with hypertension are at increased risk for covid-19 infection has been recently debated 9 among 1043 patients in italy 49 had hypertension 7 of the three genes measured by the rt-pcr gene n was most correlated with full recovery from covid-19 in a recent study of 9 patients 10 seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50 of the patients and in 14 days in all of them but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load this emphasizes the need for a method that correlates between serological and rt-pcr tests to our knowledge this is the first report to offer a time-frame for recovery from covid-19 and the end of isolation depending on baseline and hospitalization conditions of the patients all authors have no conflict of interest  estimation of the probability of reinfection with covid-19 by the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed-undetectable-susceptible model travis sanchez gunther eysenbach corey basch mohammad bahrami amin geogre yuan alexander victor okhuese   the coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the global economy and on behavioral practices of people worldwide until its early detection in wuhan china in 2019 the virus was unknown to the scientific world and the extent of its damage was unmeasurable however upon its outbreak various research including but not limited to victor 1 and batista 2 began to predict the scale that the virus would hit the world the ratio of the death to recovery rate has seemingly been a positive proportion with the slow but deliberate efforts by governments of developed and developing countries to control slow and possibly halt the further spread of the virus contact tracing and testing has reached millions of people with the sensitivity of the testing approach the polymerase chain reaction pcr the infected and exposed populations were easily identified for isolation and quarantine respectively in a bid to slow the curve of secondary infections and manage the critically affected infected group meanwhile a common trend that seems to show a ray of hope in the fight against the coronavirus was the unattended recovery of infected and exposed patients and despite the absence of a food and drug administration-approved vaccine this recovery rate seems to be encouraging however as the recovery rate and infection rate continues to increase the question that has eluded health care workers the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization who is if there will be reinfection after a patient with covid-19 has recovered clinically in the literature victor 1 nesteruk 3 and ming et al 4 focus has been placed on the outbreak exposure and the rate of infection for covid-19 by the use of various models to study the trend of the pandemic in their studies nesteruk 3 and ming et al 4 used the popular susceptible-infectious-removed sir model to obtain optimal values for the model parameters for use with a statistical approach and hence predicted the number of infected susceptible and removed persons over time this model approach by nesteruk 3 has been a major breakthrough in modelling disease control and has been used by several authors eg ming et al 4 and victor 1 however although there exists a worldwide interest in contact tracing testing isolating those that are exposed to covid-19 and estimating and projecting the rate of worldwide infections what is more interesting is an estimation that could evaluate the probability of reinfection by those who have recovered from covid-19 therefore in this study the approach developed by victor 1 based on an age-structured model developed and used by victor and oduwole 5 for hivaids transmission in africa was adopted which is a deterministic endemic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed-undetectable-susceptible seirus model the seirus model was used due to the resulting solutions that captured the relevant parameters for the exposed and untransmitable classes which are not present in the sir model as used by nesteruk 3 and batista 2 the resulting equations from the seirus model are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations used to capture the susceptible rate rate of exposure infectious rate and the rate of recovery in addition the equations capture the rate of reinfection which is captured in the undetectable class that is clinically ascertained by the pcr testing approach for the recovered population numerical experiments with relevant simulation showing how the variation of the reproductive number r0 affects the number of infected individuals were carried out as well as a projection for the rate of reinfection by the recovered class conscious effort to evaluate the new deterministic seirus model was done to reduce the r0 to zero and possibly halt the spread of the disease thereby leading to an endemic equilibrium and eradication of the disease in the future the worldwide covid-19 pandemic and the lack or inefficiency of purposeful and result-based interventions are great calls for other empirical and scientific interventions that seek to review strategic models and recommendations of social and scientific research for disease control although previous studies have been tailored toward the epidemiology and the disease-free equilibrium dfe where the r0 of the infectious population is at its bare minimum this study seeks to evaluate the impact of a new endemic deterministic model on the endemic equilibrium while taking into consideration the possibility of the recovered population being undetectable and fit to be moved to the susceptible class which will therefore imply zero secondary infection of the disease worldwide in summary this study aims to use the new deterministic endemic seirus compartmental model for covid-19 dynamics which combines quarantine and observation procedures and behavioral change and social distancing in the control and eradication of the disease in the most exposed subpopulations to predict the chances of reinfection by the recovered class as suggested in victor 1 and victor and oduwole 5 the variables and parameters for the investigation of the stability analysis of the equilibrium state for the new deterministic endemic model are given in tables 1 and 2 the following assumptions as suggested in victor 1 and victor and oduwole 5 help in the derivation of the model this study uses the deterministic endemic model where a susceptible class is a class that is yet to be infected but is open to infection as interactions with members of the i class continue an infected individual is one who has contracted the coronavirus and is at some stage of infection a removed individual is one that is confirmed to have the virus with its expected symptoms and is under quarantine while following relevant observation procedures a member of the undetectable class is one that has been removed does not secrete the virus anymore and has satisfied the who standard to be in the undetectable class the following diagram 1 describes the dynamic of the seirus framework and will be useful in the formulation of model equations 

 the following equations are a system of coupled homogenous differential equations for projecting the detection rate of the presence of the virus in the clinically prescribed recovered population based on the assumptions and the flow diagram previously mentioned 

 the incidence rate or force of infection at time t denoted by bt in the population is given by 

 the model equations in proportion according to victor 1 was adopted for this study as follows 

 however s  e  i  r  u  1 equations 10-14 are the model equations in proportions which define the prevalence of infection the dfe state of the endemic seirus model is obtained by setting the left-hand sides of equations 10-14 to zero while setting the disease components e  i  r  u  0 leading to equations 15 and 16 

 0s
16 after substituting equation 16 into 15 we have  which makes 0 we then take 15 where s0 or 0    s  s2
17 simplifying this further gives us as2  bs  c  0 18 in equation 18 a1 b and c 

 therefore the solution for the equations in 18 are given by 

 ignoring the native values of  and other stringent conditions there exists a unique trivial and dfe state at  given by 00 the solution of equation 19 satisfies equation 18 identically in the event that patients recover from covid-19 it is assumed that they are disease free for at least 14 days after their last clinical test shows that they have clinically recovered from the virus hence to study the behavior of the equations 10-14 around the dfe state e000000 we resort to the linearized stability approach from victor 1 which gives us a jacobian  transformation of the form 

 hence according to gerald 6 the determinant of the jacobian matrix  is given by the recursive definition of a 5 x 5 matrix defined as 

 from equation 20 det0 22 similarly from the trace of the jacobian matrix  given in equation 20 we have 

 hence since def0 and trace0 which does satisfy the prescribed threshold criteria based on gerald 6 then the dfe e0 for covid-19 does satisfy the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability for the recovered population this implies that the pandemic of covid-19 as declared by who 7 does not have a curative vaccine so far and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observation procedures therefore for the recovered population the chances of reinfection appear to be uncertain though nearly impossible unless regular clinical tests are not accurately administered the basic r0 is defined as the number of secondary infections that one infectious individual would create over the duration of the infectious period provided that everyone else is susceptible r01 is a threshold and if the number is below it the generation of secondary cases is insucient to maintain the infection in human communities if r01 the number of infected individuals will decrease from one generation to the next and the disease dies out if r01 the number of infected individuals will increase from one generation to the next and the disease will persist to compute the basic reproductive number r0 of the model with the incidence rate for the recovered population assumed to vanish such that b0 we employed the next generation method as applied by deikmann et al 8 and van den driessche and watmough 9 

 fi and vi are the rate of appearances of new infections in compartment i and the transfer of individuals into and out of compartment i by all means respectively using the linearization method the associated matrices at dfe e0 and after taking partial derivatives as defined by 

 f is nonnegative and v is a nonsingular matrix in which both are the m x m matrices defined by 

 here 1i jm and m is the number of infected classes in particular m2 and we have 

 the inverse of v is given as 

 the next matrix will then be denoted by fv1 given as 

 we find the eigenvalues of fv1 by setting the determinant fv1  i  0 

 the characteristics polynomial is 2 the characteristics equation is given as 20 we solve the characteristics equation for the eigenvalues 12 where r0 is the maximum of the two eigenvalues 12 hence the basic r0 is the dominant eigenvalues of fv1 thus we have that r00 26 the basic reproductive number r00 of equation 26 shows that with no incidence rate in the recovered population there is no chance of a secondary infection by patients with covid-19 who have been clinically declared negative and free from the virus ie the virus is completely cleared from their system hence although there currently exists no clinical vaccine for the cure of covid-19 with equation 26 there is a high chance of zero cases of reinfection after clinical recovery from the virus  according to the who 10 the total cases of covid-19 worldwide stands at about 900000 with a total of about 190000 recovered and the current total deaths is about 44000 from about 172 countries figures 1 and 2 show the cumulative case count per country 11 and worldwide 11 respectively the age-structured deterministic model in equations 10-14 was solved numerically using the runge-kutta-fehllberg fourth to fifth order method and implemented using maple software maplesoft the model equations were first transformed into proportions thus reducing the model equations to 10 differential equations the parameters used in the implementation of the model are shown in table 3 parameters were chosen in consonance with the threshold values obtained in the stability analysis of the dfe state of the model hence from equation 26 the reproductive number r00 means there is a 100 chance of zero secondary reinfections from the recovered compartment of the covid-19 patient group when a reinfected population interacts by contact with the susceptible population figure 3 shows the rate of recovery and rate of infection for covid-19 and figure 4 shows the rate of reinfection the analysis clearly shows that the secondary infection rate satisfies the local and worldwide stability criteria and the dfe for an endemic situation unlike the respiratory syncytial virus which causes a significant respiratory disease often in those 5 years or younger covid-19 is estimated to burden more than 10000 people worldwide although the stability analysis shows that there is no chances of secondary reinfection by the recovered class the rate of the infectious will continue to rise asymptotically over a long period of time and there after begin to slide in a normal trajectory if no vaccine is available batista 2 and nesteruk 3 focused their study on the impact of the infectious class in the subpopulation with the sir model and forecasted a rapid geometric growth in the spread of the virus worldwide and a subsequent progression in the rate of recovery among the exposed and infectious groups according to victor 1 the model equations that exhibit the dfe e0 state for covid-19 satisfies the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability when the basic r00 for an endemic situation this implies that the covid-19 pandemic as declared by who 7 does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observation procedures however with the various make shift treatments social distancing measures and quarantine strategies being adopted the recovery rate will keep rising slowly but steadily over a long period of time therefore as the recovery rate continues to grow steadily the number of recovered patients who have been clinically declared free of the virus by the pcr test are also declared uninfectious as long as the virus is completely cleared from their system and the rate of detection will vanish making the rate of secondary infection r00 as long as the incidence rate b0 there is a need for a dedicated effort from individual populations governments health organizations policy makers and stakeholders the world is hardly rid of covid-19 and further spread is eminent the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery until a curative vaccine is developed with the worldwide health sector in a bid to tackle covid-19 this study gives encouragement to the policy makers and public health care sectors as there is zero secondary reinfections by the recovered population therefore the policy makers and public health sectors can enhance contact tracking tracing and testing to improve the isolation and quarantine of the infected and exposed classes in addition the health sector could use covid-19 antibodies from the samples of the recovered class to develop effective vaccines for the virus however since the hypothesis of zero reinfections has not been clinically proven further observations should be carried out on the recovered class in clusters to study the progression of the exposed with the re-exposed subpopulations to see by clinical examination the possibilities of reinfection and thereby promote the use of these antibodies for vaccine creation this study was limited by the variability of data available at the time of developing this paper meanwhile from the statistics the infected cases and fatalities were projected to increase geometrically therefore the findings of this study are based on sample data taken at the time of the study in addition with the seirus model and the discovery that the r00 we concluded that there are no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes however reports from worldwide public health data have shown that there has been a few rare cases of reinfection of some from the recovered class and they are suspected to be reinfected by a rare type of the coronavirus but not covid-19  treatment efficacy analysis of traditional chinese medicine for novel coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 an empirical study from wuhan hubei province china erdan luo daiyan zhang hua luo bowen liu keming zhao yonghua zhao ying bian yitao wang   a novel coronavirus named covid-19 was identified in december 2019 in wuhan china which caused infectious pneumonia and spread rapidly however there has been no consensus on the nomenclature of novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp from the perspective of traditional chines medicine tcm so far academician tong xiaolin suggested that the disease should be named as cold-dampness pestilence  1 and academician wang qi called the disease pulmonary pestilence  in the manual for traditional chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment of ncp 2 in general there is an agreement on the opinion that ncp belongs to the category of epidemic disease  in tcm as the special climate of wuhan where the local temperature in last winter was higher than that in previous winter and the rainfall was more frequent than snowfall the syndromes of ncp patients often presented the characteristics of dampness pathogen  in tcm integrating the analysis resulted from professor liu qingquan and dr xiang qiong 3 4 we consider that ncp covid-19 should be defined as dampness toxin pestilence  dampness toxin  runs through the comprehensive pathology of ncp even in gansu a region with dry climate the researchers found that the characteristics of dampness pathogen from ncp patients were similar to those in wuhan 5 chinese medicine cm has accumulated abundant clinical experiences and effective formulas on the prevention and treatment of epidemic diseases in ming dynasty wu youke a famous chinese medicine doctor believed that the pathogen of epidemic disease was different from the six excesses  but was a kind of pestilent qi  that had high contagious and powerful toxic features pestilent qi is prone to encroaching specific organs and involving multiple organs failure and commonly breaks out in populated large cities in 2004 a clinical study including 524 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars showed that the duration of major symptoms in the group of patients treated by integrated chinese and western medicines was significantly shorter than those in the group treated by western medicine alone 6 the satisfied therapeutic effects of tcm in preventing and treating sars suggested the superiority of tcm on severe infectious diseases in march 2020 the diagnosis and treatment guideline of novel coronavirus pneumonia edition 7 was released by the national health commission nhc of peoples republic of china 7 in which qingfei paidu decoction qfpdd and other tcm formulas were recommended to treat ncp although it is necessary to consider the real pathological evolutions of patients based on local climatic features and individual physical characteristics of patients the inconsistency of syndrome types  is prone to producing cluttered chinese medicine formulas in the view of this the tcm symptom types in this study complied with those in the guideline from treatment to recovery period therefore this study aimed to figure out efficacy of tcm in treating ncp to explore the relationship of the tcms influence factors with patients individual characteristics and to optimize qfpdd and nhc-recommended formulas corresponding to the treatment and recovery period of ncp by using both statistics analysis and network pharmacological technology this study can not only partially reveal the therapeutic mechanisms of tcm through the corresponding relationships among formula medicine and syndrome but also provide scientific evidence for screening and optimizing tcm formulas for the treatment of ncp data of 54 patients with ncp namely sars-cov-2 pneumonia covid-19 undergoing cms treatment originated from the department of infectious disease in jihe hospital from wuhan during january 24 to february 17 the information about patients age gender symptoms temperature use of tcms and results of laboratory examinations during hospitalization were collected through hospital information system his the clinical characteristics of patients and frequency of cms use were described independent t test was used to measure the differences of clinical characteristics among patients in varied demographic groups and paired t test was used to measure the differences of patients blood test results between admission and discharge of hospital which could indicate the effect of cms correlation analysis was applied to investigate the relevance among various symptoms and tcm clinical features multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital stay the compound information of all the 21 chinese medicines in qfpdd were collected there were one to three herbs selected as the sovereign medicinal  to represent the main effect of the recommended formulas of five disease stages mild moderate severe critical and recovery stages for target prediction and active compound ctarget t network construction we input the smiles of the compounds into online tools similarity ensemble approach sea to predict the putative targets the software cytoscape version 370 was used to construct active compounds-targets network and the network parameters of each element were analysed based on the plug-in network analyzer for further analysis a web-based gene set analysis toolkit was applied for the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway enrichment analysis of putative targets parameter settings were as follows homo sapiens in organism of interest over-representation analysis ora in method of interest and kegg in functional database tcm comprehension on pathological evolution of ncp and medication paradigm were analyzed based on syndrome differentiation as ncp belongs to the category of epidemic disease the pathogen is generally attributed to dampness toxin according to the main symptom characteristics of this disease tcm believes that ncp locates in lung and is closely related to spleen and stomach and its pathological changes involve in heart liver and kidney in the later stages dampness pathogen can change into cold-dampness  pathogen following the yin body constitution  and also become the dampness-heat  pathogen following the yang body constitution  clinical observation shows that dampness toxin can directly invade into middle energizer  in partly ncp patients and leads to the dysfunction of qi movement if the treatment method is appropriate and sufficient healthy qi  gradually recovers the pathogen will be driven out consequently the patient will enter into the recovery period at the same time clinical manifestations appear some symptoms of qi and yin deficiency  thus the pathological evolution of ncp in tcm can be summarized as dampness toxin invading defense exterior  in early stage and then enters the lungs and influences spleen function eventually involves heart liver and kidney which causes yang qi collapse  by excess pathogen and yin and yang separates from each other  if the treatment is timely and suitable sufficient healthy qi can eliminate the pathogen syndromes with deficiency of qi and yin in lung and spleen will be manifested fig 1 although the pathogen between ncp and sars have certain similarities in virus origination the tcm pathogenesis of ncp and sars appear to be different table 1 except using cms treatment according to tcm different syndromes the application of achievements from modern pharmacological research on cms targeting the pathological changes of ncp at different periods will also improve therapeutic effects for example ephedra sinica stapf schizonepeta tenuifolia briq perillae folium and lonicerae japonicae flos have antipyretic and analgesic actions and ma xing shi gan decoction  arctium lappa l and poria cocos schw wolf are able to regulate immune function and suppress inflammatory cytokine storm suggesting that tcm plays a comprehensive beneficial regulating role in the treatment of ncp through multi-level and multi-pathways demographic characteristics of patients were shown in table 2 the average age of all the 54 patients was 5507 years old male patients 5203 years old were younger than female patients 6025 years old in average t

study there are 201 compounds in recommended formulas of five disease stages and 288 compounds in the qfpdd after screening comparing with the compound in sovereign medicinal we discovered kaempferol beta-sitosterol stigmasterol quercetin luteolin genkwanin diop isorhamnetin participated in three or more disease stages at the same time these compounds were not unique to a single chinese herbal medicine but many common cms comparing the compounds in qfpdd with those in recommended formulas of the first four disease stages seven of the eight compounds except isorhamnetin were found to be

150 types in severe stage 88 types in critical stage and 112 types in recovery stage totally there were 204 types of different targets in recommended formulas and 240 targets in qfpdd after comparing the putative targets of five disease stage it was found that 169 of the 204 targets were common targets among which 58 were involved in the treatment of all five disease stages by comparing qfpdd with

disease stages fig 2 and the degree value of a total of 25 targets was greater than 30 among which the first five were cyp1b1 esr1 esr2 ar and abcg2 respectively then a c-t network of qrpdd was constructed similarly by considering the large number of targets only 60 common targets in qfpdd and recommended formulas of the first four disease stages were selected for visualization fig 3 for the compounds kaempferol quercetin luteolin galangin luteolin isorhamnetin and the degree value were all greater than 30 for the targets the first five were cyp1b1 abcg2 ca7 ca4 and esr2 respectively the

presented in the first four diseases stages with a high enrichment rate as well as a low p value and the expression of arachidonic acid metabolism in the critical disease stages was the most obvious indicating that formulas were more inclined to inhibit pathogens in the critical diseases stage ovarian steroidogenesis exists mainly in severe and critical disease stages for qfpdd nitrogen

pathways generally the clinical results of our study showed that 54 ncp patients enhanced immune ability against covid-19 by detecting blood samples after tcm treatment and category of isrd appears to shorten patients hospitalization days firstly the hemogram changes of patients in this study can reflect the efficacy of tcm treatment on ncp in a certain extent as a common symptom among ncp patients the lymphocytopenia was observed in this study though it was not severe according to recent studies on clinical characteristics of ncp lymphocytopenia was one of the most common laboratory abnormalities observed in ncp patients and occurred in 703832 of patients 8 9 the abnormalities like lymphocytopenia suggested that covid-19 infection may be associated with cellular immune deficiency 9 thus the increase of lymphocyte during the tcm treatment in this study could be regarded as a result of tcm improving patients hemogram by adjusting immune system 10 in this study the average hospitalization time of 54 ncp patients in moderate type was 896 days under the treatment of tcm and the length of hospital stay was related to the tcm in category of isrd suggesting that chinese medicines could effectively shorten the pathological evolution of ncp as the pathogenesis of ncp in chinese medicine theory belongs to dampness and toxin and dampness pathogen mainly influence the digestive function of spleen stomach and intestine the primary therapeutic strategy focuses on improving digestive function for dispelling dampness pathogen additionally our study also found that abnormal digestion was associated with the clinical symptoms of fever and cough by correlation analysis which powerfully illustrated the relationship of the pathogenesis of ncp with the dysfunction of digestive system eg spleen stomach and intestine therefore our study demonstrates that chinese medicines with an effect of isrd should be beneficial to attenuate the pathological evolution of ncp interestingly the category of removing toxin did not account for the predominant relation with the length of hospital stay from the result of multiple linear regression analysis showing the therapeutic methods were primarily attributed to isrd rather than removing toxin the results indicated the function of chinese medicines on ncp treatment focus on strengthening sufficient healthy qi enhancing body immune ability instead of dispelling pathogen targeting against covid-19 one of supported evidences was that the number of leukocytes neutrophil lymphocyte and platelet significantly increased at the end of integrated treatment during rescuing critical ncp patients in wuhan academician li lanjuans team mentioned that it was important to maintain patients intestinal microenvironment balance and tcm had advantages on reducing intestinal bacterial migration to lung and secondary infection this view has been included into the diagnosis and treatment guideline of ncp edition 7 7 as the development of intestine and lung originate from the same source in embryonic stage studies indicate that bacterial and viral infections in lung can affect intestinal microenvironment through the gut-lung axis and vice versa in animal model of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome the intestinal specific bacteria such as bacteroides spp can directly transfer to lung through damaged intestinal barrier revealing that these two critical and high mortality diseases have a common pathogenesis mechanism 11 sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome are also the pathological results of severe and critical ncp patients suffering from cytokine storm which are the main death cause for patient 12 13 previous studies have confirmed that intestinal microenvironmental disorders and imbalance of intestinal flora can cause the occurrence and development of respiratory diseases through the gut-lung axis therefore lung diseases can be treated by adjusting intestinal microbiota 14 15 in the theoretical system of tcm there is a doctrine of lung and large intestine in pair  some scholars have suggested that tcm pathogenesis of ncp is related to the lung-spleen-large intestine dysfunction 10 16 17 it has been discovered that houttuynia cordata polysaccharide hcp a chinese herbal medicine extract from houttuynia cordata thunb can keep the intestinal homeostasis in h1n1 virus-infected mice and protect the intestinal wall barrier inhibit il-1 production mediated by toll receptors and improve the expression of il-10 suggesting that the effect of anti-inflammatory damage is related to regulation of intestinal microbiota as a main active ingredient of scutellaria baicalensis georgi and coptis chinensis franch berberines bioavailability and in vivo metabolism are found to have close relationship with intestinal organic acids and microbiota 18 19 the doctrine of lung and large intestine in pair in tcm theory is similar to the gut-lung axis in the theory of modern medicine the most frequently used cms for ncp patients in our study also suggests channel tropism  of numerous cms belongs to lung spleen stomach and intestine therefore cms can achieve the purpose of relieving and curing lung diseases by adjusting the intestinal microenvironment balance moreover it is not only one of the mechanisms of chinese medicine treatment for ncp but also one important approach to screen novel chinese medicines for treating ncp in the future the network pharmacology results in this study indicated that the recommended formulas in five disease stages have both generality and individuality in the compound level in which compound quercetin luteolin kaempferol acacetin etc all are involved in the treatment of multi-stages of the disease the target and kegg pathway enrichment results also show the certain integrity and the different tendency of formulas meanwhile by comparing the qfpdd with the recommended formula of the first four stages 20 21 we discover that the qfpdd has a certain integrity on the compound level however on the target level the qfpdd has covered most of the predicted target of the recommended formula of the first four disease stages and the mutual target from both two sources have a higher network parameter the kegg pathways enrichment results about qfpdd are consist with the effects of recommended formulas of mild and moderate stages as well all these results confirmed the consistency of qfpdd with the recommended formulas of the first four disease stages from the perspective of network pharmacology in summary this study suggests tcm has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution of ncp covid-19 and the symptom positive correlation between fever and abnormal digestion indicates that researchers should pay more attention on intestinal functional recovery and microenvironmental balance in the treatment of ncp additionally the network pharmacology results demonstrate the appropriateness of theatrical formulas for qfpdd and other recommended formulas in guideline for the compounds corresponding to targets can cover various stages of the disease as there has been no effective targeted drugs for ncp up to now the early intervention to ncp is important in controlling the spread of covid-19 according to the protocol for prevention and control of covid-19 edition 6 by chinese center for disease control and prevention the use of tcm in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases was encouraged and supported and tcm was applied in the whole process of disease 7 22 numerous data have showed that the early intervention of tcm and modern medicine have positive effects on shortening time of hospitalization and ameliorating symptoms reducing the development of mild and moderate case to severe case and the mortality rate improving the cure rate and the rehabilitation of the recovery population of ncp patients 23 a report from hunan province suggested that due to the increasing the use of tcm for ncp the patients average hospitalization day was shortened for 2 days and none of the patients turned to critical stage 15 a study about 34 ncp patients mostly moderate type from wuhan found satisfied efficacy of integrated use of cm and western medicine on protecting heart liver kidney and other organ functions as well as reducing inflammatory response and improving immune function through the observation of patients treated with conventional western medicine cm decoctions traditional chinese patent medicines and cm injections 24 25 in a study on 6 cases of severe and critical ncp the results showed that qufeidu no1 formulae  combined with conventional western medicine treatment as well as integrating xuebijing injection  andor lianhua qingwen capsule  significantly improved pathological evolution of critical patients consequently all of patients recovered 26 27 however there were still deficiencies of the clinical research evidence on the integration of traditional chinese and western medicine treatment for ncp mainly embodying small sample size the absence of control group and the diversification of treatment programs therefore constantly expanding the sample size and employing standardized randomized controlled trial rct design will give more convincing scientific evidence to demonstrate the superiority of tcm for ncp treatment at present ncp has been nearly controlled in china by the end of april 1st 2020 up to 9244 of ncp patients have recovered in china on march 23 the state council information office of china reported that 74187 confirmed covid-19 patients 915 of total confirmed cases accepted the combined treatment with tcm and modern medicine and the clinical efficacy observations showed that the total effective rate reached more than 90 28 as tong xiaolin said practice proved the importance of sticking to both tcm and modern approaches and chinese medicine had the unique advantage in establishing a collaboration mechanism between them 29 in summary tcm had a definite effect on mild and moderate ncp mainly manifested in relieving symptoms and shortening the time of virus nucleic acid turning negative fig 5 moreover tcm not only played a role in controlling the progression of disease in the early stage but also comforted patients psychologically 30 in addition tcm reduced the proportion of mild to severe cases which could contribute to save medical resources from the perspective of public health the utilization of tcm has implications for the development of medicines in the future as the ncp virus has some mutations when compared to sars or mers coronavirus the natural compounds effectiveness against the two previous coronaviruses might not be present in the new virus which urges updated tcm formulas in this study the anti-ncp effects of the natural compounds have been mainly confirmed by the screening method and the treatment effect of dampness pathogen results in the shortening of hospital stay for patients of mild type thus tcm treatment was not only effective for the ncp patients but also advantageous to the clinical development of medicines to dampness pathogen and lung infection diseases which have high incidence rate of respiratory system syndrome therefore chinese medicine treatment has positive impact on infectious lung diseases as well as the development of new medicines traditional chinese medicine has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution of novel coronavirus pneumonia and plays a positive role in ncp treatment according to the clinical data from wuhan in this study multiple linear regression analysis shows that the tcm category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness improved patients recovery suggesting the vitalness of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in the tcm treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia the network pharmacology results demonstrate active compounds from qfpdd and recommended formulas by national health commission contribute to recovery of different disease progresses during tcm treating novel coronavirus pneumonia chinese medicine treatment is advantageous in treating ncp as well as the development of new medicines for infectious lung diseases

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has progressed to a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality the who and the united states center for disease control and prevention cdc have issued interim clinical guidance for management of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease  but there is limited data on the virologic and clinical characteristics for prognosis of severe covid-19 a total of 50 patients with severe covid-19 were divided into good and poor recovery groups the dynamic viral shedding and serological characteristics of sars-cov-2 were explored the risk factors associated with poor recovery and lung lesion resolutions were identified in addition the potential relationships among the viral shedding the pro-inflammatory response and lung lesion evolutions were characterized a total of 58 of the patients had poor recovery and were more likely to have a prolonged interval of viral shedding the longest viral shedding was 57 days after symptom onset older age hyperlipemia hypoproteinemia corticosteroid therapy consolidation on chest computed-tomography ct and prolonged sars-cov-2 igm positive were all associated with poor recovery additionally the odds of impaired lung lesion resolutions were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia hyperlipemia and elevated levels of il-4 and ferritin finally viral shedding and proinflammatory responses were closely correlated with lung lesion evolutions on chest ct  medrxiv preprint patients with severe covid-19 have prolonged sars-cov-2 infection and delayed intermittent viral shedding older age hyperlipemia hypoproteinemia corticosteroid usage and prolonged sars-cov-2 igm positive might be utilized as predicative factors for the patients with poor recovery  recovered

severe cases of covid-19 in wuhan china were focused on and the virologic and clinical characteristics of sars-cov-2 were investigated to uncover the natural history of sars-cov-2 a single-center observational study was performed at union hospital within the tongji medical college of huazhong university of science and technology hust all of the studied adult patients with covid-19 infection were hospitalized on february 9 2020 forty-eight patients were classified as laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 diagnosis based on positive viral nucleic-acid test results from throatswab samples whereas the remaining two patients were clinically diagnosed cases viral nucleic-acid test was negative but diagnosis was made based on symptoms exposure history and the presence of lung-imaging features consistent with coronavirus pneumonia 11 12  both of the two clinically diagnosed patients were later confirmed using serologic tests for sars-cov-2 the medical records from february 9 to march 17 2020 of the severely ill patients were analyzed all of the patients were divided into either a good or poor recovery group according to their clinical outcome on march 17 2020 in addition the patients were also divided into lung lesions with a partial resolution-patient group and a lung lesions with significant resolution-patient group based on the latest chest ct scans from march 11 to march 17 2020  this study was approved by the ethics commission of union hospital at tongji medical college of hust written informed consent was obtained directly from patient the details of the data

the counts and percentages in each category a pearsons 2 test a pearsons 2 test with continuity correction or a fishers exact test were utilized as appropriate to compare the differences between covid-19 patients with good recovery and poor recovery all of the analyses were performed using the r statistical package version 353 fifty patients with covid-19 were enrolled in this study on february 9 2020 a total of 27 were male and 23 were female the median age was 64 years iqr 37-87 years more than half of patients had underlying disorders including hypertension 10 20 diabetes 12 24 coronary heart disease 11 22 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 3 6  among other disorders most patients experienced symptoms such as fatigue 39 78 fever 28 56 and cough 24 48 all of the patients had shortness of breath upon admission table 1  most patients exhibited lymphopenia upon admission the common complications while in the hospital were electrolyte disorders coagulopathy dyslipidemia hypoproteinemia and liver dysfunction importantly hyperlipidemia hypoproteinemia and liver injury were more frequently observed in patients with poor recovery with tg and lactatdehydrogenase ldh levels above the normal range in addition coagulation disorders were commonly seen in patients with poor recovery and the frequency of fibrogen fib elevation differed greatly between the two groups table 2  additionally patients with poor recovery had a higher frequency of corticosteroid therapy and albumin administration than patients with good recovery  table 2  odds of poor recovery were higher in patients with older age hypoproteinemia hyperlipemia and corticosteroid therapy  table 2  as of march 17 2020 the median time from admission to discharge was 365 days iqr 24-38 days a total of 21 42 patients had been discharged whereas 29 58 patients were still hospitalized with multifocal lesions on chest ct a total of 363 viral nucleic-acids tests were performed to explore the viral shedding during the disease course the viral detection positive rates differed between different specimen types and varied with day after onset of disease supplementary table 2  the dynamic pattern of viral shedding showed that most patients had intermittent virus shedding intriguingly two patients had significant clinical improvement but their viral nucleic-acid tests remained positive for a few days as of march 17 2020 the median duration of viral shedding was 31 days iqr 27-34 days after symptom onset and the longest duration of viral shedding was 57 days  figure 1a  the interval between first and last positive pcr assay results 4 to 22 days was extensively prolonged in patients with poor recovery in addition the serologic tests for sars-cov-2 also differed greatly between the two groups the presence of prolonged sars-cov-2 igm was closely associated with the poor recovery of patients with covid-19 p003 table2 a total of 11 out of 12 9166 patients with good recovery have positive igg but negative igm after hospitalization for one month in contrast 15 517 1529 patients with poor recovery had positive test results for both igm and igg as of march 17 2020 the longest duration of igm was 55 days at onset of illness indicating that severe patients with poor recovery were more likely to have a prolonged acute phase of the illness  figure 1b  a total of 195 chest ct imaging results were collected to continuously monitor the disease courses the most common patterns seen on the initial chest ct scans were bilateral lung involvement 49 out of 50 98 ground-glass opacities ggo 49 out of 50 98 and consolidation 21 out of 50 42 table 1 and supplementary figure   1a  importantly patients with poor recovery were more likely to have persistent lung damage with diffuse patterns of ggo and multifocal consolidation and the consolidation pattern was closely associated with the poor outcomes of the patients p003 table 2  the lesions were gradually absorbed with residual ggo consolidation interstitial abnormalities and lung fibrosis observed supplementary figure 3  most patients in the good recovery group had significant improvement on the chest ct prior to hospital discharge in contrast lung lesion resolution was extensively delayed in patients with poor recovery next several stages were defined to explore the pattern of lung lesion evolution these included the severest stage partial resolution significant resolution and complete resolution the most common pattern of evolution was the initial progression to the severest stage followed by partial resolution and significant resolution as expected the duration of the severest stage and lung lesion resolution was markedly extended in patients with impaired lung lesion resolution supplementary figure 1b  in addition the odds of impaired lung lesion resolution were higher in patients with hypoproteinemia and hyperlipemia in particular liver all rights reserved no

to explore the inflammatory-response prolife in severe-condition covid-19 patients the laboratory data of inflammatory response-related biomarkers during hospitalization were examined it was found that most of the patients had ferritin crp esr il-2 il-4 and il-6 levels above the normal ranges table 1  in contrast the tnf- and ifn- levels were within the normal range in all of the patients intriguingly higher levels of crp il-4 esr ferritin and hs-crp were more often seen in patients with poor recovery table 2  and the dynamic inflammatory-response prolife was closely associated with the evolution of lung lesions on the chest ct indeed patients with impaired lung lesion resolution were more likely to have an active inflammatory response indicated by higher levels of ferritin and il-4 in the serum table 3  next to explore the potential role of the inflammatory response in the viral clearance and lung lesion resolution the clinical details of a patient with the longest duration of viral shedding were examined in this patient his viral shedding occurred on day 35 and persistent viral shedding could be observed on days 45-51 indicating active virus replication meanwhile an excess production of cytokine il-6 was observed on day 36 with rapid progression to the peak stage on day 47 importantly extensive lung damage was observed on the chest ct on day 35 but lesions were steadily resolved on days 41-48 with significant improvement on day 56  figure 2  a similar pattern could also be observed in other patients  supplementary figures 4 and 5  thus days of viral shedding and il-6 concentrations were significantly correlated with the lung lesion evolution on the chest ct in severe covid-19 patients it also suggested that patients with poor recovery were more likely to have a prolonged active phase of viral all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright

resolution and potential viral clearance although the lethality of covid-19 is lower than sars-cov approximately 10 and mers-cov approximately 34 covid-19 rapidly spreads resulting in a worldwide pandemic 14  the scope and development of the pandemic are much more severe than sars and mers compared with the viral shedding at 6-12 days after symptom onset of sars the covid-19 viral shedding is variable and even longer 15  moreover the nucleic-acids of sars-cov-2 have been continuously reported to still be detectable in patients who had been discharged after clinical recovery however this was not the case for the sars and mers nucleic-acids therefore a retrospective single-center observational study was performed to provide the clinical evidence to determine the virologic characteristics of sars-cov-2 it was found that clinical recovery of patients typically occurred with viral clearing in patients with good recovery however it was also found that viral shedding could persist for an interval of few days despite clinical improvements although zhou et al reported out that the median duration of viral shedding was 200 days iqr 17-24 days in survivors of covid-19 16  the duration of viral shedding was found to be greatly extended in this present study with a median duration of 31 days after symptom onset iqr 27-34 days this difference might be due to specimen collection disease severity immunological response corticosteroid usage antiviral treatments and the duration of the observational window in these various populations a 37-day observational study was conducted and patient samples were consecutively collected from both the upper respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal tract to improve the detection of sars-cov-2 during the course of the disease

addition it was found that the interval of viral shedding in patients with poor recovery was markedly prolonged importantly both the igm and igg of sars-cov-2 in the patients with poor recovery remained positive during the late stage of the disease this indicated that these patients might have active viral replication in the upper airway and that persistent viral shedding might be directly linked to the poor recovery of patients with covid-19 supporting this notion it was found that the sars-cov-2 rna could persist until death in non-survivors 17  based on the delayed interval of viral shedding pattern and the serologic features of sars-cov-2 it is proposed that severe-condition patients with covid-19 may need at least three negative pcr results with an interval of a few days in addition dynamic detection to improve the presence of igm-negative should also be evaluated to guide discharge planning for covid-19 patients similar to sars and mers the cytokine profile is closely associated with the severity of covid-19 indeed in this prognostic analysis it was found that an active inflammatory response was more likely to be triggered in patients with poor recovery marked by higher concentrations of crp esr ferritin and hs-crp suggesting that these patients might have a pro-inflammatory factor storm previously huang et al reported that the sars-cov-2 infection could initiate increased secretion of thelper-2 th2 cytokines eg il4 and il10 that suppress inflammation 18  in this study it was also found that severe patients with poor recovery had higher levels of il-4 compared to patients with good recovery since the il-4 levels were slightly elevated in these patients it was speculated that this might be due to the antagonistic effects of il-4 during the active phase of the pro-inflammatory response importantly it was found that the wave of the cytokine storm typically occurred during the active phase of viral infection and a prolonged inflammatory response could be observed in severe patients with poor recovery consequently excessive inflammation damages lung tissue and subsequent lung repair and regeneration could be initiated in this all rights

severe patients to control the high amounts of cytokines however it was found that corticosteroid therapy was closely associated with the poor recovery of severely infected patients therefore corticosteroids should be administrated with great caution if necessary in addition to the viral shedding other risk factors for slower recovery in severe covid-19 patients were also identified consistent with previous studies 19 20  it was confirmed that older age hypoproteinemia and increased levels of ldh were associated with the poor clinical outcome of covid-19 patients in particular older age hyperlipemia hypoproteinemia corticosteroid therapy and increased levels of fib and tg were associated with the poor recovery of covid-19 patients up-todate information regarding the risk factors associated with lung lesion resolution in severe-condition covid-19 patients is scarce the clinical data in this study suggested that all of the patients had lung lesions on chest ct and the consolidation pattern on chest ct was closely associated with poor recovery intriguingly prognostic factors including hyperlipemia and hypoproteinemia were also closely linked to the odds of impaired

the number of reported cases for the number of deaths that is more likely to be closer to the real number furthermore by 50 calibrating the parameters of the sird model to fit the reported data we also provide 51 tentative forecasts until the 29th of february 52 the basic reproduction number r 0  is one of the key values that can predict 53 whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or die out r 0 represents 54 the average number of secondary cases that result from the introduction of a single 55 infectious case in a totally susceptible population during the infectiousness period 56 based on the reported data of confirmed cases we provide estimations of the r 0 from 57 the 16th up to the 20th of january in order to satisfy as much as possible the 58 hypothesis of s  n that is a necessary condition for the computation of r 0  59 we also provide estimations of the case fatality  and case recovery hat ratios 60 over the entire period using a rolling window of one day from the 11th of january to the 61 16th of january to provide the very first estimations 62 furthermore we calibrated the parameters of the sird model to fit the reported 63 data we first provide a coarse estimation of the recovery  and mortality rates  of 64 the sird model using the first period of the outbreak then an estimation of the 65 infection rate is accomplished by wrapping around the sird simulator an 66 optimization algorithm to fit the reported data from the 11th of january to the 10th of 67 february we have start our simulations with one infected person on the 16th of 68 november which has been suggested as a starting date of the epidemic run the sir 69 model until the 10th of february  below we describe analytically our approach 70 let us start by denoting with st it rt dt the number of susceptible 71 infected recovered and dead persons respectively at time t in the population of size n  72 for our analysis we assume that the total number of the population remains constant 73 based on the demographic data for the province of hubei n  59m thus the discrete 74 sird model reads the above system is defined in discrete time points t  1 2    with the 76 corresponding initial condition at the very start of the epidemic s0  n  1 77 i0  1 r0  d0  0 here  and  denote the effectiveapparent the per day 78 recovery and fatality rates note that these parameters do not correspond to the actual 79 per day recovery and mortality rates as the new cases of recovered and deaths come 80 from infected cases several days back in time however one can attempt to provide 81 some coarse estimations of the effectiveapparent values of these epidemiological 82 parameters based on the reported confirmed cases using an assumption and approach 83 described in the next section parameters of the sird model as march 5 2020 328 lets us denote with it  it  it  1  where x  i r d let us also denote by xt the t  1 column vector containing all the reported new 96 cases up to time t let us also denote by 97 cxt  cx1 cx2     cxt t  the t  1 column vector containing the 98 corresponding cumulative numbers up to time t on the basis of eqs2 3 4 one 99 can provide a coarse estimation of the parameters r 0   and  as follows starting with the estimation of r 0  we note that as the province of hubei has a 101 population of 59m one can reasonably assume that for any practical means at least at 102 the beginning of the outbreak s  n  by making this assumption one can then 103 provide an approximation of the expected value of r 0 using eq5 and eq2 eq3 104 eq4 in particular substituting in eq2 the terms it  1 and 3 and dt  dt  dt  1 from eq4 and 106 bringing them into the left-hand side of eq2 we get adding eq3 and eq4 we get finally assuming that for any practical means at the beginning of the spread that 109 st  1  n and dividing eq7 by eq8 we get note that one can use directly eq9 to compute r 0 with regression without the 111 need to compute first the other parameters ie   and  at this point the regression can be done either by using the differences per se or by 113 using the corresponding cumulative functions instead of the differences for the 114 calculation of r 0 using eq9 indeed it is easy to prove that by summing up both 115 sides of eq7 and eq8 over time and then dividing them we get the following 116 equivalent expression for the calculation of r 0  here we used eq 10 to estimate r 0 in order to reduce the noise included in the 118 differences note that the above expression is a valid approximation only at the 119 beginning of the spread of the disease thus based on the above a coarse estimation of r 0 and its corresponding 121 confidence intervals can be provided by solving a linear regression problem

the corresponding time delays 154 having estimated the above effective approximate values of the parameters  and  155 an approximation of the effective infected rate  that is not biased by the 156 assumption of s  n can be obtained by using the sird simulator in particular in 157 the sird model the values of the  and  parameters were set equal to the ones found 158 using the reported data solving the corresponding least squares problems given by 159 eq14 15  as initial conditions we have set one infected person on the 16th of 160 november and run the simulator until the last date for which there are available data 161 here up to the 10th of february then the optimal value of the infection rate  that 162 fits the reported data was found by wrapping around the sird simulator an 163 optimization algorithm such as a nonlinear least-squares solver to solve the problem 164 where where cx sird t x  i r d are the cumulative cases resulting from the 165 sird simulator at time t w 1  w 2  w 3 correspond to scalars serving in the general case as 166 weights to the relevant functions for the solution of the above optimization problem we 167 used the function lsqnonlin of matlab 20 using the levenberg-marquard algorithm 168 as discussed we have derived results using two different scenarios see in methodology 170 for each scenario we first present the results for the basic reproduction number as well 171 as the case fatality and case recovery ratios as obtained by solving the least squares 172 problem using a rolling window of an one-day step for their computation we used the 173 first six days ie from the 11th up to the 16th of january to provide the very first 174 estimations we then proceeded with the calculations by adding one day in the rolling 175 window as described in the methodology until the 10th of february we also report the 176 corresponding 90 confidence intervals instead of the more standard 95 because of the 177 small size of the data for each window we also report the corresponding coefficients of 178 determination r 2  representing the proportion of the variance in the dependent 179 variable that is predictable from the independent variables and the root mean square of 180 error rmse the estimation of r 0 was based on the data until january 20 in order 181 to satisfy as much as possible the hypothesis underlying its calculation by eq9 then as described above we provide coarse estimations of the effective per day 183 recovery and mortality rates of the sird model based on the reported data by solving 184 the corresponding least squares problems then an estimation of the infection rate  185 was obtained by wrapping around the sird simulator an optimization algorithm as 186 described in the previous section finally we

have taken the interval 0008 and 0012 and for  215 we have taken the interval between 005 0076 corresponding to recovery periods from 216 13 to 20 days as described in the methodology we have also used the sird simulator 217 to provide an estimation of the effective infection rate  by optimization with w 1 1 218 w 2 2 w 3 2 thus we performed the simulations by setting 0063 and 001 and 219 as initial conditions one infected zero recovered and zero deaths on november 16th 220 2019 and run until the 10th of february the optimal with respect to the reported 221 confirmed cases from the 11th of january to the 10th of february value of the infected 222 rate  was  0193 90 ci 0191-0195 this corresponds to a mean value of the 223 basic reproduction numberr 0  26 note that this value is different compared to the 224 value that was estimated using solely the reported data however as more data are released it appears that the mortality rate is lower than 239 the predicted with the current data and thus the death toll is expected to be 240 significantly less compared with the predictions at least compared to the expected and 241 upper bounds  it is interesting to note that the above estimation of r 0 is close enough to the one 262 reported in other studies see in the introduction for a review and should be attributed to the small size of the data and data uncertainty this is 267 also reflected in the corresponding confidence intervals as more data are taken into 268 account this variation is significantly reduced thususing all the scaled data from the 269 11th of january until the 10th of february the estimated value of the case fatality ratio 270  now drops to  0163 90 ci 0016-00167 while that of the case recovery 271 ratio is  011 90 ci 0099-012 it is interesting also to note that as the available 272 data become more the estimated case recovery ratio increases slightly see fig 10  273 while the case fatality ratio seems to be stabilized at a rate of  0163 interval of recovery periods from 6 to 8 days again we used the sird simulator to provide estimation of the infection rate by 285 optimization setting w 1  1 w 2  400 w 3  1 to balance the residuals of deaths with 286 the scaled numbers of the infected and recovered cases thus to find the optimal 287 infection run we used the sird simulations with   015d 1  and   00005 and as 288

approaches a plateau  by the time of the acceptance of our paper according to the official data released on 319 the 29th of february the cumulative number confirmed infected cases in hubei was 320 67000 that of recovered was 31300 and the death toll was 2800 these numbers 321 are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of 322 february that are based on scenario i in scenario ii by assuming a 20-fold scaling of 323 the confirmed cases of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the confirmed number 324 of the recovered cases in the total population forecasts show a significant decline of 325 outbreak in hubei by 29th of february this fact has been lately reported based on 326 this scenario the casefatality rate in the total population is of the order of 015 at 327 this point we should note that our sird modelling approach did not take into account 328 many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the 329 effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics the heterogeneous contact 330 transmission network the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic 331 the characteristics of the population eg the effect of the age people who had already 332 health problems also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an 333 assumption considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and 334 reported of note covid-19 which is thought to be principally transmitted from 335 person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of 336 the fecal-oral route 21 had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before 337 the imposed lockdown and quarantine of wuhan on january 23 having thus infected 338 unknown numbers of people the number of asymptomatic and mild cases with 339 subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may 340 be substantial these cases which possibly represent the bulk of the covid-19 341 infections remain unrecognized especially during the influenza season 22  this highly 342 likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases 343 inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context 344 distorting epidemiologic reality another important factor that should be taken into 345 consideration pertains to the diagnostic criteria used to determine infection status and 346 confirm cases a positive pcr test was required to be considered a confirmed case

contain the spreading of the corona virus has been undertaken on the tacit assumption that these measures will be temporary and can be loosened when the covid-19 infection rates decrease and discontinued altogether once vaccines are available mitigating climate change and achieving ambitious temperature targets as set out in the paris agreement requires a long-term structural change taking us away from our current carbon-intensive economy to a zero-carbon and then net-negative carbon economy as current research holds out little hope that a perfect vaccine in the form of solar climate engineering will be available in the future the measures and efforts required must translate into a permanent ongoing form of commitment while progressive climate change and the spread of the coronavirus operate on very different time scales impatience about the duration of corona lockdown has indicated once more a fundamental problem for long-term environmental concerns clearly the economic and social costs associated with the emergence of the virus and the shutdown are significant helm 2020 oecd 2020 but any serious costbenefit analysis would need to take into account not only the fact that different degrees of lockdown are available but also that the overall cost is affected by the expectations of agents regarding possible future re-lockdowns due to insufficient containment of the virus seen thus it is anything but clear at which point in time the actual cost of lockdown would have exceeded the economic cost of the virus spreading in an unmitigated or insufficiently mitigated way during the course of lock-down measures voices calling for a green recovery stimulus package centering around low-carbon investments in the aftermath of the corona crisis have make themselves heard by contrast advocates of postponing climate mitigation-related taxes levies and regulations have also entered the fray claiming that timely recovery should not be jeopardized by any additional economic burdens the debate on the relation between economic recovery and climate policies has been conducted from three major perspectives the first of these is largely notable for general statements of intent recommending that the recovery should be green and sustainable that eu climate targets should be supported and that other environmental targets maintaining biodiversity etc need to be taken into account when designing recovery measures such well-meant counsels as the statement issued by the german national academy of sciences leopoldina 2020 are useful in reminding us that recovery from the corona crisis should not come at the expense of neglecting other objectives and that climate policy should not be back-burnered as was the case after the financial crisis in 2009 otherwise they are of little practical value the second approach has involved rather detailed proposals calling either for a greening of recovery by foregrounding measures to support renewable energies public transport energy efficiency etc or for a blackening of recovery by postponing andor abandoning climate measures and environmental regulations predominantly these proposals are representing the positions of the various interest groups involved for example representatives of the aviation industry try to prevent the harmonization of carbon prices on fuels with respect to kerosene and argue against the introduction of kerosene taxes this idea resurfaces in the discussion on recovery measures by say the austrian aviation association 2020 on the other hand in its comprehensive list of recovery demands the ngo german environment action 2020 urges for example for the abandonment of blue hydrogen projects though not explaining why this is likely to stimulate economic recovery various other interest groups are in favor of postponing suspending or even abandoning existing environmental and climate regulations for example janusz kowlaski the polish deputy minister of state assets urges that the ets european emissions trading scheme should be removed from january 1 2021 or at least poland should be excluded from the system1 clearly there is no point in discussing nonsensical ideas of this kind but some of these proposals also make sensible suggestions like adjusting the german cap on renewable energy installations or abandoning the eu average fleet-consumption regulation because the former contradicts german renewable-energy targets and the latter is an inefficient instrument for regulating vehicle emissions however these suggestions do nothing to provide stimulus for a quick recovery while specific processes and regulation timelines for regulations may need to be adjusted in the context of the corona crisis sensible measures of this kind should be discussed and decided upon in the regular political process confining potential stimulus and recovery measures to their proper purpose does not mean imposing a ban on meaningful climate or environmental policies that are not associated with the corona crisis the third and most sensible perspective replaces specific proposals with sustainability assessment guidelines like those suggested by the world bank 2020 while hardly any possible recovery measure would perform well against the comprehensive list of criteria provided by the world bank such guidelines are helpful in arguing against interest group driven proposals the world bank has suggested that potential measures up for consideration as part of a recovery strategy need to be assessed against both short- and long-term criteria an example for the former being the expected economic multiplier associated with certain measures bayer et al 2020 suggest that income transfers as planned under the us cares package perform well against this specific short-term criteria they could help to stabilize private-sector spending and the multiplier could increase to 2 in the case of transfers being conditionalbut not related to emissions but to the propensity to consume ie conditional on being unemployed however private-sector spending like this should not imply any unintended adverse effects on essential long-term structural change that might arise from such things as temporarily adjusted risk preferences once postponed or stimulated demand and investment take place during the recovery process carbon-price signals are vital in providing technology-neutral incentives for low-co2 purchasing and production decisions overloading stimulus or recovery packages with too many emission-related conditions performs poorly against the short-term criteria with respect to a timely recovery even worse the inclusion in recovery packages of various detailed suggestions from the various interest groups usually results in a non-transparent rent-seeking and political bargaining process in which it remains unclear whether sensible individual emission-related decisions are being prioritized at the expense of a more challenging long-term climate policy accordingly accounting for the long-term criteria requires that existing or planned climate policies providing incentives for emission reductions and technological innovation should remain in place and not be postponed let alone weakened otherwise uncertain short-term recovery impulses most likely come at the cost of less efficient emission-reduction paths in the long term  potential use of hydroxychloroquine ivermectin and azithromycin drugs in fighting covid-19 trends scope and relevance r choudhary ak sharma   covid-19 infection has become pandemic after its first outbreak in wuhan china in 2019 this infection is caused by novel sars-cov-2 virus which is distinct from its related type sars-cov the world health organization who has termed this disease as covid-19 coronavirus disease-2019 upto 09thapril 2020 1496055 cases have been confirmed globally with 89435 deaths while 336780 people got recovered across the world the most number of infected cases were from united states 432438 confirmed cases 14808 deaths and 24125 recovery of the patients followed by spain 152446 confirmed cases 15238 deaths and

 latter being the first epicentre of this disease this data suggests that infection due to covid-19 is spreading exponentially in new hotspots as compared to the first epicentre wuhan where new cases are in constant decline 1 at this point of time there is an urgent need of therapeutic strategy in order to control the spread of covid-19 as a disease numerous researchers across the world are working on finding the cure and chemoprophylaxis of this disease with many of them are even putting their efforts to develop the vaccine recently some of the reports on hydroxychloroquine 2 3 4 ivermectin 5 and azithromycin 6 have shown therapeutic effects against novel coronavirus infection however it was not reported that which drug has better efficacy in comparison to other or a combination of them can give life saving results therefore the present report has been able to provide the comprehensive view of combining the knowledge of these drugs altogether in the context of current health emergency around the world the first category of drug was chloroquine and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine which may act as a therapeutic agent against covid-19 infection earlier both have been used widely for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus chloroquine was initially used for the treatment of malaria but plasmodium falciparum substantially developed resistance against it with the subsequent development of new antimalarials this drug is now being used for the prophylaxis of malaria in 1946 by the introduction of hydroxyl group into chloroquine a derivative was produced known as hydroxychloroquine and was found to have less acute poisoning than the former one 7 both the drugs otherwise share a similar mechanism of action and structure these drugs tend to increase the ph within intracellular vacuoles and act as weak base in addition they are known to alter processes such as protein degradation by acidic hydrolases in the lysosome assembly of macromolecules in the endosomes and post translation modification of proteins in the golgi apparatus 8 over the past few decades this drug has received wider attention as a potential antiviral drug chang and his colleagues in 2014 revealed that hydroxychloroquine activates the host anti-viral innate immunity 9 this drug accumulates in the cellular organelles creating acidic environment to inhibit the replication of different viruses by interfering with endosomelysosome trafficking or viral protein maturation during virions maturation fig 2
 during the recent pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 hydroxychloroquine was found to act as a potential drug in fighting against covid-19 some of the in vitro and poorly controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials revealed that this drug has activity against severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sarscov-2 2 3 4 in china clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine are further in-progress for the treatment and management of covid-19 disease nct04261517 and nct04307693 another study revealed that ivermectin which is a broad spectrum anti-parasitic drug demonstrated its efficacy against covid-19 which comes as a second line of drug 5 ivermectin is fda approved drug known to have wide-spectrum antiviral activity against number of viruses under in vitro conditions 10 11 12 13 sars-cov-2 causative agent of covid-19 is a single stranded rna virus positive sense which is closely related to sars coronavirus sars-cov recent study on ivermectin against sars-cov-2 under in vitro conditions revealed that it can inhibit the viral replication the single treatment of this drug was able to reduce the virus up to 5000-fold in culture within 48h however no further reduction was reported with further increase in time period ie up to 72h moreover no toxicity was seen with the drug at any point of time 5 mechanism by which ivermectin responded against the cov-19 virus is not known and was believed to be working similarly as it acted on other viruses it was known to inhibit the nuclear import of viral and host proteins integrase protein of viruses and the importin imp 1 heterodimer was responsible for in nuclear import which further increases the infection fig 2 as most of the rna viruses are dependent upon imp1 during infection ivermectin acts on it and inhibits the import with the increase in antiviral response 5 14 third category of therapeutic drug is azithromycin which is a class of antibiotics known as macrolide used to treat infections like bronchitis pneumonia and mac mycobacterium avium complex infection with the spread of the sars-cov-2 viral pneumonia which started in wuhan china many countries of the world started developing countermeasures in order to decrease the spread of the disease researchers found that apart from hydroxychloroquine another fda approved drug known as azithromycin was shown to have therapeutic effects against covid-19 in a study done by a research group at new mexico university the researchers were able to prove that azithromycin acted as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base which modulate the ph of endosomes and trans-golgi network fig 2 this further led to in vitro effects on intracellular organelles similar to the one as conferred by hydroxychloroquine 6 this further indicates that this antimicrobial drug has an immense therapeutic value as far as the treatment of covid-19 patients is concerned clinical trials need to be carried out with this drug as it can act as a prophylaxis for declining the infection rate these drugs have been shown to have a potential broad-spectrum antiviral response in vitro against many viruses including coronaviruses however hydroxychloroquine has been found to be associated with dangerous side-effects in the past if the dosage is not carefully controlled there have been many cases of chloroquine poisoning reported in nigeria and the usa as well due to sudden rapid increase in demand of the above broad-spectrum drugs may lead to significant shortage for patients who rely on these drugs to treat their other disorders like malaria rheumatoid arthritis among others therefore adequate buffer stocks should be maintained for these drugs to overcome potential scarcity of the above-mentioned drugs all three categories of drugs seem to act against novel coronavirus infection however further research using large cohort of samples with randomized controlled clinical trials are urgently required for each drug alone and in-combination in order to find a concrete solution against covid-19 infection the author has no conflict of interest to declare  epidemiology of covid-19 pandemic recovery and mortality ratio around the globe aziz noor ullah farhana maqbool zulfiqar bhatti a asmat khan ullah   the source of origin of coronavirus is still a mystery however early investigations have reported its possible origin from the wuhan seafood wholesale market most of the early patient history associated with their movement to that seafood market whereas there were numerous other patients who have not gone to that market in those days that association indicated its human to human transmission in spreading the outbreak few environmental samples taken from the market have been reported positive but no specific animal was identified as its origin7 an initial investigation based on codon claimed snake as an origin8 it has also been proposed that 2019-ncov naturally propagates in bats9 previous study revealed that wet markets of southern china including wuhan and guangzhou cities have the greater risk of spreading novel corona viruses because of wild animal trading and the absence of biosecurity measures10 the other possibility is that bats and their excrements are commonly used in traditional chinese medicine which may also be a source of infection11 it is also possible that the virus had infected other mammal that was traded at the market and served as the source of the infection to people two already highly pathogenic coronaviruses were reported to be originated from the animals the transmission of the first highly pathogenic virus sars-cov occurred from animal to human in wet markets the source of sars-cov was bat which transferred this virus to human via civet cat as an intermediate host12 the bats were also reported to be the possible origin of mers-cov which is also a zoonotic virus13 however mers-cov was reported in the patients having frequent contact with the camels in the middle east dromedary camel was considered as traditional household animal to avoid contact with camel is not possible due to which they suffered from the periodic outbreak of mers-cov14 in this context the identification of source animals responsible for the transmission of covid-19 virus is extremely essential in order to control and prevent any future outbreak the possible transmission cycle of covid-19 is presented in fig1 covid-19 is a great public health and safety concern all across the globe and the chinese government international agencies and who is aware of the consequences of the outbreak the first case of covid-19 outside china was reported in thailand15 due to rise in infected and suspected cases of covid-19 in china by the end of the third week of january 2020 the chinese government had completely lockdown the wuhan city hubei province they partially lockdown other cities at higher risk to stop its further spreading since the public health emergency declared by who much more attention at national and international levels has been focused on covid-19 the concept of one health which means that the health of people is linked with the animal and connected environment has gained great importance in this current scenario1617 the super-spreaders infected person who travels and infect others are mostly responsible for large outbreaks for example traveling of one infected person with sars-cov from hong kong to toronto infected 128 people in a local health care facility where he visited for treatment the same situation was with mers-cov where a single patient from saudi arabia traveled to south korea infected 186 patients with mers-cov18 the epidemiological characteristics observed in the case of covid-19 varied to a great extent as compared to the sars-cov the 2019-ncov replicates efficiently in the upper respiratory tract but the onset of symptoms appears to be slow although the infected individual carries a huge number of virus still heshe can perform hisher normal activities which leads to the spread of this infection to other individuals whereas in the sars-cov patients the transmission of infection is not reported during the prodromal period and transmission occurs when the patient becomes severely ill7 various factors affect and determine the spread of disease in an outbreak including transmissibility and severity morbidity and mortality will rely on the combination of transmissibility and severity and a rapid person to person transmission occurred in this outbreak the epidemiologists estimated the ro the basic reproduction number to measure the transmissibility value would be 22 for covid-1919 the severity and the case-fatality rate could be underestimated because many infected people have not yet recovered and may deceased after the onset of the covid-19 outbreak the potential risk of vertical transmission was a question mark control and prevention of this novel emerging infection among pregnant women have become a primary concern regarding vertical transmissibility the latest study published in the lancet gives some insight into the clinical features during pregnancy and potential of vertical transmission covid-19 infection in pregnant women20 although the research manipulates only a small number of nine pregnant women with confirmed covid-2019 no evidence for intrauterine infection was reported in late pregnancy in these cases21 a sars-cov-2 genomic study suggested that this virus has 88 genetic similarity with two sars-like coronaviruses isolated from a bat sbat-sl-covzc45 and bat- sl-covzxc21 while in case of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov bats genome similarities were 79 and 50 respectively homology studies have shown that sars-cov-2 has a similar receptor binding structure to that of sars-cov-1 so the ability of vertical transmission of corona-19 could be as low as that of sars-cov-122 although 2019-ncov has adverse effects on newborn including shortening of breathing premature birth and liver disorder but its vertical transmission has not proved23 the clinical findings of covid-19 infected pregnant women were same as non-pregnant women infected with covid-19 infection24 in accordance with sars-cov and mers cov this new virus was observed to affect more males than female individuals the reduced susceptibility of women can be explained by the fact that the sex hormone and x chromosome play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity moreover almost half of the population infected by covid-19 has underlying problems mainly diabetes cerebrovascular and cardiovascular problems similar to mers-cov the older people with the weak or compromised immune system are more susceptible to this disease 24 among the clinical signs fever dry cough dyspnea and fatigue were common in all cases upper respiratory tract infection ie rhinorrhea sneezing or sore throat were also uncommon in covid-19 the laboratory reports of covid-19 patients indicates lymphopenia decrease in white blood cells which suggested the destruction of lymphocyte and other immune cells by coronavirus leading to the weakening of cellular immune system25 some patients suffer from acute respiratory distress and septic shock which lead to the failure of multiple organs24-26 these cases are of crucial importance to be treated at earlier stages ct scan indicated ground-glass opacification and occasional consolidation in the patients27 most of the deaths have been reported in the patients who have the characteristic of warning signs described by the multi logistic binary search tree analysis mulbsta model these six signs which are included in the mulbsta model are multinodular infiltration lymphopenia bacterial co-infection smoking history hypertension and age28 few or no options are available for treating a viral disease that emerged suddenly no vaccine has been developed yet for the prevention of covid-19 infection26 a combination of antiviral drugs lopinavirritonavir pegylated interferon and ribavirin has been used in a mers-cov case reported in south korea that helped in the successful clearance of the virus29 another viral drug remdesivir has been reported to be effective against the viral infection in-vitro studies indicated that remdesivir has been successful in the termination of viral rna replication3032 and showed effectiveness against the mers-cov sars-cov and other bat originated coronaviruses3133 qamar et al 2020 screened the database of 32297 chinese medicinal plants for their antiviral activity they suggested 9 medicinal plants that might help in the prevention of viral replication34 further studies are necessary to figure out the effectiveness of these plants in this infection another study on virtual screening of a database of more than 3000 food and drug administration fda approved drugs was carried out in order to find the possible best available drug the results suggested that protein inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus hiv drugs might be helpful against the covid-1935 recently fda have authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine due to emergency situation without double blind and clinical trial for the treatment of covid-1936 since the discovery of the virus the covid-19 spread very rapidly all across the countries and cases have been reported in 210 countries around the globe till 1039 gmt on april 26 2020 the data obtained showed over 24 million confirmed cases of covid-1937 higher mortality rate 15 was found in algeria belgium 1395 italy and united kingdom 13 and netherland 1135 lower mortality rate was found in countries qatar 017 singapore 02 united arab emirate 06 and australia 097  the who keeps on updating and sharing these figures on daily basis and till april 28th it had iussued ninety seven reports giving countrywise details of number of cases higher mortality rate is related with the total number of infected cases as significant positive correlation r09 n56 was found between confirmed cases and deaths which showed that disease spread increases the risk of death due to overcrowded hospitals lower availability of medical facility and other environmental factors before mitigation measures were taken place covid-19 was already spread in the early stages38 countries showed early response suffered less than the countries that did not care in the early stage of this pandemic yet another reason of this pandemic was as 80 of covid-19 cases are mild or asymptomatic so the symptom base control of this disease is very difficult and less effective recovery versus deceased ratio was calculated and the data showed that recovery was 68 59 and 35 times higher than the death in singapore qatar and thailand respectively lower value of deceased over recovery ratio was found in united kingdom 003 netherland 008 ireland 016 and norway 02137 in contrast to covid-19 prevalence previous study shows that community acquired pneumonia cases were high in male who belonged to lower socio-economic group illiterate people living in rural areas39 patients recoveries are significantly correlated with the number of cases r  063 n  56 showed that recoveries are increasing with increase in number of cases the potential factors involved in the recovery might be strong immune system among the population good dietry habits and early treatment and bacillus calmette-gurin bcg vaccination policy in some country showed less cases than without bcg vaccinated nations 40 according to reuter the global death due to covid19 disease passed two hundred thousand on april 25th 2020 and it is expected that the total number of infected cases will cross three million people by the end of april 2020 more than 50 of these deaths have occurred in united states spain and italy the worst hit countries till april 25th united states had reported fifty two thousand four hundred deaths while italy spain and france have reported between 22000 and 26000 fatalities each of the top twenty most severely affected countires belgium has reported highest number of fatalities per capita with six deaths per ten thousand

antonietta mira kerrie mengersen  since the initial outbreak in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019  has rapidly spread to cause one of the most pressing challenges facing our world today the covid-19 pandemic within four months of the first reported cases more than two and a half million cases were confirmed with over two hundred thousand deaths globally and many countries had taken extreme measures to stop the spread in this work we analyse the response to the covid-19 outbreak for 103 countries over the period 22 january to 13 april 2020 we utilise a novel stochastic epidemiological model that includes a regulatory mechanism that captures the level of tolerance to rising confirmed cases within the response behaviour using approximate bayesian computation we identify that the top ten outbreaks as of 31 march are characterised by a high tolerance to rising cases tallies whereas countries that avoided severe outbreak have a low tolerance countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher identification rate as of 13 april almost all countries show declines in transmission rates and basic reproductive numbers furthermore countries approaching recovery also increased their identification rate between 31 march and 13 april we also demonstrate that uncertainty in undocumented infections dramatically impacts uncertainty in predictions overall we recommend that broader testing is required to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections  the world is at war with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 9  which was officially declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march 2020 42  from the earliest cases reported in december 2019 hubei china severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 spread rapidly throughout the world 37 45  on 3 april 2020 the global tally of confirmed cases exceeded one million with over 50000 fatalities 11 17  the challenge faced by healthcare systems worldwide cannot be understated 19 21 29 36  travel restrictions increased hygiene education social distancing school and business closures and even complete lockdowns 9 36 are now all-too-familiar concepts these are examples of non-pharmaceutical intervention npi strategies that many countries have introduced to slow transmission rates and relieve pressure on healthcare systems in the absence of a vaccine or treatment for covid-19 14  modelling and simulation are at the forefront of determining the efficacy of these measures in reducing sars-cov-2 transmission and quantifying risk of future outbreaks along with their potential severity 2 8 16 31  understanding of these effects is crucial given the potential deleterious sociological and economic impacts of many npis 3 4 5 9  the global modelling community has responded rapidly to the covid-19 situation and has provided insight into the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 25 26 32  global risk of spread through transport networks 17 44  forecasting and prediction 20 28 33  and evaluation of interventions 16  a variety of modelling strategies have been applied techniques include empirical approaches such as phenomenological growth curves 33  data-driven statistical approaches using non-linear autoregressive models 1  and mechanistic models based on epidemiological theory 22 with various extensions 7 34  here we consider a stochastic epidemiological model in which the true infected population is unobservable and a regulatory mechanism on the virus transmission process is included to capture the community response to a covid-19 outbreak there is a large body of literature related to modelling specific intervention strategies 16  we take a unique approach that does not explicitly model specific interventions instead our model captures a general tendency for the transmission rate to decline as the number of confirmed cases increases through the inclusion of a utility function the model also allows for more general responses incorporating deaths and recoveries to reflect alternative imperatives for intervention with this model we can identify key features differentiating countries that have experienced a severe outbreak from those that have managed to contain the spread within a bayesian framework we characterise 103 countries using covid-19 timeseries data provided by johns hopkins university 11 17  over two time periods 22 jan-31 mar 2020 and 22 jan-13 apr 2020 our characterisation is a broad assessment of the global response to the covid-19 pandemic and reflects how countries in early phases of outbreak may have adjusted their strategies to reduce the time to recovery in particular we find that very severe outbreaks are characterised by a high tolerance to rising confirmed case numbers before significant reductions in transmission rates occur of the top ten severely affected countries in terms of cumulative cases the only countries that observed a decrease in active cases during the period of study china and south korea are characterised by high identification rates the result of highly effective identification and quarantine programs we also find that for many countries the trans-mission rates in the later period of the study are declining however large unobserved infected population counts are also estimated our analysis shows that increased testing contact tracing isolation and quarantine measures are effective in reducing the severity of covid-19 outbreaks world-wide we also demonstrate that the unknown magnitude of undocumented cases substantively impacts uncertainty in predictions and we conclude that wider testing is also essential to reduce this uncertainty our model is a stochastic epidemiological model see materials and methods that describes the evolution of six sub-populations over time susceptible s t  undocumented infected i t  confirmed active a t  confirmed recovered r t  confirmed deceased d t  and undocumented recovered r u t  the cumulative confirmed cases can be recovered from the model as c t  a t  r t  d t  importantly the true values of s t  i t  and r u t are not observable in reality and are latent variables in our model this explicit treatment of an undocumented infected population is essential for more realistic uncertainty quantification a novel feature of our model is the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 that depends on a utility function of the observable states a t  r t  and d t  for the presented results this rate is a monotonically decreasing function in the cumulative confirmed cases c t  representing the overall population response to rising confirmed case numbers this effectively approximates the combined effect of npi introduction community compliance with various interventions and a general change in social behaviour as media outlets report higher case and fatality statistics however it is important to note that our framework allows for other utility functions that lead to other functional forms for the transmission rate see materials and methods and supplementary material our model has eight parameters to be estimated two transmission rates  0 and  where  can be regulated but  0 cannot ie residual unavoidable transmission case recovery rate  case identification rate  case death rate  relative latent recovery rate  regulatory parameter n and the initial infected scale factor  while details are provided in the materials and methods section the parameters n and  deserve some interpretation here the regulation parameter n controls the rate at which the transmission rate  is scaled down as the cumulative cases increase in general n  1 represents a response with a low tolerance to increasing cases 0  n  1 is a response with a higher tolerance for larger case numbers and n  0 indicates no regulatory effect at all see material and methods for more details throughout we refer to n  1 as a low tolerance response and n  1 as a high tolerance response importantly n does not provide information on the timescale in which the community responds nor the overall efficacy of interventions and management rather n is an indicator of how tolerant a community has been to growing case numbers the parameter  estimates the number of undocumented infections relative to confirmed cases on the first day that exceeds 100 confirmed cases t  0 that is   i 0 c 0  higher values for  imply greater levels of undocumented spread ahead of the earliest reported cases and smaller values of  represents effective identification quarantine and early contact tracing using data obtained from the johns hopkins university see materials and methods bayesian parameter inference

computation materials and methods 12 is applied to adaptively sample the approximate posterior distributions for all eight model parameters and posterior predictive distributions for the number of active confirmed cases recoveries and deaths over time note that we analyse each country independently although a global model could also be considered see discussion for almost all countries the posterior predictive median lies close to the observed time series and is almost always contained within the 95 credible intervals fig 1 provides examples of the model performance for the united states  fig 1a  italy  fig 1b  australia  fig 1c  china  fig 1d  south korea  fig 1e  and taiwan  fig 1f   and 95 credible interval shaded region of the posterior predictive distributions is plotted for active cases blue recoveries yellow and deaths red this is compared against observations as recorded in data for active cases circles recoveries squares and deaths crosses all 103 countries in this study the model fits for china  fig 1d  and south korea  fig 1e  are the only exceptions the inaccuracy of the active trajectory for china is at least partly due to the changes in reporting methodology from china on 13 february 43  however this does not explain the overestimation of the early recovery period for both china and south korea we discuss potential model improvements to account for this in the discussion section notwithstanding this our model appears to be sufficiently accurate for a broad comparative analysis of global responses to covid-19 during this period the marginal posterior distributions for the parameters  0 residual transmission rate  regulated transmission rate  case recovery rate and  case fatality rate see figs s1 and s2 in supplementary material are similar across countries this is expected as these parameters mainly describe the sars-cov-2 infection itself rather than differing national responses for the period up to 31 march exceptions include a higher uncertainty in death rate for honduras higher uncertainty in recovery rate for nigeria and venezuela and increased uncertainty in the  0 parameter of afghanistan cameroon cuba honduras cambodia mauritius nigeria palestine and venezuela the data also appear to be uninformative for the relative recovery rate  since the posterior is very close to the prior fig s3  the posterior marginals for the identification rate  the regulatory parameter n and the initial infected scale parameter  relate to the nature of the initial outbreak and subsequent response as a result there is significant variation in these distributions across countries figs s3 and s4 to investigate global patterns we compute for each country the marginal posterior means for the parameters  n and  fig 2 shows the distribution of these point estimates across all countries and highlights countries having the highest cumulative confirmed cases to date 31 march 2020 without a decline in active

response n  1 is not equivalent to a slow response in time in ascending order the five smallest values for 6 23  it is unexpected that the value of n for china is low since strong lockdown measures were taken in hubei 23  we expect this is due to the absence of clinically diagnosed cases reported before to 13 february 43  it is also important to note that small n does not mean that npis were not effective but rather that they became effective at higher tallies of confirmed cases france iran turkey and the united states also have comparable values for  but did not experience a decline in active cases in the time frame of the study these countries have a larger value for  indicating a large number of latent infections at an earlier stage of the outbreak therefore a delay in the effect is expected with   1586 95 ci 1567 1606 iran is a particularly extreme example of this as there was significant undetected spread of sars-cov-2 through the volumes of pilgrims passing through the city of qom 15  of the severely affected countries the united kingdom has the closest signature to taiwan and singapore albeit with a higher  and lower n the larger  likely implies early unobserved transmission prior to abandonment of herd immunity targets in favour of social distancing and closing of non-essential business and schools 16 27  australia has a very similar characterisation to the united kingdom with higher  but also higher n that likely reflects the introduction of travel bans and social gathering restrictions introduced in the second half of march overall our modelling approach identifies features of how communities globally respond to the covid-19 pandemic without explicit modelling of specific npis we obtain results that are consistent with the intervention strategies of the most severely affected countries globally we see a low tolerance regulatory response with many countries having high values of n unfortunately most countries also have large values of  indicating that delays in early detection have lead to a larger unobserved infectious population as a result the active case curve will take longer to turn around this downturn could be brought forward by increasing  through increased identification and quarantineisolation capacity these results are for the period 22 jan-31 march in the next section we consider an additional two weeks of data the period 1-13 apr provide refined parameter estimates and offer insights into the evolution of the pandemic the fast moving evolution of epidemics and pandemics such as covid-19 demand that model outputs and the corresponding effectiveness of mitigating measures are regularly re-assessed we re-evaluate our model estimates and inferences for 103 countries that satisfied our inclusion criteria see materials and methods over the period 22 january-13 april 2020 these results reveal that as the pandemic evolves we can learn more about the possible response histories and latent

these point estimates is shown in fig 3 a-c with the same countries highlighted as in fig 2  for the top eight countries still experiencing severe outbreaks on 31 march there is a significant shift in these parameter estimates using data for the period 22 january-13 april there is also a reduction in the uncertainty for some parameters overall see supplementary material fig s5-s8  these shifts demonstrated in fig 3 d-f have some broad trends in fig 3d and f all eight countries show a decrease in the parameter n with france iran turkey the united kingdom and the united states having the most substantial declines this indicates that in light of more recent data the community response to the outbreak had a higher tolerance to growing case numbers than earlier data indicated fig 3d and e indicate that most of these countries have a lower identification rate however it is promising to see a small increase in  for germany and switzerland and a large increase in  for italy and spain this is possibly a reflection of increased testing capabilities within these countries between 31 march to 13 april httpsourworldindataorgcoronavirus accessed 14 april overall there is also a decrease in  indicating that the number of early undocumented cases could be lower than previously thought one concerning exception is italy with an increase in the point estimate with   0956 95 ci 0924 0988 australia also shows a decrease in the value of n  0703 95 ci 0693 0713 but also a decrease in   0259 95 ci 0240 0278 this suggests the australian community was overall more tolerant of higher case numbers but the undocumented case 7 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020  numbers were lower than previously expected australia shows an increase in   0456 95 ci04400472 which is consistent with a high identification rate of symptomatic cases 32  comparing fig 2a -c with fig 3a -c highlights the dynamical nature on the covid-19 pandemic in particular changes in the parameters n and  indicate that our understanding of the past trajectory of the outbreak is also evolving this is a particular strength of our modelling approach in that we can characterise how sensitive a community response is to growing case numbers our framework is also flexible enough to include community responses to other factors that may be prescribed through an arbitrary utility metric see materials and methods and supplementary material as stated above the regulatory parameter n does not provide insight into the full management of the outbreak it simply provides a measure of how the transmission rate declines as a function of confirmed case counts see materials and methods we compute several derived quantities that provide a more complete view of how countries are managing the pandemic specifically we consider the following quantities the case death rate relative to the case recovery rate  the case removal rate relative to identification rate    the relative strength of transmission rate regulation f c 0   f c t f c 0  where f  is the transmission rate regulatory function see materials and methods and respectively c 0  and c t  are the number of confirmed cases at the start of the outbreak first day exceeding 100 confirmed cases and at the end of the data period 13 april and the relative reduction in the basic reproduction number 10  r 0  r e r 0  where r 0 is the basic reproductive number at the start of the outbreak and r e is the basic reproduction number at the end of the data period see supplementary material point estimates of these ratios are computed through expectations with respect to the full joint parameter posterior distributions see materials and methods and supplementary material for each country fig 4a shows the distribution of point estimates related to management and treatment of confirmed cases the effective management of covid-19 cases within germany can be inferred by a low value for the relative case fatality rate   0083 95 ci 00700086 and high value for the case removal rate relative to identification rate     112 95 ci 076148 the united kingdom is an outlier with a very high   4132 95 ci264 8001 we expect this is due to a discrepancy in the data for recoveries in the united kingdom with only 626 recoveries recorded china is another outlier with     666 95 ci 0 1373 due to relatively poor model fit for china as discussed above fig 4b shows that globally there is a high level of regulation with f c 0   f c t f c 0   07 that is regulatory strength greater than 70 of maximum for nearly all countries despite this there are many countries with only moderate reductions in the basic reproductive number indicating that more testing is required or a higher level of residual transmission  0  in particular the second outbreak occurring within singapore in the later period of study is identified by a high level regulation but very little decrease in the basic reproductive number fortunately the basic reproduction number reduced by at least 50 for all of the most severely affected countries 8 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the

analyse the historical trajectory and community response to the covid-19 pandemic however our approach also enables predictions that account for uncertainty in the undocumented infected population and in the community tolerance of rising cases there are many unknowns within the current pandemic that affect the accuracy of model prediction 20 28  in particular we have no estimates for the number of undocumented cases world wide furthermore inadequate uncertainty quantification can lead to unrealistic credible prediction intervals 28  we use our bayesian framework to handle both uncertainty in model parameters and uncertainty in undocumented infected population regarding prediction uncertainty we take a conservative approach that provides predictions accounting for uncertainty in the evolution up to the current time we perform this by sampling from the posterior predictive distribution and continue model evolution to the prediction horizon in this way we consider uncertainty in all possible histories parameter values and latent population evolution to quantify uncertainty in predictions conditional on the model formulation using posterior distributions of parameters computed using data up to 13 april we quantify prediction uncertainty over a 7 day prediction horizon example predictions for active cases recoveries and deaths median and 95 credible interval are shown in fig 5 for the united states fig 5a  italy fig 5b  spain fig 5c  germany fig 5d  taiwan fig 5e  and australia fig 5f  our approach produced wide credible intervals as a result of parameter uncertainty and uncertainty in undocumented infections there is a wide range of possible scenarios for undocumented infection populations sizes that are completely consistent with the data 26  by continuing simulations from the posterior predictive distribution we take an ensemble of these scenarios into 9 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020   our predictions for the united states show a continuing increase in the number of active cases fig 5a  an increase in active cases is predicted for italy fig 5b  although the decline in the lower bound of the credible interval indicates the possibility of a flattening of active case counts in future weeks predictions for spain and germany fig 5cd  also indicate a flattening out in the number of active cases over the prediction horizon for taiwan and australia fig 5e f the median predictions show a decline in active cases however the uncertainty is still substantial the key message from this analysis is to highlight the importance of conservative uncertainties in the future evolution of the pandemic it is encouraging to see predictions that indicate potential future declines in active cases counts however uncertainties in the number of undocumented cases and model parameters indicate caution in predicting the timing of consistent declines in active case numbers therefore it is essential that communities remain vigilant in fast-evolving situations such as this we have applied a novel stochastic epidemiological model to characterise the response to the covid-19 pandemic for 103 countries worldwide over the period 22 january-13 april 2020 we find that the worst affected countries in terms of confirmed case numbers including the united states italy spain and germany are characterised by a response with high tolerance to rising case numbers ie small n however increased testing and isolation protocols large  have demonstrably reduced the longer term impact as demonstrated by china and south korea many countries seem to be learning from these 10 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020  collective experiences as many countries have a low tolerance for rising case numbers large n unfortunately we also identify that the number of undocumented cases likely exceeded the confirmed cases for many countries large  it is important to emphasise that we do not make any specific guidelines for particular countries in improving specific non-pharmaceutical intervention npi or testing strategies however through the lens of our model we advise that effective actions should begin at lower case numbers rather than having a high tolerance to rising cases our model like any model has fundamental assumptions that are necessarily introduced we treat each country as a single well-mixed population while our approach does include important features such as undocumented infections and a variable transmission rate more advanced analysis could be performed by considering disease spread through a network 8 13 24 38 of well-mixed populations such as provinces and states we also treat each country as a closed system whereas realistic sources and sinks through inclusion of an international travel network could enable us to track the impact of decisions of one country on connected countries other details of the model could also be extended we treat active confirmed cases as non-infectious due to quarantine and isolation in reality active confirmed cases can still spread the virus to medical staff we also apply the reasonable approximation that there is no re-detection or re-infection however new evidence is questioning the validity of this assumption 27  a finer granularity of classes of susceptible individuals ie at risk incubation periods and severity of symptoms would also enable more detailed analysis for an individual country 20 32  however our reduced set of classes is a trade-off between realism and broad applicability to worldwide data a bayesian hierarchical modelling approach could also be applied to better capture heterogeneity across countries our model framework is flexible through the inclusion of a utility function u a t  r t  d t  see materials and methods in the regulatory mechanism and may be extended to other scenarios we have only considered the case of a utility dependent on cumulative cases u a t  r t  d t   a t  r t  d t  c t  or deaths only u a t  r t  d t   d t see materials and methods and supplementary material however the utility function could include economical factors or be modified to be a function of state and time this would enable a wide range of behaviours to be explored such as specific timings of enforced npis and subsequent lifting of restrictions when active case go below a threshold it is hoped that our work might be used to inform future responses to outbreaks of covid-19 or other pandemics the message is clear we must not be complacent in response to an outbreak as the earliest confirmed cases arise while many countries have managed to reduce transmission and basic reproductive numbers a response with a lower tolerance to rising confirmed case numbers is recommended for the future we also highlight the importance of wider testing to effectively reduce uncertainty in predictions of case numbers recoveries and deaths this section presents details on the

population division estimates wwwworldometersinfoworld-populationpopulation-by-country accessed 14 april 2020 our analysis is performed over two different periods i 22 january-31 march 2020 and ii 22 january-13 april our inclusion criteria for period i are countries for which there was at least one day exceeding 100 confirmed cases of covid-19 between before 30 march 2020 of all countries with confirmed cases n  103 countries satisfied our criteria for period i similarly for period ii we include countries with at least one day exceeding 100 confirmed cases of covid-19 before 12 april 2020 for each country i  1 2     n  we process the raw data to produce a time-series where a ti  r ti  and d ti are the active cases recoveries and deaths on day t in country i here day t  0 is the first day to exceed 100 active cases while it is known that there are variations in reporting protocols across countries and time we make the necessary simplifying assumption in our analysis that the quantities a ti  r ti  and d ti have an equivalent interpretation across all countries over time we apply a stochastic epidemiological model to describe the spread of covid-19 within a single country that is a assumed to have a well-mixed population here s is the population of those susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection i is the latent infected population a are the active confirmed cases of covid-19 r are confirmed recoveries d are confirmed deaths caused by covid-19 and r u are those that recover from covid-19 but where never confirmed the cumulative confirmed cases are given by c  a  r  d the individual counts within each population are updated according to the following transition events where ga r d  0 is the effective transmission rate function   0 is the identification rate   0 is the case recovery rate   0 is the case fatality rate and  is the latent recovery rate relative to the case recovery rate at time t  0 days the system state is given by the population counts s t  i t  a t  r t  d t  and r u t and evolves according to a discrete-state continuous-time markov process supplementary material we apply the tau-leaping numerical scheme 18 supplementary material as exact stochastic simulation was computationally infeasible at time t  0 first day exceeding 100 active cases a 0  r 0  and d 0 are obtained from time-series data for unobserved states we initially set i 0  a 0  r u 0  0 and s 0  p  c 0  i 0 where p is total population record for the country and   0 is the number of unobserved cases relative to active cases at t  0 the transmission rate is described as a function of observables of the form ga t  r t  d t    0  f a t  r t  d t  here f a t  r t  d t  is a decreasing function in a measure of utility u a t  r t  d t   is a scale factor such that f a t  r t  d t  is a transmission rate that decreases as the utility function increases and  0 is the residual transmission rate as f a t  r t  d t   0 we assume the form f a t  r t  d t   11  u a t  r t  d t  n  we find a utility function based on cumulative confirmed case numbers u a t  r t  d t   a t  r t  d t  c t  provides a good fit across all countries that we consider excepting changes in reporting methodology for china on 13 feb 43  however we also investigate a utility function that only considers deaths u a t  r t  d t   d t  but model fitting was inferior see supplementary material there is a wide variety of utility functions that could be considered to model specific country npis and behaviours therefore we simplify our notation and consider f c t   11  c n t  where the parameter n  0 controls the rate of decrease as shown in fig 6  given an initial number of confirmed cases c 0  we have  0  gc t    0  f c 0  note the shape of f c t  starts to decline rapidly before starting to level out increasing n shifts the initial decline to the left effectively altering the critical values of c t in which a population begins to maximise efforts to flatten the curve for example small n describes a population that does not significantly reduce the transmission rate until the confirmed case tally is large conversely larger n describes a population that acts decisively as a response to very early stages of the outbreak importantly our approach does not distinguish between different npis and voluntary population behaviour but rather models the net effect of rising confirmed cases on transmission rates the parameter  is used to initialise the unobserved infected population i 0  a 0  and indicates the outbreak extent within the community at time t  0 small  indicates that efforts of testing and contact tracing have been very effective at early time whereas large  implies the virus has spread extensively without early intervention using time-series data d i for each country i

lopinavirritonavir for its antivirus effect 24 our previous use of this drug combination found that the effect of lopinavirritonavir on covid-19 was unsatisfactory as it only helps to improve the minority of throat-swab nucleic-acid results 315 chloroquine is not only used as an antimalarial drug but is also used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases due to its immunomodulatory activity 5 previous studies have shown that chloroquine exerts antiviral effects through the following mechanisms
it can change the ph of acidic organelles 6 such as endosomes so inhibits infections such as borna disease virus 7 avian leukemia virus 8 and zika virus 9it can change the glycosylation pattern of the hiv virus gp120 envelope which inhibits the replication of hiv human immunodeficiency virus virus in cd4  t cells 10it can effectively inhibit autophagy in the lungs of avian influenza h5n1 mice and reduce the damage to the alveolar epithelium 11it inhibits viral replication by blocking the autophagy phenomenon induced by the zika virus and can cut off vertical infection of the zika virus from the maternal-fetal pathway 12 multiple studies have found that chloroquine has anti-sars-cov activity
chloroquine can inhibit viral replication by reducing the terminal glycosylation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on vero e6 cells and interfering with the binding of sars-cov to the ace2 receptor 13 14chloroquine inhibits the replication of hcov-229e and sars-cov both belong to the -group hcovs by inhibiting the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk in the l132 human embryonic-lung-cell line 15the spike protein s protein of sars-cov-2 is similar in structure to that of sars-cov and can bind to the ace2 receptor on the host-cell surface to infect the host epithelial cells 16remdesivir gs-5734 and chloroquine sigma-c6628 can effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 infection 17 this study will compare the efficacy safety and impact on patient compliance between the chloroquine phosphate regimen with the lopinavirritonavir regimen in mildgeneral covid-19 infection this randomized controlled trial is to be conducted at the fifth affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university the ninth peoples hospital of dongguan zhongshan second peoples hospital and jiangmen central hospital these hospitals are located in guangdong china the clinical research flowchart crf of the research process is shown in fig 1

software to set the number of centers at four the block size will be four the number of blocks will be 28 using a 1 1 ratio between the experimental group and the control group will generate 112 random numbers and corresponding grouping information according to the haphazard allocation table used in advance the statistical expert gives random numbers 1112 in ascending order each random number and grouping information correspond to an envelope the envelope is sealed and given to the researchers responsible for screening qualified subjects are selected and the envelopes are received in the order of enrollment after the envelopes are opened the random-number and grouping information is removed so that the subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group and the corresponding treatment and observations performed each subjects random number is unique and remains the same throughout the trial the hypothesis of this study is that the use of chloroquine phosphate instead of lopinavirritonavir will increase the rate of throat-swab sars-cov-2 nucleic-acid negative conversion the main therapeutic index of this study is the clinical recovery time after no more than 28 days which is from the beginning of the study drug intervention treatment to the normalization of body temperature respiratory symptoms respiratory rate and blood-oxygen saturation in the later analysis the log-rank method is used to compare the differences in clinical recovery time between the two groups of patients the sample size of this study is calculated based on the log-rank method by using the log-rank test lakatos median survival time module in the pass 110 statistical software see additional file sample size report for details based on clinical experience 4 18 the median clinical recovery time of the patients in the control group is expected to be 8 days and the median clinical recovery time of patients in the experimental group can be shortened to 4 days corresponding hazard ratio hr  20 112 patients 56 in each group will be required to detect this difference with a significant level of   005 both sides with 85 confidence interval the trial is planned to be enrolled for 90 days followed up for 28 days and a final analysis is performed after 78 clinical recovery events occur it is estimated that the drop-out rate of the experimental group and the control group is 5 the results of this study for efficacy outcomes will be analyzed based on both intention-to-treat itt and per-protocol pp approaches with a primary consideration for itt results a

the fifth affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university zdwy2020 lunzi no k151 randomized controlled studies still have some design limitations first the sample size we use is relatively small and the 28-day treatment period is short therefore we will not be able to estimate possible relapses of pneumonia after long-term treatment second the pathophysiology of novel coronavirus pneumonia has not been elucidated as only clinician assessment is used including lung computed tomography ct results and count of viral load there is no objective indicator to judge the effect of treatment on covid-19 infection finally the follow-up period in this study was relatively short in light of these limitations we will develop a more reasonable treatment cycle and follow-up period to explore the efficacy of chloroquine in patients with covid-19 we also know that there will be many biases in the open trial and we have taken a number of measures to control the possible bias in the trial as follows 1 strict exclusion criteria are formulated to effectively control other confounding factors that may affect the efficacy 2 the trial uses random grouping to ensure that the two groups of patients are comparable 3 before the patient signs the informed consent form the researchers and the patients make full communication to ensure that the patients understand the entire trial content and try to eliminate the impact of the patients psychological state on the trial effect 4 the main and secondary indicators for evaluating the efficacy are objective indicators to avoid the influence of subjective factors 5 before the start of the trial the researchers will conduct unified system training to ensure the uniformity and correctness of data collection and index evaluation the trial was

merscov has been documented in more than 2000 cases worldwide causing 722 related deaths from september 2012 through september 20171 much research evidence is available on factors associated with a poor prognosis in laboratoryconfirmed merscov2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and nonmerscov9 10 11 patients a high mortality rate was systematically recognized in merscov patients of old age2 12 13 14 15 severe illness2 12 13 14 underlying condition2 12 13 14 and respiratorygastrointestinal symptoms2 however successful management of merscov such as clinical recovery and its predictors has not been given sufficient attention despite the virus having been in circulation since 2012 as per the authors knowledge two studies have so far addressed clinical improvement on laboratoryconfirmed merscov patients16 17 the first study shalhoub et al16 was based on a case report in which their observations may not be generalized to a wider merscov population the second study alturaiki et al17 utilized publicly available data from the saudi ministry of health the major shortcomings in their study were several potential confounding factors such as underlying medical conditions and a primary or secondary mode of merscov transmission that had not been included in the analysis in addition the recovery delay was not reported in their study and thus factors related to the recovery delay were not examined as of october 4 2017 there was no available detailed data on recovery delay of laboratoryconfirmed merscov and nonmerscov patients data on the time intervals between a patients presentation or admission to a healthcare facility and the first specimen sample have been limited in patients suspected and screened for merscov by a realtime reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction rrtpcr test as it might correlate with recovery delay intervals early screening and diagnosis of merscov could greatly promote proper control and clinical management of cases which may reduce the risk of transmission and increase the chance of successful outcomes18 19 20 this study provides more understanding of how long a period in days it may take to recover from merscov infection the authors have studied retrospectively a cohort of survivorslaboratoryconfirmed merscov and nonmerscov patientsto estimate recovery delay intervals and identify possible associated factors in saudi arabia the authors assessed whether the time interval between presentation and the initial rrtpcr diagnosis diagnosis delay correlates with the time interval between initial rrtpcr diagnosis and recovery recovery delay we hypothesized that older age merscov infection icu admission and abnormal radiology findings might be associated with longer recovery delay we hypothesized that diagnosis delay might positively correlate with a recovery delay the analysis was conducted using ibm statistical package for social sciences spss 24 spss chicago il patients characteristics were described by count and percent and mean  standard deviation or median where appropriate time intervals in days from presentation to initial rrtpcr diagnosis diagnosis delay and from initial rrtpcr diagnosis to recovery recovery delay were analyzed by spearmans correlation coefficient the poisson and negative binomial models were used to model the frequency of recovery delay in days and identify unadjusted and adjusted factors associated with longer recovery delay goodnessoffit measures were used to compare and identify the best model the model with the smaller deviance larger log likelihood smaller akaike information criterion and smaller bayesian information criterion was considered the better model in all analyses a pvalue of less than 5 was considered significant relative risk rr and 95 confidence intervals ci were used to assess the strength of association between patients characteristics and longershorter recovery delay a total of 396 patients suspected and screened for merscov by an rrtpcr

smaller akaike information criterion 209508 vs 333119 and smaller bayesian information criterion 215666 vs 339278 than the poisson model this is the first study identifying predictors of recovery delay in days in a large sample of laboratoryconfirmed merscov and nonmerscov patients despite recovery delay being an important indicator of merscov infection progression it remains poorly understood in this population the data were collected from two of the largest tertiary hospitals in saudi arabia kamcr and kfghjed from september 2012 to june 2016 according to our research evidence suggests that there are a number of factors that affect the course of recovery delay in suspected merscov patients whose clinical samples were evaluated by the rrtpcr test older age 65 years or over was a major predictor of longer recovery delay in our sample this was noted by alturaiki et al as well17 in other recent studies being of older age was a factor for worse clinical outcomes such as infection severity13 and death2 13 14 in merscov patients this age group has been linked to a number of preexisting medical conditions and other health risks which can also increase the risk of longer recovery delay in this population it is essential that the healthcare practitioners who provide direct medical care to suspected merscov patients most carefully monitor infection development to avoid poor outcomes in elderly patients as expected the risk of longer recovery delay was twice as high in patients with merscov infection than patients without merscov infection this finding could be attributed to several factors merscov is a serious illness and is very common in patients in the older age group2 12 13 14 15 and patients with preexisting medical conditions2 11 12 13 14 and these seem to increase the risk of early mortality after diagnosis2 furthermore most merscov patients develop severe pneumonia22 and necessitate mechanical ventilation11 which is a risk factor for hospital mortality23
 patients admitted to icu admission were at higher risk for longer recovery delay a previous report showing similar findings longer icu stay and high mortality rate was reported in merscov patients who were admitted to the icu24 such patients would benefit from monitoring their responses to medical support and recognizing potential complications at an early stage we found that camel contact was associated with shorter recovery delay studies on recovery delay in patients with camel contact as compared to close contact exposure of a confirmed case or other exposure are lacking however camel contact has also been linked to lower 3 and 30day mortality rates in merscov patients2 this important association requires more studies to identify whether camel contact is an independent protective factor of shorter recovery delay in our study patients with respiratory symptoms are more likely to experience shorter recovery delay than patients without respiratory symptoms this finding is probably related to the shorter lag time between symptom onset and diagnosis in which patients with presence of symptoms could be positively affected by an early diagnosis18 and thus prompt medical support is deemed necessary the time interval from presentation to initial rrtpcr diagnosis diagnosis delay was positively correlated with the time interval from initial rrtpcr diagnosis to recovery recovery delay early diagnosis is likely to improve clinical outcomes18 and reduce the economic and physical burden of a disease25 26 early diagnosis requires full utilization of hospital resources individuals at high risk of merscov infection should be promptly screened after arrival at the healthcare facility monitored for progression and then having a prompt decision made for whether further rrtpcr testing is needed the authors noticed the following limitations first the study was based on chart reviews and findings should be interpreted with caution second we did not collect information on the type of antiviral treatment or other supportive treatments given after diagnosis which may have affected clinical outcomes27 28 third despite this being the first investigation in this population including a number of potential predictors for recovery delay additional relevant predictors should be explored such as the level of camel exposure for example hospitalacquired infections fourth patients with clinical recovery were identified by reviewing the medical records of the study sample within 60 days after the initial rrtpcr diagnosis studies with longer periods of followup in a larger population recovering from merscov are warranted to assess the longterm successful clinical outcomes despite the mentioned limitations data were aggregated directly from medical charts rather than public source databases this chart review study was based on information from multicenters and a large sample size and it provides valuable information on factors associated with prolonged or shorter recovery delay of patients suspected and screened for merscov by the rrtpcr test it is essential to develop interventional programs or guidelines to ensure early diagnosis as this may reduce recovery delay intervals as well as improve patients clinical outcomes this research may enable identification of patients who require receiving appropriate medical support and care according to their illness progression this also may prevent spread and transmission of the infection as individuals who are still severely ill can be appropriately isolated and managed apart from others who are responding to medical care the study evidence supports that longer recovery delay was seen in patients with older age merscov infection icu admission and abnormal radiology findings in a sample of patients diagnosed by rrtpcr recovery delay was significantly shorter in patients who had camel contact and respiratory symptoms at presentation a prospective study is needed to evaluate the impact of camel exposure on recovery evidence was found of an increasing recovery delay with a longer diagnosis delay the findings may help understand clinical decision making as it directs hospital resources toward prompt screening monitoring and implementing clinical recovery and treatment strategies there are no conflict of interests  persistence of lung inflammation and lung cytokines with

sars-cov has been identified as the causative agent 2 typical clinical manifestations include fever cough dyspnea and rapid progression of pulmonary infiltration or consolidation 3 the mean mortality rate is 96 1 mostly attributed to hypoxemic respiratory failure in the acute phase typical pathological findings in the lungs include mononuclear cells infiltration alveolar cell desquamation and hyaline membrane formation 4 those mononuclear cells may develop into multinucleated giant cells 4 proinflammatory cytokines released by alveolar macrophages may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis in sars 5 marked elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and il-12 of the th1 cytokine ifn- and of chemokines il-8 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 and ifn--induced protein-10 ip-10 have been reported 6 high resolution computed tomography hrct findings at presentation include as unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral or bilateral areas of consolidation 7-9 such residual abnormalities have been described also after discharge from hospital at 365 days and at 6-months 1011 however limited information is available on recovery of inflammatory abnormalities during recovery from sars particularly at 60 days and beyond in the current study we conducted a study to examine hrct changes in patients who recovered from the acute phase of sars at days 60 and 90 and measured the associated inflammatory profiles directly by examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf we also examined the presence of coronavirus in balf we found persistence of hrct abnormalities and of lung inflammation at day 60 and determined retrospectively the potential influence of pulse corticosteroid therapy in this process twelve 9 women and 3 men aged 18 to 51 years of 28 confirmed sars patients who were treated in chang gung memorial hospital in taiwan between april and may 2003 during the last epidemic of sars in taiwan agreed to participate

to exclude bacterial or fungal infections at 90 days all the close contact relatives of the study sars patients had their serum anti-coronavirus antibody measured by elisa nine non-smoking healthy volunteers 5 women and 4 men aged 18 to 40 years without evident current or past history of pulmonary diseases based on history as well as physical chest radiographic and bronchoscopic examinations were selected as controls for this study none of them had any upper respiratory tract infection within the last 6 weeks or was on antibiotics or other medications at the time of evaluation the study protocol was approved by chang gung memorial hospital ethical committee informed consent was obtained from all the subjects treatment of sars patients on admission to our unit included broad spectrum antibiotics to target common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia according to current recommendations 1314 these patients received variable therapy regimens including oral ribavirin 1 g

patients depending on the attending physicians decision irrespective of severity of presentation some patients who did not receive pulse steroid therapy were given a short course of corticosteroid therapy hydrocortisone 100 mg 3 timesday for 3 days if there was rapid deterioration of pulmonary infiltration or hypoxemia maintenance steroid therapy prednisolone 10 mg per day for one week was given after pulse or short course corticosteroid therapy in all patients two patients were intubated with ventilator support because of hypoxemic respiratory failure patients underwent hrct and bal on the 60th and 90th day after the onset of disease hrct was performed with 1- to 2-mm collimation sections reconstructed by the use of a high spatial frequency algorithm using a general electric medical systems milwaukee wi the hrct protocol consisted of thin sections obtained at 10-mm through the chest in a supine position without using intravenous contrast medium the hrct findings as previously described 9 were categorized the predominant pattern as normal attenuation ground glass opacification hazy areas of increased attenuation without obscuration of the underlying vessels consolidation homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma with obscuration of the underlying vessels reticular pattern mixed pattern combination of consolidation ground glass opacities and reticular opacities in the presence of architectural distortion ground-glass attenuation with traction bronchiolectasis or bronchiectasis and honeycomb pattern the extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed independently for each of three zones upper above the carina middle below carina up to the inferior pulmonary vein and lower below the inferior pulmonary vein each lung zone total of 6 lung zones was assigned a score modified from previously described 9 based on the following 0 when no involvement 1 when 25 involvement 2 when 25 50 involvement 3 when 50 75 involvement and 4 when 75 involvement

confirmed diagnosis of sars were admitted during the study period sixteen patients received intubation and ventilatory support for respiratory failure three died of intractable hypoxemic respiratory failure twenty-five patients recovered subsequently and were discharged from the hospital no patient relapsed with either fever or new pulmonary infiltrates after discharge from the hospital twenty of the 25 patients were randomly selected into the protocol and twelve agreed to participate these patients complied with the protocol at 60 days but at 90 days only 10 of 12 patients agreed to have a repeat hrct and 6 of 12 patients had a follow-up bronchoscopy at 60 days the commonest symptoms in sars patients were general weakness 8 of 12 patients exertional dyspnea 6 of 12 patients joint pains 4 of 12 patients and partial hair loss 11 of 12 patients at 90 days all the 12 sars patients were well without any of the above-described symptoms there was no detectable sars-cov antibody in the sera of close contact relatives of the study patients even though sars patients were not isolated after discharge from hospital from their close relatives at 60 days 5 sars patients were found with an hrct abnormality of 10  of the total lung field in 3 the score was zero in one ground glass attenuation was found in 75 of total lung field and in another there was consolidation in 17 of total lung field the other 7 sars patients had hrct abnormality  10 of each lung field a mean of 375  79 involvement of total lung field table 1 the most prominent hrct findings in these patients were ground-glass attenuation 808  122 of total abnormality on hrct and consolidation 136  109 of total abnormality on hrct honeycombing and bronchiectatic changes were found in only 3 sars patients with high hrct score 55  27 of total abnormality on hrct seven of 11 patients were found normal on their follow-up hrct at 90 days table 2 figure 1 two of the patients had persistently high hrct scores table 1 one with very high hrct score at 60 days refused a follow-up hrct the residual abnormality on hrct at 60 days was related to the clinical course univariate analysis identified 3 factors associated with the residual abnormality on hrct there were a greater proportion of patients receiving pulse steroid therapy 4 of 7 in patients with high hrct score table 2 in contrast none of the patients with low hrct score received pulse steroid therapy table 2 there was no significant difference in other therapy including maintenance or short course corticosteroid therapy ivig or ribavirin between patients with high hrct score and those with low hrct score table 2 patients with high hrct score had significantly longer course of fever and higher serum sars-cov antibody titer when compared to those in patients with low hrct score table 2 at 60 days compared to normal subjects there was a significant increase in total cell counts in bal fluid from sars patients table 3 with a significant increase in alveolar macrophages am and lymphocytes the proportion of cd8 t cells was increased to a greater extent than cd4 t cells leading to a significant decrease in cd4cd8 ratio table 4 there was also a significant increase in the proportion of nk cells in sars patients table 4 there was no significant difference in b lymphocytes between sars patients with low or high hrct scores and normal subjects hrct scores were highly correlated with the cell counts of total lymphocyte cd4 and cd8 t cells and inversely related to the cd4cd8 ratio figure 2 at 90 days the cellular profiles in bal fluid of 6 sars patients were significantly improved compared with those at 60 days with near normalization tables 3 4 at 60 days sars patients had a significantly higher level of chemokines il-8 mcp-1 and rantes table 5 and of pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf- and il-6 however the growth factors transforming growth factor- tgf- epidermal growth factor egf insulin-like growth factor-1 igf-1 were not increased table 5 the 12 enrolled patients had serological evidence of recent infection with the sars-cov and in seven viral rna was detected in samples taken from nasopharyngeal aspirate or stool however viral rna was not detectable in the stool or nasopharyngeal aspirate of any of the sars patients at 60 days healthy controls had no evidence of sars-cov antibody or rna in the serum or the respiratory tract there were no detectable common viruses including influenza viruses a and b rsv virus adenovirus human metapneumovirus and parainfluenzavirus types 1 2 and 3 using ifa for nasopharyngeal aspirates or using rt-pcr assay for cells retrieved by bal at 60 or 90 days serological studies for clamydia mycoplasma or legionella were negative in all subjects at 60 days em examination of bal fluid revealed many coronavirus-infected alveolar macrophages with intracellular viral particles in 7 of 12 patients figure 3 table 1 these patients had the high hrct scan scores coronavirus infected cells were not detected in any of sars patients with low hrct score or in normal subjects table 1 rt-pcr amplification of coronavirus nucleic acids was positive in 3 of 7 patients with high hrct score but in none of patients with low hrct score or normal subjects at 90 days em examination did not detect any coronavirus-infected cells in 6 sars patients in 5 of the 6 viral inclusions were found in am at day 60 table 1 one patient with persistent high hrct score case 12 refused follow-up bal study at 90 days this study was performed during the last epidemic of sars in taiwan and the number of patients recruited has been limited the epidemic did not recur during 2004 and there have been no further cases of sars in taiwan such that we were not able to increase the number of patients in this study despite the relatively low numbers our observations indicate that there are persistent important inflammatory and radiological abnormalities in some patients who have recovered from acute sars at 60 days after the illness these changes were those of ground-glass orand consolidation abnormalities which may be overlooked on examination of plain chest radiographs the bal fluid examination performed for the first time in recovering sars patients confirmed the presence of an on-going active inflammatory process in most patients with increased macrophages nk cells and t cells and augmented levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines these inflammatory responses may be elicited by the persistent presence of coronavirus in alveolar macrophages since the patients with the highest hrct changes had coronaviruses present and there was no evidence of bacterial or other viral infection in these patients most viral diseases are characterized by the development of a specific infiltration consisting predominantly of mononuclear leukocytes while neutrophils are absent 19 the most striking features of alveolar inflammation in patients were increased numbers of alveolar macrophages t lymphocytes and nk cells with a striking decrease in cd4cd8 ratio the hrct score was highly correlated with t lymphocyte numbers and their subpopulations and was inversely related to cd4cd8 ratio cd8 t cells may act as cytotoxic cells and are key effectors of virus clearance 20 the concurrent increase in cd4 t cells may promote the clonal expansion of virus-specific cd8 t cells and is essential for maintaining continued cd8 t cells surveillance and effector capacity 19 exposure of monocytes or macrophages to viruses causes the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-1 and il-6 and chemokines 20-22 as well as members of the cc-chemokine subfamily such as mip-l mcp-1 and rantes which preferentially attract monocytes and lymphocytes 22 the cxc-chemokines such as il-8 or gro- are major neutrophil chemoattractants 23 migcxc chemokine ligand cxcl 9 and ip-10cxcl10 both inducible by interferon- are elr-negative cxc chemokines and are potent chemoattractants for mononuclear cells specifically activated t lymphocytes and nk cells 24 in this report we demonstrated elevated levels of tnf- il-6 mcp-1 rantes and il-8 in bal fluid in sars patients compared to those of normal subjects increased secretion of tnf- and il-6 may be derived from virus-infected macrophages or from cd4 or cd8 t cells and these cytokines may promote t-lymphocyte extravasation and macrophage activation 19 but such processes may not be sufficient on their own to recruit and activate mononuclear cells in virus-infected lungs the increased levels of mcp-1 and rantes in bal fluid of all sars patients may be responsible for the generation of mononuclear infiltrates observed after coronavirus infection ip-10 and mig whose levels are also increase in sars patients recruit monocytes and macrophages nk cells and activated but not resting t lymphocytes 2526 although there were increased levels of il-8 in bal fluid in sars patients the number of neutrophils in balf were sparse the absence of neutrophil infiltration in influenza a virus or respiratory syncytial viruses rsv infection is attributed to the suppression of neutrophil attracting cxc-chemokines or by induction of il-10 27 however il-8 production can be induced by measles virus infection of fibroblasts 28 and by influenza a virus rsv and rhinovirus in pulmonary epithelial cells or am 28-31 the reasons for the lack of neutrophil recruitment in response to elevated il-8 levels in sars patients are not known and this deserves further investigation despite the presence of virus in am at 60 days when patients had already been discharged from hospital these patients were not infectious because none of their close contact relatives developed any detectable sars-cov antibody in their sera the hrct and the clinical course until the 90th day of illness did not suggest any evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in sars patients this was in accord with the low level of cytokines and growth factors responsible for tissue repairing and fibrosis 32 such as il-1 tgf- igf-1 and egf detected in bal fluid however evidence of fibrosis on hrct has been obtained on hrct scans particularly in patients with very severe disease during the acute phase of sars 33 the use of corticosteroids together with ribavirin has been reported to confer clinical benefit although randomized clinical trials to support its clinical efficacy are not available pulse steroid therapy was reported to lead to less oxygen requirement better radiographic outcome and less likelihood to require rescue pulse steroid therapy than their counterparts 34 however corticosteroids have been shown to increase mortality of pneumovirus-infected mice by accelerating replication of virus 35 pulse steroid therapy was also reported to be associated with residual abnormality on hrct in sars patients after discharge from hospital 10 in the current retrospective non-randomized series pulse steroid therapy appeared to be associated with delayed resolution of pneumonitis we have planned a prospective future study on investigating the effect of pulse steroid therapy in case of future outbreaks of sars this is because this issue is extremely important in outcome from sars in conclusion a proportion of recovered sars patients have delayed resolution of pneumonitis and delayed clearance of coronavirus in the alveolar space at day 60 this was associated with persistent inflammatory response characterized by macrophages t cells particularly cd8 t cells and nk cells and by increase in cytokines and chemokines this host inflammatory response against sars-cov infection may contribute to persistent hrct abnormalities during recovery phase of sars on the other hand we found no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in sars patients during recovery at day 90 many of the abnormalities have disappeared patients recovering from sars need to be followed up for at least 3 months after the infection  epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 a systematic review and meta-analysis malahat khalili mohammad karamouzian naser nasiri sara javadi ali mirzazadeh hamid sharifi   the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first identified in a few unusual pneumonia patients linked to the wuhan seafood wholesale market in china in december 2019 1 however it soon grew out of china and the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was declared a pandemic on 11 march 2020 and has been reported in 216 countries areas or territories 2 while the epidemic has slowed down in china due to the strict quarantine and preventive regulations the numbers of covid-19 patients ie 10021401 as of 28 june 2020 and confirmed deaths ie 499913 as of 28 june 2020 are rapidly increasing 2 and have surpassed that of other viruses in the coronavirus family with similar genomes to sars-cov-2 for example sars which emerged in 2003 infected 8098 patients and caused 774 deaths across 29 countries the middle east respiratory syndrome mers which appeared in 2012 led to 2494 patients and 858 deaths across 27 countries 36 the healthcare systems in many countries such as the usa spain italy france uk turkey and iran have been overwhelmed and struggling with the soaring number of patients 7 although our understanding of covid-19s epidemiology is evolving it is assumed that sars-cov-2 is mainly transmitted via droplets and close contacts with people carrying the virus 2 however recent reports have also proposed the possibility of the virus being contracted via various surfaces gastrointestinal transmission 8 and potentially airborne exposures 2 9 based on the existing evidence elderly population those with suppressed immune systems and underlying metabolic cardiovascular or respiratory diseases are at an increased risk for adverse outcomes however recent reports from outside china point to a considerable risk of severe outcomes among the general adult population ie 65 years old 10 11 as we continue to learn more about covid-19 and its characteristics there are many unknowns about its epidemiology such as hospitalisation and recovery-related outcomes that are critical for healthcare system preparedness 12 13 for example the mean number of incubation days for covid-19 varies greatly across the existing literature ranging from 25 14 to 20 days 15 16 our understanding of time from contracting the disease to recovery or death is even more limited in this systematic review and meta-analysis we tried to identify the studies that recruited patients diagnosed with covid-19 and calculate pooled estimates for several epidemiological and clinical outcomes to help provide an overall picture of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 findings of this study could help inform the ongoing public health and public policy practices across the world following the systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma checklist see supplementary table s1 and the peer review of electronic search strategies press guideline 17 18 we searched pubmed embase and google scholar from 1 december 2019 to 11 march 2020 for studies that measured and reported several characteristics of covid-19 eg incubation period hospitalisation death search terms were combined using appropriate boolean operators and included subject heading termskeywords relevant to covid-19 eg novel coronavirus sars-cov2 coronavirus disease please see supplementary table s2 for our sample search strategy quantitative studies were included in the review if they reported incubation period of of sars-cov-2 as well as time from onset of the symptoms to first medical visit intensive care unit icu admission recovery as defined by studies authors or death studies were also included if they reported the number of deaths among patients with a confirmed covid-19 diagnosis studies were included in the meta-analysis if they provided data on the above-mentioned outcomes along with their standard error and sample size case-reports with a sample size of one were removed from the meta-analysis as they did not provide any dispersion estimate studies were not excluded based on language location or measurement method given that this study used secondary data and involved no interaction with humans no ethics approval was required two authors sj and nn completed the abstract and full-text screening independently the full-texts of citations that met our inclusion criteria or were unclear were screened by two independent reviewers sj and nn disagreements over the inclusion of studies were resolved through discussion or by arbitration with the senior author hs duplicate records were excluded data were extracted independently by the two

main outcomes of interests including the number of deaths among confirmed covid-19 patients ie case fatality rate cfr incubation period and time from onset of covid-19 symptoms to first medical visit icu admission recovery and death meta-analysis was performed using statas v151 metan for numerical variables and metaprop for binary variables commands the 95 confidence intervals ci for binary variables were computed using the exact binomial method heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using both the i2 statistic with a cut-off of 50 and the 2 test with p-value 010 19 as all results turned out to be significantly heterogeneous we used random-effects models to calculate the pooled point estimate and 95 ci for the cfr mean time from onset of covid-19 symptoms to first medical visit icu admission recovery and death for the mean incubation period we estimated 99 ci we also conducted a random-effects meta-regression using statas metareg command to identify the sources of heterogeneity and explored the effect of study-level covariates where data were available supplementary table s3 meta-regression was considered when there were at least 10 studies included in the meta-analysis 20 a two-sided p-value 005 was considered as statistically significant we found a total of 1675 non-duplicate studies 57 of which were included in the qualitative synthesis and 43 were included in the meta-analysis fig 1 a description of the main characteristics of the included studies is provided in table 1 the 57 studies included 27 cross-sectional one case-control one retrospective cohort and 28 case seriescase report studies with sample sizes ranging greatly from one in case-reports to 58 182 for a study in the hubei province 21 inclusion criteria varied greatly across the studies but most study participants were hospitalised patients living or travelling from various provinces in china median range age of the participants was 462 range 17 days to 785 years and about 60 were male most studies were conducted between january and february 2020 clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients included in the study are presented in table 2 among studies that reported exposure history among their participants most patients were directly or indirectly traced back to the city wuhan eg lived in wuhan or had recently travelled to wuhan and the huanan seafood market in hubei province china several cases of contracting sars-cov-2 through close contacts with family members were also reported across the studies frequent ct or x-ray findings included thickened texture of the lungs bilateral focal consolidation lobar consolidation ground-glass opacity patchy consolidation and unilateralbilateral pneumonia common symptoms reported across the studies included fever cough shortness of breath and fatigueweakness only 15 studies reported some information about the pre-existing conditions of the patients most of whom had metabolic and

 we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 based on the existing evidence as of 11 march 2020 our findings suggest that covid-19 has an average incubation period of 568 days and there is a lag of 492 days from onset of symptoms to the first clinical visit on average the symptoms of the patients lasted less than 20 days 1855 days before recovery was achieved and the cfr among confirmed covid-19 patients was 2 which significantly increased by age similar to previous studies 77 fever dry cough shortness of breath and fatigue were common symptoms among the patients in the included studies as expected history of direct or indirect exposure to wuhan was frequently reported the most common radiologic findings were bilateral consolidation and pneumonia 78 79 we found the average incubation period of covid-19 infection to be less than 6 days which is broadly consistent with previously reported estimates 23 29 80 81 the right tail of the 99 ci of the incubation period for covid-19 was less than 7 days 659 this finding is of particular interest as there are many uncertainties about the incubation period of covid-19 for example both the world health organization and centers for disease control and prevention in the usa suggest an incubation period of 214 days however single outlier cases as long as 19 47 24 15 or 27 days 16 have been reported estimates that are possibly reflecting a double exposure our findings are of particular importance for quarantine-related policies and planning and suggest that the current 14-day quarantine period might be rather conservative indeed we found that except for one small study from china in anyang city on a cluster of six patients 47 all other studies reported incubation periods less than 106 days therefore a shorter period of 14 days would suffice and almost all people exposed to sars-cov-2 would show symptoms within 11 days of their initial exposure all in all decisions to modify or keep the existing policies need to weigh the costs of extending active quarantine against the potential or costs of missing a few patients with delayed-onset symptoms covid-19 seems to have a longer incubation period than that of other acute respiratory viral infections such as human coronavirus 32 days influenza a 143164 days parainfluenza 26 days respiratory syncytial virus 44 days and rhinovirus 14 days 82 83 furthermore the median incubation period for sars has been estimated as 40 days in 2009 82 which is considerably lower than what we observed for covid-19 the longer incubation period of the covid-19 may be one of the major factors that helps explain its rapid spread in comparison with previous respiratory infection viruses other factors contributing to the spread of covid-19 are the lag between the onset of symptoms and first clinical visit ie 492 days and the high number of asymptomatic covid-19 patients these findings suggest that mers and sars patients may progress to severe symptoms and respiratory failures 84 much faster than most covid-19 patients 85 in comparison to mers with a fatality rate of 3567 86 and sars with a fatality rate of 11 87 we found covid-19 to have a much lower cfr 2 that significantly increased by age 56 increase for every 10-year increase although this estimate is comparable with previous studies 40 88 it is important to recognise the limitations of calculating fatality rates of covid-19 while the epidemic is still growing as most covid-19 patients remain asymptomatic and may recover without seeking medical care it is likely that the true cfr among people infected with sars-cov-2 could be even lower on the other hand the estimated fatality rates reported in most studies need to be interpreted with caution as they are often based on the cumulative number of deaths relative to the number of confirmed cases while patients who die on a given day have been infected at a much earlier date and this would bias the denominator used to calculate the fatality rate 89 we acknowledge four main limitations of our systematic review first our findings are mainly based on studies that recruited patient from clinics and hospitals and therefore may be biased towards more severe cases moreover our data might be skewed towards early reporting from provinces in china and outcomes might be different in other countries in the western context we are therefore aiming to update the review as more data become available in the next 12 months to provide more accurate estimates second many studies did not report the study outcomes by subgroups such as age or sex and we could not report group-specific outcomes third we used the mean and the standard error of the incubation period assuming a normal distribution which may have led to the underestimation of the right tail of the distribution lastly given the urgency of the topic and the heterogeneity of the studies included in the review we did not conduct the risk of bias or quality assessment of the studies given the emerging nature of covid-19 and the observational study design of most of the available evidence most studies in the review are at a high risk of bias and the quality of existing evidence is relatively low nonetheless our systematic review of literature provides an insightful picture of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 which could inform ongoing public health and public policy decision makings our findings of the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 provide important insight into healthcare systems prevention and planning efforts the incubation period ie 11 days in most studies and the lag between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis ie 5 days are longer for covid-19 compared to other respiratory viral infections including mers and sars current policies of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone potentially exposed to sars-cov-2 might be too conservative and longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases as effective vaccination or treatment for covid-19 are yet to be developed practising the fundamentals of public health and prevention science such as physical distancing and personal hygiene are critical and need to be emphasised and enforced further to reduce the risk of sars-cov-2 transmission  killing two birds with one stone green dead ends and ways out of the covid-19 crisis erik gawel paul lehmann   the expectation of huge amounts of public money being distributed at short notice brings interest groups of every shade to the scenepreferably with old wish lists on hand consequently there is a big risk that recovery programs will be captured by interest groups for an overview of the literature on regulatory capture see dal bo 2006 on the one hand climate change mitigation is put under pressure as being an extra burden for industries for example european car manufacturers have called for postponing the upcoming tightening of eu emission standards for car fleets topham and harvey 2020 some eu member states call for stalling the eu commissions plan of a european green deal simon 2020 on the other hand many recommend spending the public money mainly on measures that also help mitigating climate changeamong them frans timmermans executive vice-president of the european commission schulz 2020 or fatih birol head of the international energy agency birol 2020 there is one thing that must not be overlooked in this politico-economic competition public funds are still short and must be used reasonably otherwise ill-designed green subsidies can quickly turn into a part of the problem instead of being the solution previous cash for clunkers programs warn as an example of a misguided recovery measure these programs were introduced in many countries after the 2009 financial crisis and provided financial incentives to trade old less fuel-efficient cars for new more efficient ones empirical analyses have shown very mixed results regarding both the economic as well as the environmental stimulus effects of these measures grigolon et al 2016 li et al 2013 mian and sufi 2012 at the beginning of every discussion about green recovery programs it is therefore important to develop transparent and sensible criteria based on which public aid should be allocated after the initial bail-out programs public recovery programs to stabilize the economy are now debated politically certainly this generates an unprecedented window of opportunity for structural transformation moreover the distribution of public aid may also justify committing beneficiaries to public interests to a certain extent consequently the currently available political degrees of freedom should be used to promote the transition of society towards sustainability subsidies to branches like tourism aviation and agriculturewhich are particularly hit by the crisis and are lagging behind in terms of sustainabilityshould be paid conditional on meeting minimum environmental standards new investments into long-lived fossil-fueled assets must be avoided a recovery program cannot only be about re-establishing the status quo ante by assigning large public funds possibly creating new barriers for sustainability transitions in this respect it makes sense to implement recovery programs that are in line with the objective of mitigating climate changeas called for by many at the moment however such green recovery programs must not be arbitrary green recovery programs must go beyond green subsidies first of all it is also important to reduce unnecessary barriers for green investments for example by revising legal constraints to the expansion of renewable energies like solar photovoltaics of wind power moreover any green recovery program can only effectively and efficiently spur decarbonization if it combines with a carbon price and the abolition of environmentally harmful subsidies the direction of recovery must be crystal-clear otherwise green subsidies risk being ineffective and costly approaches to mitigating climate change kalkuhl et al 2013 palmer and burtraw 2005 while imposing additional burdens on public budgets and reducing political degrees of freedom in the future for subsidies to be economically justified they need to meet clear criteria for green recovery programs to succeed in the competition for public funds with other important policy fields such as health or digitalization they must help stabilize the economy moreover policy-makers need to be aware that some of the currently observed economic problems might even resolve without any government aid it can expected for example that global supply chains will resume and that people will catch up on purchasing durable goods like cars at least partly it is exactly the maintenance of environmental regulation that may help steer this consumption towards more sustainable modes government interventions must take effect where permanent disruptions are looming one example innovative green business models may particularly be at risk if banks limit loans in the presence of the current uncertainties lehmann and sderholm 2018 in this case government loans may provide direct assistance in contrast attempts to lower prices for goods and serviceseg for cars vat reduction purchase premiums or electricity reduction of energy leviesare rather inappropriate means to stabilize the economy such measures fail to address the actual sources of insufficient investments or reduced purchasing power and are therefore inefficient ways of spending public budgets furthermore it is unclear whether and to what extent such discounts will be passed through to final consumers by market prices peltzman 2000 green recovery programs should focus on government interventions that would also have been economically reasonable without the covid-19 crisisfor example to correct market failures next to the co2 externality bennear and stavins 2005 fischer and newell 2008 lehmann 2012and that have the highest priority for climate policy moreover those measures should be implemented for which rational concepts have been drafted already and that can be realized promptly positive examples of such no-regret measures can be found in the transport sector for instance this sector is severely lagging behind in terms of climate change mitigation and economic rationales for public expenditures exist at least partly briggs et al 2015 low and astle 2009 in addition to that numerous actors have already developed elaborated programs of measures those measures that can be implemented quickly should now be launchedfor instance to electrify the transport sector or to strengthen public transport green recovery programs must not only address the expenditure side a currently still disregarded issue is the question how the required billions of euro could be raised public expenditures for a green recovery program should at least partly be funded by polluters by implementing a carbon price and abandoning ecological harmful subsidies such policies internalizing environmental costs would not be an extra sacrificebut rather part of the solution both for revenue problems and for the redirection towards sustainability for a review of the double-divident hypothesis see goulder 2013 the coronavirus crisis has opened up a window of opportunity for transformation this should be used without getting off the regulatory track green recovery programs must not be reduced to a mere competition for green subsidies abandoning barriers to green investments and imposing a carbon price are equally important where economically sensible green subsidies should contribute both to stabilizing the economy and mitigating climate change moreover smart green recovery programs may contribute to raising revenues for the additionally necessary public expenditures

the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during covid-19 defining key cellular subsets and their states in covid-19 is a critical step in bringing critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism and new therapeutic strategy for covid-19 here we applied single-cell rna sequence scrna-seq to comprehensively characterize the changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ten of covid-19 patients our study depicts a highresolution transcriptome landscape of blood immune subsets in the recovery stage of covid-19 it reveals that compared to healthy controls hcs monocytes

highly expanded clone in recovery stage of covid-19 patients furthermore several specific bcr changes of covid-19 patients in recovery stage may be helpful for vaccine and antibody production to map the immune microenvironment of the covid-19 patients identify mirroring changes in blood and pinpoint cell-specific alterations associated with the severity of the disease we integrated singlecell rna

between covid-19 sars and mers such as the speed of transmission treatment scheme and mortality rate moreover the difference may also exist in the key immune players and the underlying molecular

respiratory syndrome coronavirus two sars-cov-2 the causative agent of novel coronavirus covid-19 or 2019-ncov has emerged in late 2019 which is believed to be originated from hubei province china called wuhan 16 25 2019-ncov or covid-19 is rapidly spreading in humans which is evidently believed that it was first derived from bats transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts probably the raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides and palm civet paguma larvata 8 18 21 the major symptoms of sars-cov-2 include fever cough and shortness of breath which in many instances appeared to be similar to that flu 16 covid-19 had since reached a decisive point and pandemic potential which claimed the lives of many people across the world and human-to-human transmission of covid-19 from infected individuals with mild symptoms have been reported 16 20 according to worldometers covid-19 pandemic affects 210 countries and territories around the world and 2 02 international conveyances with 6033875 confirmed cases 2661213 recovered cases and 366894 deaths as of may 30th 2020 0537 gmt 27 however there is no drug or vaccine clinically proven to treat covid-19 pandemic therefore other non-clinical or non-medical therapeutic techniques are urgently needed to contain and prevent further outbreak of covid-19 pandemic such as data mining techniques machine learning and expert system among other artificial intelligence techniques data mining dm is an advanced artificial intelligence ai technique that is used for discovering novel useful and valid hidden patterns or knowledge from dataset 6 14 the technique reveals relationships and knowledge or patterns among the dataset in several or single datasets 15 16 it has also widely used for the prognosis and diagnosis of many diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov that were so far discovered in 2003 and 2012 respectively 16 as huge dataset generated around the world related to 2019-ncov pandemic everyday is a treasured resource to be mined and analyzed for useful valid and novel knowledge or patterns extraction for better decision-making to contain the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic in healthcare sector data mining has been widely applied in many different applications such as predicting patient outcomes modeling health outcomes hospital ranking and evaluation of treatment effectiveness and infection control stability and recovery 1 23 29 in this study we developed several data mining models for the prediction of 2019-ncov-infected patients recovery the models predict when covid-19 infected patients would be recovered and released from isolation centers as well as patients that may likely not be recovered and lost their lives to covid-19 pandemic the models help the health workers to determine the recovery and stability of the newly infected persons with pandemic covid-19 the models are developed with the dataset obtained from korea centers for disease and prevention kcdc and dataset instances of the death and recovery records of the infected 2019-ncov pandemic were considered data mining algorithm which includes decision tree support vector machine naive bayes logistic regression random forest and k-nearest neighbor were applied directly on the dataset using python programming language to develop the models the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the overall methodology of the proposed system including data collection and preparation with data mining techniques the experimental results with detailed discussions are described in sect 3 lastly sect 4 concludes the paper the dataset was obtained from kcdc which was made available on kagge website 3 we used the epidemiological dataset of covid-19 patients of south korea the dataset has 3254 instances with 8 attributes which include patient id global number the number given by kcdc sex birth year age country province city disease true underlying diseasefalse no disease infection case infection order the order of infection infected by the id of who infected the patient contact number the number of contacts with people symptom onset date the date of symptom onset confirmed date the date of being confirmed released date the date of being released deceased date the date of being deceased and state state of the patients isolatedreleaseddeceased the dataset was prepared and cleaned where only relevant attributes were extracted from the original dataset the extracted dataset has only 1505 data instances with 5 attributes which include gender age infectioncase and nodays the number of days between the date the disease was confirmed and date the patients was released or die and state of the patients released or deceased we considered only two states of the patient which include released and deceased while isolation state was excluded table 1 revealed the data type of the attributes and table 2 showed the sample of some instances of the dataset the missing value in the dataset reduces the prediction power and produces biased estimates leading to an invalid conclusion 28 therefore we used last observation carried forward imputation technique to handle the missing values in the dataset figures 1 2 3 4 5 showed the frequency of each attribute of the dataset logistic regression lr is used to determine the association between categorical dependent variables against the independent variables 9 lr is used when the dependent variable has two values such as 0 and 1 yes and no or true and false and thus it is called binary logistic regression 22 however when the dependent variable has more than two values multinomial logistic regression is used a mathematical model of a set of explanatory variables for lr is used to predict a transformation of the dependent variables lr transformation is written mathematically as1documentclass12ptminimal

 many growth models have been very recently applied to study the evolution of the covid-19 infection3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 in 1 we tried to analyze the time evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy using a logistic model11 at the beginning of the study and after with a generalization of that model the logistic behaviour assumes that growth stops when maximum sustainable population density is reached through the carrying capacity k that depends on the environmental conditions for example the ordinances of the prime minister gconte the peoples hygiene habits are encoded in the carrying capacity k we observe as the generalized model of 1 works very well until the april 7 after this date the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked at first in italy pharyngeal swabs were initially made only on seriously ill people this choice gave us the possibility to have a sample of the infected that we can describe with a single population model after april 7 it becomes impossible so we decided to use a different model to describe the new trend of the data and try to give different scenarios of the descent phase of the virus in italy in the time window february 24-may 5 in 1 we described two different peaks the peak of the infected and the deaths one in this paper we analyze the peak of the currently infected and the downhill of the propagation of the sars-cov-2 to do this we define a new model similar to a sird see for example 7 but without the population of supsceptibles because there are no criteria on defining the susceptible ones we consider three couple differential equations for infected it deaths dt and recovery rt with the following conservation law1ptitrtdtwhere pt represents the currently infected or positive in the last part of this article we observe as the following ratio infected iti over swabs sti2inormtiitistiis the most important parameter to describe the evolution of the sars-cov-2 indeed we can describe the trend of this quantity only with a generalized logistic model with 4 parameters even with data after april 7 this behavior suggest us to use this model for a future epidemic of this virus if we will able to perform a greater and constant number of swabs everyday using this model we may have better control over the contagion curve and consequently over the number of deaths our idea is to use a model that adapts to the data of the problem we explain better lets consider the following data1 daily data of march 14 3497 new infected 11682 swabs2 daily data of april 17 3493 new infected 65705 swabs3 probable case fatality rate cfr of the virus is rougly 1   23 million of infected at april 17 with 172434 detected4 time delay between hospitalization and death td  4 days parameter extrapolated also in 15 time delay between the onset of symptoms and healing tr1442 days a very oscillating parameter6 two different lockdown ld data march 10 and march 22 with different restriction
 some comments about these data the points 1 and 2 describe perfectly that the sample of infected is not clean at the beginning of the contagion the swabs are performed only on the severe infected after 1 month the number of swabs are increased of a factor 6 and consequently also the midly infected are detected point 3 tells us that there is probably an incredible number of asymptomatics as a source of severe infected we have no control about it points 4 5 indicate that while the death data is under control the healed data are very oscillating in time finally the points 6 tells us that contribution of asymptomatics portrayed in 1 changes in time indeed from april 6-7 14-15 days after the second ld ie an incubation time the generalized logistic description fails after these considerations we have decided to couple the following equations3didtr0iattt0
4didtr0ir0ikatttt0tt0
5dddtkfdittddt
6drdtftdittrdtwith a conservation law7ptitrtdtwhere pt represents the currently infected or positive the parameters r
0 represents the rates of growth of epidemic k is the carrying capacity for the classical logistic model  is a constant in order to have a power low initial growth before ld  is the exponent of the second term of equation 1 that represents the influence of asymptomatic  a correction of the quadratic term of logistic and  are the constant parameters considering the influence of the government measures1
 kf is a proportionality constant between deaths and total number of infected while td and tr are the delays of deaths and recoveries respect to infected respectively the constant a represents the contribution of asymptomatic people as introduced in 1 and finally t
0 is the time of ld start a brief consideration about the function ft the great variability of tr suggest us that only the parameter tr is not sufficient to describe correctly the function rt so we decided to introduce a coefficient time dependent we present two different scenarios in fig 1
we consider a linear approximation ftabt while in fig 2
we consider a quadratic approximation ftabtct2 this choice is not random indeed considering the behaviour of the recovery time series in which a single recovery can heal with some delay in a window variable from few days to two months the correct modeling could be a regressive linear function of type rti1naiitti eventually introducing also no-linear term in the series but in this way we introduce many degree of freedom how many are the coefficient ai of the regressive function therefore we consider an approximation using the two functions ft considered above we desumed the following values for the principal parameters by means of 100 stochastic simulation using direct method gillespie algorithm adapted to non-autonomous differential equations8r0029002

 some comments about these values with respect to 1 we observe that the peak of the severe infected is correctly estimated ie t02426 march and also the peak of the deaths ie t02830 march also the time delay td remained the same the same tr approaches the experimental lower limit in quadratic approximation with respect to the logistic model r
0 is increased while the coefficient  drops from the value 2 to the value 184 ie we are considering different models in fig 1-2 we observe as the peak of currently infected is close to april 20 and finally we give us our prevision for a linear growth for the recoveries16iend247471dend35235close to july 10 for a quadratic growth we have17iend243766dend34682close to june 20 the estimated numbers iend and dend are very close but it is not surprising the eqs 3 and 4 for total infected head the model while ft is present in eq 6 that is only a proportionality equation obviously a linear approximation for ft leads to a slower recovery curve and therefore a small increase of infected we consider also the scenario represented by eq 19 for germany in fig 3 and for usa in fig 8

 a brief comment about these parameters the values r
0 are similar to each other and lower than the italian value with and without lombardia data this is completely coherent with the various scenarios the apparent lethality apparent cfr is approximately 45 in germany and 6 in the united states while in italy is 14 the contribution of asymptomatic a seems to be similar for all countries however the surprising result is that the trend of the virus is captured by the same differential equation ie eq 19 for all considered countries this could mean that the virus always has the same type of behavior but at different speed lets try to justify this idea a different speed may depend on population density work habits and the number of swabs at the beginning of the epidemic about the last consideration we imagine to immediately carry out a large number of swabs knowing as soon as possible the largest possible number of infected means limiting the contagion and therefore the propagation speed of virus we described the evolution of the sars-cov-2 in italy in the time window february 24-may 5 to do this we have built a phenomenological growth model adapted on the data of civil protection with respect to a classical sird model we did not consider the supsceptible population because there are not medical evidences on which sample of the population can be ill so we have considered three couple differential equations for infected it deaths dt and recovery rt with the a conservation law including the currently positive population pt as the time delay between the onset of symptoms and healing tr days is a very oscillating parameter we introduced a sort of regressive function ft to modelling better this delay so we described two scenarios of the end of epidemic
iend247471
dend35235 close to july 10 for ft linearly approximated
iend243766
dend34682 close to june 20 for ft in a quadratic approximation
 obviously a linear approximation for ft leads to a slower recovery curve and therefore a small increase of infected in the second part of this manuscript we described the time evolution of the normalized data45inormtiitistithat represents the number of infected normalized with the number of swabs sti we have studied this parameter on four different scenariositalydata of italy minus data of lombardia about 37 of the italian infected belong to the lombardia regionusagermany
 so we have found that all the evolutions are governed by the same generalized logistic equation 1 suggesting an universal feature of the propagation of sars-cov-2 virus in particular the value of the parameter r
0 is in descending order compatible with the respective apparent cfr acfrfor italy r00175 and acfr14
for italy-lombardia r00143 and acfr11
for usa r00082 and acfr6
germany r00069 and acfr45
 finally we suggest that the data i
normti is the most important parameter to control the propagation of the virus for a new inauspicious propagation of this virus in the world because knowing its universal feature we can forward know the number of infected preparing a relevant number of swabs

nutrition in covid-19 patients during and after hospitalization in intensive care unit francesco ferrara francesco de rosa antonio vitiello   a newly identified coronavirus sars-cov-2 in china in december 2019 resulted in a significant number of pneumonia resulting in deaths the spread as usual of these viruses is rapidly spreading all over the world with thousands of thousands of deaths it is no coincidence that the who has declared a state of pandemic for these reasons worldwide attention is concentrated in the fight against this virus the genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 is 795 of the identity with sars-cov the evidence that caused cov2 sars infection causes a generalized hyperinflammatory state due to the release of cytokines cytokine storm in literature it has been shown that the final stage of infection is the deadly one for humans in fact it is not the viral phase that kills but the strong activation of the immune system and the consequent release of cytokines the patient is thus supported and hospitalized in an intensive care unit icu hoping that he will overcome the famous storm and remain alive world scientific societies health professionals doctors researchers and scholars are intensifying research to find a suitable cure to fight the virus both to prevent infection and to treat the patient before he arrives at death the development of a vaccine will not be achieved in the short term many drugs are currently being tested to eradicate or at least reduce the lethality of the virus combinations of anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs appear to have shown good efficacy in inhibiting the release of cytokines thus preventing consequent lung collapse and also resulting in a drastic reduction in sars-cov-2-related mortality the spontaneous reflection is the possibility of resorting to clinical nutrition and amino acid supplementation both to prevent support and overcome the infectious phase with greater ease also in combination with pharmacological treatments this idea is reinforced by the fact that clinical nutrition and amino acids in addition to adequately nourishing the patient bedridden in icu can modulate the immune system to prevent infection and ensure that the inflammatory state is kept under control with less release of cytokines above all amino acids seem fundamental as an additional contribution in the patient suffering from covid and hospitalized in icu on the one hand it mitigates the release of cytokines and on the other it favors a prompt de-hospitalization in the healing phase for a prompt turn-over in the pandemic phase and with consequent savings of indirect and intangible costs 1 2 covid-19 disease leads to serious respiratory consequences such as pneumonia respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome ards sepsis and septic shock which in many cases leads to urgent hospitalization in intensive care ards is a severe hypoxic respiratory failure edema and risk of multi-organ dysfunction with invasive mechanical ventilation generally patients who have died from sars-cov-2 infection are older and have 3 or more comorbidities this is why covid-19 is the new -coronavirus which can lead to various pulmonary phenomena and death and represents a global health challenge medical nutrition therapy is among the pillars of therapeutic principles and a fundamental tool among global therapeutic measures for patients with covid-19 malnourished people with low immunity and chronic diseases have a worse higher prognosis and mortality rates the relevance of nutritional therapy is important and should be implemented as a first-line treatment and implemented in the anti-covid-19 clinical practice standard good nutrition not only provides the body with immunity to disease including covid-19 but it is also the main guarantee for the promotion of the recovery of the disease and the infected patient however the indications for nutritional therapy must be tailored nutritionists should pay attention to the most appropriate artificial nutrition an approach with enteral nutrition en or parenteral nutrition pn plan the method route and formula of nutritional therapy must be adapted dynamically and promptly in accordance with the clinical characteristics of the covid-19 patient the transition between ons en and pn should be fluid following the principle that when the en can satisfy 50 of the target demand the pn can be constantly reduced and carried out arrested when the ons can satisfy 50 of the target demand the en can be progressively reduced and therefore arrested 3 4 fig 1 old age and chronic diseases are related to frailty a situation that leads to reduced functional reserves and reduced resistance to stress thus there is weight loss malnutrition and acute hospitalization if you do not intervene with adequate nutritional support it can make an already compromised situation worse all patients hospitalized for more than 48 h regardless of the initial body mass index bmi and age are at risk of malnutrition and need adequate and timely nutrition prolonged hospitalization following catabolism and immobilization induces a reduction in weight and muscle mass which can cause sarcopenia a condition which in turn helps to reduce respiratory and cardiac function prolong the patients hospitalization and a worse prognosis in order to prevent malnutrition the actions done by the hospital are improving the patients response to therapy and facilitating healthcare professionals in the hospital nutrition management by reducing the already high workload due to the state of emergency most patients have severe inflammation and anorexia which leads to one drastic reduction of food intake which then leads to a respiratory failure treated with continuous positive airway pressure high-calorie diets must be readily provided oral integration of whey protein and intravenous infusion of multivitamin and multimineral solutions must be implemented at the time of admission if respiratory conditions worsen total parenteral nutrition should be considered to cope with the current emergency crisis nutritional assistance must be implemented promptly and pragmatically in patients with covid-19 because it could be neglected although it is necessary for the benefit of clinical and effective results in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population 5 6 fig 2 it is possible to follow simple patterns of conduct in the critical patient in the intensive care with respiratory failure for over 48 h en medical nutritional therapy must be started with priority pn nutrition has been started for more than 3 days after en strategies have failed to avoid severe malnutrition overeating should always be avoided and a gradual approach is best the nutritional requirement in covid-19 must provide more energy than normal nutrition maintaining the energy balance of patients with covid-19 is fundamental however considering the increased metabolic load in patients with severe pneumonia moderately low calories can reduce the metabolic load and excessive energy intake is a risk factor to reduce the catabolism due to inflammatory mediators it is indicated to increase protein intake as a top priority the supply of amino acids helps prevent muscle loss and improve the strength of the respiratory muscles given the importance of clinical ethical and economic action aimed at reducing infections including those from covid-19 studies have always been carried out which demonstrate how the correct supply of nutrients can improve the prognosis and pathological course in icus the use of amino acids undoubtedly improves the clinical course and favors the prompt physiological recovery after a period of hospitalization then in the case of the covid patient admitted to icu with a strong inflammatory state it is shown how the adequate nutritional support of glutamine probiotics and lactoferrin helps to reduce the pro-inflammatory molecules il-1 il-6 responsible for the fatal event pulmonary coronavirus alterations in muscle protein turnover if the patient remains hospitalized for a long time could lead to physical disability hypercatabolic activity if integrated with amino acids could limit muscle hypercatabatabism mh 7 8 inflammation and changes in amino acid metabolism are related to covid-19 and affect the skeletal muscles therefore probably rehabilitation requires personalized approaches in addition amino acids are essential nutrients for infectious microorganisms and the levels of some amino acids such as tryptophan decrease in response to infection andor inflammation and for this reason they should be restored so as not to experience severe malnutrition some nutrients including amino acids have been shown to have a remarkable amount of influence on immune function immunonutrients and improvement of metabolic and nutritional indices such as nitrogen balance and serum proteins immunonutrients can promote patient recovery by inhibiting inflammatory responses and regulating immune function glutamine which can modulate and preserve intestinal and lung function is compromised in conditions of severe stress reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 9 10 cytokine-mediated effects are an essential part response to infection but excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines increases the risk of pneumonia and death in covid-19 patients the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines th1 cytokines eg tumor necrosis factor- tnf- il-1 il-6 interferon- ifn- in coronavirus pneumonia is overexpressed in a storm chronic inflammation occurs when the triggering factors persist or there is some sort of resolution failure processes inflammation plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of covid-19 an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines leading to the cytokine storm is currently considered to contribute to the development and progression of covid-19 many authors have shown that amino acids have anti-inflammatory effects and the integration of arginine glutamine or glycine improves lung damage induced by infections or any other inflammatory event thus contributing to alveolar improvement in its integrity and function in particular the administration of glutamine has been shown to significantly reduce inflammatory cytokines without affecting other parameters 11 12 arginine or glycine supplementation may be a new nutritional strategy to reduce the deleterious effects of bacterial infection on alveolar function proinflammatory cytokines tnf il-1 and il-6 and chemotactic cytokines cxcl-1 mcp-1 and icam-1 induce apoptosis in the alveoli and cause a severe inflammatory state the use of amino acids reduced the mrna levels for tnf il-1 and il-6 and reduced inflammation il-6 regulates the accumulation of neutrophils and therefore contributes to lung damage the administration of arginine or glycine leads to a reduction in the expression of il-6 and cxcl-1 with less neutrophils in the alveolar epithelium so as to have a regulatory effect on the lung arginine or glycine has a regulatory function as adjuvant nutrients in clinical therapy the molecular mechanisms underlying this important modulating effect of arginine glycine and glutamine are still to be clarified glutamine inhibits the accumulation of immune cells and arginine glycine or glutamine have inhibited cell apoptosis in various studies but the metabolism of amino acids and their metabolites differ from each other in the alveoli thus leading to different responses furthermore it should be added that malnutrition easily leads to a decrease in the lean body mass and can cause sarcopenia a frequently encountered disease in the elderly with aggravation of geriatric pathologies current opinions consider malnutrition and possible sarcopenia as a consequence of multiple medical behavioral and environmental factors involving the nervous hormonal nutritional system substitution of muscle proteins proinflammatory conditions and the load of reactive oxygen species inside the mitochondria with the intake of amino acids there is a better functional recovery of the muscles and a significant reduction in serum cancer necrosis factor tnf and a significant increase in both insulin-like growth factors without having significant adverse effects these preliminary data indicate that dietary supplements with the oral amino acid mixture have significantly increased lean body mass in elderly subjects with and without sarcopenia 13 14 the suggestions for proper evidence-based nutritional therapy reported here are for patients with critical covid-19 conditions and should be included in life-saving therapies the supplementation of amino acids and lactoferrin should always be accompanied by drug therapies following an icu hospitalization and its importance cannot be overlooked malnutrition phenomena weaken the patient already in poor condition and greatly lengthen recovery and recovery times furthermore the lung damage caused by coronavirus is caused by an overexpression of proinflammatory molecules cytokines which from literature data has been shown to be lowered by an adequate integration of amino acids nutritional therapy together with pharmacological therapy undoubtedly helps the covid patient to overcome the acute phase of the disease first and to shorten recovery times  did the lockdown curb the spread of covid-19 infection rate in india a data-driven analysis dipankar mondal siddhartha chakrabarty p  in order to analyze the effectiveness of three successive nationwide lockdown enforced in india we present a data-driven analysis of four key parameters reducing the transmission rate restraining the growth rate flattening the epidemic curve and improving the health care system these were quantified by the consideration of four different metrics namely reproduction rate growth rate doubling time and death to recovery ratio the incidence data of the covid-19 during the period of 2nd march 2020 to 31st may 2020 outbreak in india was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve making use of the exponential growth the maximum likelihood estimation sequential bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction the best fit based on the data considered was for the time-dependent approach accordingly this approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate the period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3 saw a 45 reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate during the same period the growth rate reduced from 393 during the pre-lockdown to 33 after lockdown 3 accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form 4-6 days to 12-14 days finally the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from 028 pre-lockdown to 008 after lockdown 3 in conclusion all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown exhibited significant favourable changes from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3 analysis of the data in the post-lockdown period with these metrics will provide greater clarity with regards to the extent of the success of the lockdown  as of 5th june 2020 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 with its epicenter in wuhan china 1  has resulted in more than 65 million confirmed cases and 3 87 155 causalities 2  the global pandemic resulting from covid-19 was preceded by two other outbreaks of human coronavirus in the 21st century itself namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections 3  the possibilities of the source of the transmission of covid-19 outbreak includes but is not limited to animals human-to-human and intermediate animal-vectors 3  the index case for covid-19 outbreak in india was reported on 30th january 2020 in case of an individual with a travel history from wuhan china 4  the data available on 4  suggests that during the early stages the covid-19 positive cases in india were limited to individuals with a travel history involving the global hotspots of the outbreak however subsequently cases were detected in individuals who neither had a travel history involving the global hotspots nor had any contact with individuals who were already infected which indicated the possibility of community outbreak this resulted in the government of india announcing a lockdown across the country driven by the necessity of ensuring that the social distancing norms are strictly observed while the lockdown was not the only response to the pandemic it was a very crucial step towards curbing the growth of covid-19 in densely populated countries like india given the concurrent economic cost of the lockdown it is even more critical from the epidemiological as well as economic perspective to assess its effectiveness this paper presents a datadriven analysis to examine the effectiveness of the lockdown with an emphasis on the question as to whether the lockdown succeeded in curbing the intensity of covid-19 spread rate in india  in order to answer this we empirically analyze four different metrics namely reproduction number growth rate doubling time and death to recovery ratio which quantify the transmission rate the growth rate the curvature of epidemic curve and the improvement of health care capacity respectively we now give a brief summary of some of the available literature on quantitative approaches to the modeling of transmission of covid-19 outbreak a system of ordinary differential equation ode driven model for phasic transmission of covid-19 was analyzed for calculating the transmissibility of the virus in 5  kucharski et al 1 considered a stochastic transmission model on the data for cases in wuhan china including cases that originated there to estimate the likelihood of the outbreak taking place in other geographical locations a literature survey by liu et al 6  summarized that the reproductive number and hence the infectivity in case of covid-19 exceeded that of sars a monte-carlo simulation approach to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic in india was carried out in 7  in carrying out the mathematical and statistical modeling of covid-19 it would be helpful to refer to the quantitative models analyzed in case of the two preceding outbreaks of human coronavirus namely sars and mers in 8  a network model was analyzed to identify localized hotbeds as well as super-spreaders for sars constrained by somewhat limited availability of data a simple compartment model was used in 9  for in-silico predictive analysis of sars outbreak in beijing china yan and zou 10  determined the optimal and sub-optimal strategies for quarantine and isolation in case of sars a predictive model in 11  on imported cases of mers was used to ascertain the likelihood of a mers diagnosis during the time window between immigration and onset of the disease the trajectory of mers outbreak was calibrated to a dynamic model in 12  with the goal of studying the role of time in implementing the control measures a key identifier for the transmissibility of epidemiological diseases such as covid-19 is the basic reproduction number r 0  which is defined as the average number of secondary infections resulting from an infected case in a population whose all members are susceptible accordingly we seek to estimate the data-driven value of r 0  for the outbreak of covid-19 in india further we also seek to determine the time-dependent reproduction number r t  for better clarity on the time-variability of the reproduction number particularly in the paradigm of its dynamics during the phases of the nationwide lockdown in india in addition we also estimate and analyze the statistical performance of growth rate doubling time and death to recovery ratio the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we detail the source of the data as well as the statistical approaches used for the estimation of r 0 and r t  this will be followed by the discussion of the results for the outbreak in india in section 3 in section 4 we present the data driven analysis of the impact of the lockdown and finally in the concluding remarks in section 5 we highlight the main takeaways for this analysis the data of incidences used for the analysis reported in this paper was obtained from the website of india covid 19 tracker 4  and used for the purpose of estimation of r 0  this estimation was carried out making use of the r0 package 13 of the statistical package r the standardized approach included in the r0 package includes the implementation of the exponential growth eg maximum likelihood ml estimation sequential bayesian sb method and estimation of time dependent reproduction td numbers used during the h1n1 pandemic of 2009 the package is designed for the estimation of both the initial reproduction number as well as the time-dependent reproduction number accordingly we present a brief summary of the four approaches used in the paper 1 exponential growth eg as observed in 14  the reproduction number can be indirectly estimated from the rate of the exponential growth in order to address the disparity in the different differential equation models the authors observe that this disparity can be attributed to the assumptions made about the shape of the generation interval distribution accordingly the choice of the model used for the estimation of the reproduction number is driven by the shape of the generation interval distribution based on the assumption that the mean is equal to he generation intervals the authors obtain the important result of determining an upper bound on the possible range of values of the reproduction number for an observed rate of exponential growth which manifests into the worst case scenario for the reproductive number let the function ga be representative of the generation interval distribution if the moment generating function m z of ga is given by m z   0 e za gada then the reproduction number is given by exists in particular the poisson distribution can be used in the analysis of the integer valued incidence data 15 16  for discretized generation time distribution an important caveat is that this approach is applicable to the time window in which the incidence data is observed to be exponential 13  2 maximum likelihood ml estimation the maximum likelihood model as proposed in 17 is based on the availability of incidence data n 0  n 1      n t  with the notation n t  t  0 1 2     t denoting the count of new cases at time t in practice we take the index t in days while noting that this indexing is applicable for other lengths of time intervals this approach is driven by the assumption that the poisson distribution models the number of secondary infections from an index case with the average providing the estimate for the basic reproduction number if we denote the number of observed incidences for consecutive time intervals by n 1  n 2      n t and let p i denote the probability of the serial interval of a case in i days which can be estimated apriori then the likelihood function is the thinned poisson n ti p i and p  p 1  p 2      p k  the absence of data from the index case can lead to an overestimation of the initial reproduction number and accordingly a correction needs to be implemented 13  3 sequential bayesian sb method a sir model driven sequential estimation of the initial reproduction number was carried out by the sequential bayesian method in 18  it is based on the poisson distribution driven estimate of incidence n t1 at time t  1 with the mean of n t e r1  in particular the probability distribution for the reproduction number r based on the observed temporal data is given is the prior distribution of r and p n 1  n 1      n t1  is independent of r the td method is amenable to the computation of the reproduction numbers through the averaging over all networks of transmission based on the observed data 19  let i and j be two cases with the respective times of onset of symptoms being t i and t j  further let p ij denote the probability of i being infected by j if ga denotes the distribution of the generation interval  accordingly the effective reproduction number is given by r j  i p ij  whose average is then given by r t  1 n t t j t r j  in absence of observed secondary cases a correction can be made to the time dependent estimation 20 3 estimating the reproduction numbers and fitting the epidemic curve in this section we undertake the fitting of the epidemic curve and the estimation of the reproduction numbers using the approaches enumerated in section 2 we have obtained the daily incidence data for the period of 2nd march 2020 to 31st may 2020 4  the epidemic curve based on the data for this period is depicted in figure 1  which indicates that the number of covid-19 positive cases were growing in an almost exponential manner the initial reproduction number r 0 according to the eg is for the estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers or the effective reproduction numbers r t  the generation time distribution is required accordingly we use gamma distribution with mean of 52 days and the standard deviation of 28 days as reported from china 21  now the average r t  using the sb and td methods are 1591 and 168 respectively the r 0 values using eg and ml and the r t values using sb and td along with the corresponding 95 confidence intervals are tabulated in table 1  further the seven-day rolling r t  obtained for the cases of sb and td are plotted in figure 2 and besides estimating the reproduction rate we fit the epidemic curve making use of the four models namely eg ml sb and td accordingly the predicted incidence based on the fitted model parameters in each case and the observed incidence for each method are illustrated in figure 4  the prediction provided by the eg ml and td are reasonably close to the actual cases however it is clearly observed that the most poorly fitted model is the sb model the sb model overestimates the epidemic curve and thus the predictions according to this model are much higher than the actual incidences therefore in order to find the best-fitted model the root mean squared errors rm se  n i1  i  y i  2 n  for all the models were calculated as expected the rmse for the sb model is the highest on the other hand the td model has the lowest rmse the rmse values for all the four models are tabulated in table 2  from where we can conclude based on the data set considered that the best model for the estimation of the covid-19 epidemic in india is the td model  the nationwide lockdown was imposed on 25th march 2020 with the goal of arresting the spread of infection through strict restrictions on mass movement and encouraging social distancing and it was expected that the spread rate would come down along with the reduction in the possibility of community transmission this in turn would result in curbing the number of cases from rising dramatically thereby enabling the healthcare system with more time to make necessary arrangements for the better preparedness of the medical infrastructure thus the first phase of lockdown until 14th april 2020 was extended to another two phases of lockdown with slightly relaxed restrictions and were enforced from 15th april to 3rd may 2020 and from 4th may to 31st may 2020 this section discusses the impact of the entire lockdown on covid-19 spread by analyzing various metrics namely the effective reproduction rate the growth rate the doubling time and the death to recovery ratio one of the key mathematical indicator relied upon in the paradigm of the spread of covid-19 pandemic and consequent policy decisions is the effective reproduction rate err or the time-varying reproduction number as err provides the information of time varying transmission rate it would be a natural choice to measure the impact of the entire lockdown as well as different phases of the lockdown in the preceding section 3 we have shown that amongst all the models the td is the best fitted model for the indian epidemic curve hence we discuss the impact of lock-down in the context of the td-based r t  b average seven-day r t figure 5  impact of lockdown on err figure 5a depicts the seven-day rolling err it is clearly observed that before the lockdown the r t was unsteady but it started dipping downward after the commencement of the lockdown in the pre-lockdown period the average seven-day err was 223 therefore before the lockdown if 100 individuals had covid-19 they would have infected 223 people on an average in the first lock-down period the average err came down to 173 a 22 drop thus at this rate 100 carriers would infect 173 others on an average in the second and third lockdown periods the err furthers dipped to 131 and 122 respectively therefore from the pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3 the overall rate of reduction of err was nearly 45 figure 5b displays the phase-wise 1 average r t  the descriptive statistics of r t and the corresponding confidence intervals are described in table  3  from these results we can clearly infer that so far the lockdown has by and large succeeded in reducing the err however this observation come with the caveat that the three successive lockdowns did not drive the r t below 1 which is suggestive that the epidemic may exhibit a surge once all the restrictions are lifted 42 impact on growth rate the reduction of err should further reduce the growth rate of daily incidences in order to see the growth rate in a particular time period we calculate the seven-day rolling growth rate in that period and then take the average suppose that we have daily incidence numbers dt t  1 2 3     20 for a period of 20 days we first compute the seven-day rolling growth rates  where i  1 2 3     13 and we get a dataset of 13 points finally the simple mean of the dataset is calculated if the seven-day average growth is 30 in a month then the average weekly number of positive cases would have increased from 100 to 130 in that month  growth rate  figure 6  weekly growth rate of positive cases figure 6 illustrates the average weekly growth rate in different time periods in the pre-lockdown period l0 the growth rate was 393 it means that the weekly number of positive cases increased drastically from 100 to 493 in the pre-lockdown period the growth rate has decreased to 191 in lockdown 1 l1 it further reduced to 47 and 32 in lockdown 2 l2 and lockdown 3 l3 respectively therefore we can conclude that the implementation of nationwide lockdown has resulted in slowing down the growth rate of covid-19 positive cases one of the key indicator to see the spread of any pandemic is the doubling time it is referred to as the time usually counted in number of days it takes for the total number of cases to double the doubling time of n days means that if there were 100 cases at day 0 then on day n the number of cases would be 200 the more the doubling time is the more the possibility of achieving a flattened epidemic curve figure 7b  the increment in doubling time is clearly visible from this figure therefore from these results we infer that the doubling time has improved significantly after the enforcement of nationwide lockdown in a pandemic the performance of any nations health care system is measured ultimately in terms of deaths and recoveries this segment discuses the effect of lockdown on death to recovery ratio dtr the dtr is defined as a ratio between total number of deaths and total number of recoveries total number of deaths upto time t total number of recoveries upto time t  the dtr stipulates the clinical management ability or the efficiency of health system it is highly important to keep the value of the dtr as low as possible mathematically the closer this value is to zero the better the efficiency of healthcare system in dealing with the pandemic for example dt r t  05 implies that for every 100 recoveries 50 infected patients would have died the seven-day rolling dtr is plotted in figure 8a  it is clearly seen that the dtr has declined significantly as time has progressed the phase-wise bar chart also depicts the reduction of dtr over the period of three months in pre-lockdown l0 and lockdown 1 l1 periods together the average dtr was 028 it reduced to 014 in lockdown 2 l2 and further declined to 008 in lockdown 3 l3 which shows that in this short period the indian health care system has been improved significantly to tackle the covid-19 pandemic figure 8  impact of lockdown on death to recovery ratio 5 conclusion in this paper we have discussed the impact of lockdown on covid-19 infection rate in india the aim was to see whether the lockdown has really curbed intensity of spread in order to do that we empirically analyzed different metrics that mainly measure the spread of infectious disease like covid-19 the metrics are effective reproduction rate growth rate doubling time and death to recovery ratio dtr for case of err it is seen that the lockdown has reduced the reproduction rate by more than 40 the growth rate has also substantially decreased from the initial period to the end of lockdown on the other hand the doubling time has largely improved over the three month period the rate of increment from pre-lockdown to lockdown 3 is nearly 183 finally we described the impact on dtr which quantifies the number of death against the number of recoveries we observed significant downfall of dtr from the month of april on average the initial dtr of 028 has dipped downward to 008 at the third phase of lockdown therefore despite rising cases of covid-19 infection in india the lockdown has managed to curb the spread to some extent however the caveat is that despite the encouraging results the pandemic will persist unless the err is driven below 1 it remains to be seen if there is a adverse movement of the metrics after the relaxation of the restrictions the behaviour of these metrics in post-lockdown period will provide a more accurate and complete information regarding the success or failure of lockdown  prevalence and duration of acute loss of smell or taste in covid-19 patients yonghyun lee pokkee min seonggu lee shin-woo kim   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a pandemic infectious disease threatening the world in daegu korea the outbreak started on february 18 2020 and peaked on february 29 2020 with 741 new cases confirmed in a day1 in korea the method used for the diagnosis of all cases of covid-19 was real-time polymerase chain reaction with an explosive increase in the number of new patients hospital bed shortage was a great challenge to the healthcare system1 we developed and employed a remote telephone severity scoring system daegu severity score for covid-19 for assigning priority for hospitalization and arranging for facility isolation therapeutic living centers starting on february 29 20201 fifteen centers were operated for the 3033 admissions to covid-19 therapeutic living centers1 approximately 150 physicians of the daegu medical association dma voluntarily participated in this study and checked the status of patients who were staying at home on a daily basis1 they reported the interview results to the team arranging hospitalization or facility isolation in daegu during the interviews several dma physicians found that a significant number of the patients stated experiencing acute loss of smell anosmia or loss of taste ageusia acute smell and taste disorders are related to a wide range of respiratory viral infections23 covid-19 is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations4 in a typical case a high fever appears after dry cough in some cases viral pneumonia develops and progresses resulting in shortness of breath45 common symptoms among patients with covid-19 include fever dry cough shortness of breath dyspnea muscle ache myalgia confusion headache sore throat rhinorrhea chest pain diarrhea nauseavomiting conjunctival congestion nasal congestion sputum production fatigue malaise hemoptysis and chills46789 a literature review revealed a few published articles on the importance of anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of covid-1910111213 from march 8 2020 dma physicians prospectively questioned patients newly diagnosed with covid-19 who were awaiting hospitalization or facility isolation regarding the presence of anosmia or ageusia they also provided counseling on a daily basis for these symptoms until admission to hospitals or therapeutic living centers the data collected on anosmia or ageusia during the telephone severity scoring performed from march 8 2020 to march 31 2020 were analyzed retrospectively for the evaluation of the diagnostic significance of anosmia or ageusia in covid-19 additional telephone calls were made after admission to assess the duration of symptom persistence among those who reported that anosmia or ageusia persisted until hospitalization or facility isolation we analyzed the collected data using descriptive statistics and kaplan-meier analysis for the evaluation of factors associated with the recovery from anosmia or ageusia statistical analyses were performed using r statistics version 35 approximately 15 153 4883191 patients had anosmia or ageusia in the early stage of covid-19 fig 1 among patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity 2342 patients 367 157 had anosmia or ageusia the basic characteristics of the patients with or without anosmia or ageusia are summarized in table 1 anosmia or ageusia was significantly more common among females and younger individuals p  001 and p  0001 respectively table 1 the duration of these two symptoms was ascertained based on the daily interviews conducted by dma physicians during the waiting period for hospitalization or facility isolation and by follow-up telephone interviews with 232 for anosmia and 196 for ageusia patients recovery from anosmia is expressed using a survival curve fig 2a kaplan-meier graphs with log-rank tests were generated using data on recovery from anomia based on demographic variables including age of  50 years and sex no significant differences were observed in log-rank tests the median time to recovery from anosmia was 7 days and the recovery time pattern is depicted in fig 2b the median time to recovery from ageusia was 7 days and the recovery time pattern is shown in fig 2c most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks fig 2b and c young age particularly the age group of 2039 years showed a tendency to be associated with a longer persistence of anosmia fig 2d recovery from ageusia was similar to that from anomia supplementary fig 1 recently anosmia was reported in a small cross-sectional survey study of covid-1911 this article did not report follow-up information and included a relatively small number of patients 59 patients our data were derived from 3191 patients among whom 232 anosmia and 143 ageusia were followed up regarding the persistence of these symptoms smell and taste disorders are related to a wide range of viral infections23 infection of the upper respiratory tract can cause acute-onset anosmia or ageusia because of viral damage to the olfactory epithelium3 moreover viruses that can use the olfactory nerve as a route into the central nervous system include influenza a virus herpesviruses poliovirus rabies virus parainfluenza virus adenoviruses and japanese encephalitis virus2 in mouse models sars-cov demonstrated transneuronal penetration through the olfactory bulb and its infection resulted in the rapid transneuronal spread of the virus to connected areas of the brain14 in covid-19 headache may not only be a constitutional symptom but also be a symptom induced by invasion of the central nervous system human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov-21012 damage to the olfactory nerve during invasion and multiplication of sars-cov-2 may explain anosmia observed in the early stage of covid-19 therefore anosmia or ageusia may be more frequently observed in the covid-19 patients than other respiratory viral infections ageusia may be a secondary result of olfactory dysfunction however the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor which is the main host cell receptor of sars-cov-2 for binding and penetrating cells is widely expressed on epithelial cells of the oral mucosa15 damage of mucosal epithelial cells of the oral cavity may explain ageusia observed in the early stage of covid-19 this evidence may explain the pathogenetic mechanism underlying anosmia and ageusia in covid-19 high transmissibility of covid-19 before and immediately after symptom onset was reported with a recent epidemic study16 early diagnosis is important for the control of covid-19 recognition of early signs such as anosmia or ageusia might be very helpful for the diagnosis covid-19 and isolation of the patients this telephone severity scoring system had a limitation regarding the accuracy of the assessment of patients however anosmia and ageusia are not ambiguous symptoms our report had a relatively large number of patients and focused on the time pattern on the recovery of these symptoms in conclusion anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of covid-19 particularly in the early stage of the disease the acute anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized as important symptoms of the covid-19 infection among patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity the presence of anosmia or ageusia may be an important differential presentation for the suspicion and diagnosis of covid-19 and these symptoms may recover within 3 weeks  immune cell profiling of covid-19 patients in the recovery stage by single-cell sequencing wen wen wenru su hao tang wenqing le

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread in many countries13 as of april 6 2020 sars-cov-2 has affected over 1200000 people and killed more than 60000 of those affected in more than 160 countries following its global spread the world health organization declared it a public health emergency of international concern4 covid-19 shows symptoms of fever dry cough fatigue diarrhea conjunctivitis and pneumonia some patients develop severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or multiple organ failure57 although scientists and clinicians worldwide have made great efforts to produce vaccines and explored antiviral drugs89 there is still no specific medicine and highly effective clinical treatment for covid-191011 immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm have been observed and are believed to be associated with the severity of pathogenic coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections1213 with regard to covid-19 recent studies also found decreases in lymphocyte numbers and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine levels in peripheral blood514 however the manner in which key immune cell subsets change and their states during covid-19 have remained largely unclear thus defining these key cellular subsets and their states in covid-19 is a crucial step in obtaining critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism and developing new therapeutic strategies for covid-19 here we applied single-cell rna sequencing scrna-seq to comprehensively characterize the changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from 10 covid-19 patients our study depicted a high-resolution transcriptome landscape of blood immune cell subsets during the recovery stage of covid-19 it revealed that compared to that in the healthy controls hcs monocytes containing high inflammatory gene expression and il1 subsets predominated whereas cd4 t cells decreased remarkably in patients in the early recovery stage of covid-19 we found that t and b cell clones were highly expanded during the recovery stage in covid-19 patients furthermore several specific bcr changes in covid-19 patients during the recovery stage may be helpful for vaccine and antibody production to map the immune microenvironment of covid-19 patients we identified mirroring changes in the blood and pinpointed cell-specific alterations associated with disease severity and recovery we then integrated scrna-seq single-cell paired bcr and single-cell paired tcr analysis from a total of 10 covid-19 patients in the early recovery stage ers or late recovery stage lrs 70858 pbmcs we also collected scrna-seq data

we analyzed the distribution of the three immune cell lineages myeloid nk and t and b cells based on the expression of canonical lineage markers and other genes specifically upregulated in each cluster fig 1b c for marker genes expression values in each cell positioned in a t-sne are shown in fig 1d we next clustered the cells of each lineage separately and identified a total of 20 immune cell clusters the immune cell compartment of patients who have recovered from covid-19 infection comprised all major immune lineages we analyzed 128096 scrna-seq profiles that passed quality control including 36442 myeloid cells 64247 nk and t cells and 10177 b cells from five hcs five ers and five lrs patients the sketchy clustering analysis landscape of each subject is presented in supplementary fig s2a and the merged image of each group is shown in fig 2a we discovered that covid-19 patients including ers and lrs demonstrated a higher proportion of myeloid cells compared to the hcs but with a lower proportion of nk and t cells fig 2b c interestingly lrs patients had more b cells and nk and t cells but less myeloid cells than the ers patients fig 2b c thus these findings indicated that covid-19 patients had decreased lymphocyte counts and increased counts of myeloid cells in peripheral blood to further understand the changes in the myeloid nk and t and b cells in covid-19 patients we conducted differential expression gene deg analysis of the nk and t b and myeloid cells between the hcs and patients the heatmaps are shown in fig 2df inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as il1b ccl3 irf1 dusp1 jun and fos were all expressed at high levels in patients regardless of myeloid cells fig 2d nk and t cells fig 2e or b cells fig 2f collectively our results demonstrated that myeloid cells increased whereas nk and t cells decreased in the peripheral blood of covid-19 patients and that the immune cell compositions differed between the patients in the ers and lrs to further understand the changes in the monocytes in patients in the early and late recovery stages of covid-19 we conducted gene expression analysis and sub-clustered the myeloid cells into six transcriptionally distinct subsets using uniform manifold approximation and projection umap classical cd14 monocytes m1 non-classical cd16 fcgr3a cd14 monocytes m2 intermediate cd14 cd16 monocytes m3 cd1c cdc2 m4 clec9a cdc1 m5 and pdc clec4ccd123 m6 were present in the six distinct clusters fig 3a b we found that the compartment of the monocyte subset differed remarkably among the hcs and covid-19 patients fig 3c among the myeloid cells the ratio of classical cd14 monocytes m1 higher in the ers patients than in the hcs and was almost normal in the lrs patients fig 3c we found that covid-19 patients had a greater abundance of cd14 il1 monocytes and ifn-activated monocytes than the hcs fig 3df genes associated with cd14 inflammatory monocytes m1 had high expression levels of inflammatory genes such as il1 jun fos junb and klf6 chemokines ccl4 cxcr4 and interferon-stimulated genes ifrd1 irf1 and ifi6 in contrast anti-inflammatory genes associated with cd14 monocytes m1 were downregulated in covid-19 patients relative to that in the hcs fig 3d e notably il1 expression values in a umap with simultaneous contrast indicated that il1 was upregulated in the ers group and decreased in the lrs patients fig 3f this was also confirmed in the dc cluster of the ers group compared to that of the hcs supplementary fig s3a b next we took the average of the inflammatory genes for each myeloid cell scrna-seq subset in the covid-19 patients versus that in the hcs supplementary fig s3c these results demonstrated that cytokine activation drives the expansion of monocyte populations especially cd14 inflammatory monocytes in covid-19-infected patients to explore the biological significance of the transcriptional changes in the m1 cluster we performed go analysis with degs fig 3g we observed enrichment of the pathways related to cytokine signaling and inflammation activation which were driven by the upregulation of ifitm3 and ifi6 and il1 jun fos junb and klf6 fig 3g collectively these findings demonstrate that a dysregulated balance in the monocyte populations in ers patients is manifested by substantially increased classical cd14 monocytes our results suggest that the classical cd14 monocytes increase in circulation to fuel inflammation during sars-cov-2-infection t and nk cells play critical roles in viral clearance during respiratory infections1516 our clustering analysis sub-grouped t and nk lymphocytes into 10 subsets fig 4a based on canonical markers fig 4b and supplementary fig s4a nk cells highly expressed ncam1 klrf1 klrc1 and klrd1 then we sub-divided the nk cells into cd56cd16 nk cells nk1 which expressed high levels of cd56 and low levels of cd16 and c56cd16 nk cells nk2 which expressed high levels of cd16 and low levels of cd56 cd4 t cells expressed cd3e and cd4 then we sub-divided these cells into four clusters nave cd4 t cells t1 which expressed high levels of ccr7 lef1 and tcf7 central memory cd4 t cells t2 cd4 tcm which expressed high levels of ccr7 but more aqp3 and cd69 compared to nave cd4 t cells effector memory cd4 t cells t3 cd4 tem which expressed high levels of ccr6 cxcr6 ccl5 and prdm1 and regulatory t cells t4 treg which expressed foxp3 cd8 t cells expressed cd8a and cd8b and were sub-divided into three clusters nave cd8 t cells t5 which expressed high levels of ccr7 lef1 and tcf7 similar to nave cd4 t cells effector memory cd8t cells t6 cd8 tm which expressed high levels of gzmk and cytotoxic cd8 lymphocytes cd8 ctl t7 which expressed high levels of gzmb gnly and prf1 proliferating t cells t8 tprol were tyms
mki67 cells the composition of the t and nk cell subsets differed significantly among the hcs and covid-19 patients fig 4c the absolute number of cd8t cells especially the effector memory cd8 t cell subgroup and nk cells decreased in covid-19 patients whereas the relative ratio of nk cells in ers was higher than that in the hcs the ratio of cd4 t cells was stable but the composition of the cd4 t cell subset differed significantly between the hcs and covid-19 patients among cd4 t cells the ratio of central memory cd4 t cells was significantly higher whereas the ratio of nave cd4 t cells tregs and effector memory cd4 t cell was lower than that in the hcs especially in ers group notably genes associated with cd4 t cells had relatively high expression levels of inflammation-related genes and were significantly upregulated in the covid-19 patients fig 4d cd4 t cells had high expression levels of inflammatory genes including fos jun klf6 and s100a8 in patients in the ers of covid-19 fig 4e in contrast anti-inflammatory genes associated with cd4 t cells were downregulated in covid-19 patients relative to that in the hcs fig 4d e this suggested that cd4 t cells were the main participants in the virus infection comparison of the degs in the cd4 t cells revealed the enrichment of genes participating in the cytokine pathway and inflammation activation including ifitm3 and ifi6 and il1b jun fos junb and klf6 fig 4f further studies are needed to elucidate the ifn pathways involved in covid-19 pathogenesis tcr-seq analysis showed that t cell expansion was obviously decreased in the ers group than in the hc group fig 4g moreover nave or central memory t cells showed little clonal expansion while effector memory t cells terminal effector cd8 t cells ctls and proliferating t cells showed higher expansion levels fig 4h in addition the most highly expanded maximum clone in the ers group was trav8-6-traj45trav7-8-trbj2-1 supplementary fig s5d the decreased ratio of cd8 t cells in covid-19 patients may implicate the role of cd8 t cells in virus clearance fig 4c moreover the cd8 ctl with expanded clones also exhibited overactivated inflammation and antiviral activity compared to those in hcs fig 4i and supplementary fig s4b together these findings show that clonally expanded cd8 t cells in the peripheral blood of covid-19 patients help control the virus we also performed deg analysis via seurat findallmarkers analysis and found similar results in tprol cells supplementary fig s4c next we took the average of inflammatory genes for each nk and t cell subset scrna-seq subset in the covid-19 patients versus normal rna-seq data supplementary fig s4d by projecting the gene expression data of b cells using diffusion maps we identified four b cell clusters using scrna-seq nave b cells b1 expressing cd19 cd20 ms4a1 ighd ighm il4r and tcl1a memory b cells b2 expressing cd27 cd38 and ighg immature b cells b3 only expressing cd19 and cd20 ms4a1 and plasma cells b4 expressing high levels of xbp1 and mzb1 fig 5a b and supplementary fig s5a in comparison with that in the hcs the percentage of plasma cells increased significantly in covid-19 patients whereas nave b cells decreased significantly in the covid-19 patients fig 5c memory b cells and plasma cells mpb might play an important role in the control of viral infection and the development of adoptive immunity as they synergistically work and induce specific antibodies moreover compared to that in the hcs b cell activation-related genes including s100a8 igll5 ssr3 igha1 xbp1 and mzb1 were primarily expressed in the mpb of the ers group fig 5d we also found similar results in the plasma cells the antibody-secreting cells asc supplementary fig s5b c suggesting a key role for asc in viral control next we took the average of the inflammatory genes for each b cell subset of the covid-19 patients versus the normal rna-seq data fig 5e the difference in the genes between the ers and hcs indicated enhanced b cell reaction and antibody secretion in covid-19 patients go analysis revealed that igha1 xbp1 mzb1 jun polr2l and zfp36 were overpresented in mpbs which suggests enhanced b cell proliferation and viral transcription in covid-19 patients fig 5f single-cell bcr-seq analysis indicated that the iga isotype was over-represented in covid-19 patients compared to that in the hc fig 5g this corresponded with an increase in the levels of serum iga which was also pronounced in other coronavirus infections moreover the ratio of igaiggige to igdigm increased significantly in the ers patients and showed a downward trend with recovery time fig 5h using sc-bcr-seq to assess the status of clonal expansions in the blood of patients we found that il4r nave b cells showed little clonal expansion whereas cd27cd38 memory b cells showed the highest expansion levels among diverse b cell subsets fig 6a at the individual level we found that covid-19 patients had significantly expanded clones compared to that in the hcs supporting the assumption that b cells had experienced unique clonal vdj rearrangements under sars-cov-2-infection we also found that a higher b cell clonality consistently remained in the ers compared with that in the lrs patients fig 6b moreover quantification of the most highly expanded maximum clone for each subject showed that the ratios of the maximum clones were higher in the ers group than in the hcs fig 6c to understand the functional status of expanded cloned b cells we performed deg analysis between the cloned memory b cells and the other b cells our results revealed increased expression of b cell genes including cd27 ssr4 ighg1 mzb1 and xbp1 which further supports the superior effector functions of the expanded cloned b cells fig 6d moreover the differential genes for expanded b cells significantly subsided over time and reduced in lrs patients fig 6d to study the unique changes and preference genes of bcr in covid-19 patients we compared the usage of vdj genes in covid-19 patients with that in the hcs we identified an over-representation of the ighv3 family especially the ighv3-7 ighv3-15 ighv3-21 ighv3-23 and ighv3-30 in covid-19 patients compared to that in the hcs fig 6e the preferred igkvs were igkv1-17 igkv2-28 and igkv3-15 whereas the preferred iglvs were iglv1-44 iglv2-8 and iglv3-27 fig 6e moreover the top two pairing frequencies in ers patients were ighv3-23-ighj4 and ighv3-7- ighj6 fig 6f these cells showed igh subunit pairing with the igkl subunit encoded by iglv1-44-iglj3 and igkv1-17-igkj1 respectively which indicated expanded states associated with sars-cov-2 specificity individually ers-4 and ers-5 had the maximum clones referring to ighv3-23-ighj4 supplementary fig s5e and ighv3-7- ighj6 supplementary fig s5f respectively in summary an increase in clonality in covid-19 which was dominated by the iga and igm isotypes together with a skewed use of the ighv gene suggested the contribution of sars-cov-2 to pathogenesis notably the biased usage of dominated igv genes especially the ighv3-23 and ighv3-7 in covid-19 patients provides a framework for the rational design of sars-cov-2 vaccines an established computational approach17 was used to predict cell-to-cell interactions that may contribute to the distinct functional state of t cells b cells monocytes and dendritic cells dcs in ers and lrs fig 7a b in ers covid-19 patients we found adaptive signals involved in monocyte activation proliferation and inflammatory signaling fig 7a b t cells expressed genes encoding ligands of tnfsf8 lta ifng il17a ccr5 and ltb to tnfrsf8 tnfrsf1atnfrsf14 ifngr1 il-17ra ccr1 and ltbr which were expressed on monocytes and could contribute to the pro-inflammatory status other t cell-monocyte interactions involved the expression of csf2 and csf1 t cells might activate monocytes through the expression of csf2 and csf1 which bind to csfrs csfr21 and contribute to inflammatory storm a cluster of cd14 monocytes exclusively expressed il1 which was predicted to bind to il1rap expressed by t cells t cell-monocyte interaction may enhance immune response and be exclusive to covid-19 patients fig 7a b furthermore we found that monocytes highly expressed the poliovirus receptor which serves as a cellular receptor for poliovirus in the first step of poliovirus replication and induction of the nf-kappa b signaling pathway from the b cell-monocyte and b cell-t cell interactions we found that b cells could secrete a large number of il-6 lta and ltb which are combined with il-6r ltar and ltbr expressed in monocytes and a large amount of il-6 was applied to t cells to promote the secretion of ifn- il-1 and other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines thus a cascade signature of inflammatory monocytes with high expression of il-6 and their progeny were formed in the peak incidence of ers covid-19 patients fig 7c these activated immune cells may enter the circulation in the lung and other organs in large numbers and play an immune-damaging role in lrs covid-19 patients dc ligands were predicted to interact with b and t cell receptors involved in cell proliferation and the production of antibodies we discovered that the peripheral blood of lrs patients contains a diversity of antibodies we found that il18-il18rap tnfsf13-tnfrsf13b tnfsf13-tnfrsf17 tnfsf13b-tnfrsf17 tnfsf13b-tnfrsf13b and tnfsf13b-tnfrsf13c were highly expressed in our analysis of dc-b cell interaction fig 7d thus we speculate that dcs produce il-18 tnfsf13 and tnfsf13b to promote the proliferation of b cells and then secrete many antibodies into the blood in ers from the dc-t and t cell-b cell interactions we discovered that dcs produce not only il-18 but also il-7 to promote the proliferation of t cells moreover t cells produce il-2 to promote the proliferation and antibodies production of b cells fig 7d thus cell-to-cell interactions help us to understand why covid-19 patients manifested high rates of monocytes and low rates of lymphocytes and why the proportion of lymphocytes gradually increased in the peripheral blood of recovering patients the clinical presentation of covid-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe ards this has been similarly observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and influenza infections1214 in viral infection it is generally accepted that host immune responses determine both protection against viral infections and the pathogenesis of respiratory injury1819 a coordinated response in innate and adaptive immune cells working in concert may lead to the rapid control of the virus whereas a failed immune response might lead to viral spreading cytokine storm and a high mortality rate20 despite belonging to same group of viruses recent studies have highlighted differences between covid-19 sars and mers such as the speed of transmission treatment scheme and mortality rate moreover this difference may also exist in the key immune players and the underlying molecular mechanisms related to these diseases the lack of knowledge regarding the immune impact of covid-19 has now become a critical issue in view of its rapid spread and the shortage of specific therapy21 using single-cell sequencing we profiled the complexity of immune populations in the blood and analyzed 70858 cells from 10 patients we identified a hyper-inflammatory response in ers patients which may explain why some patients fell sick after being discharged and suggest that the current criteria for hospital discharge should be re-evaluated in addition we identified unique signatures of myeloid nk and t and b cells and pinpointed the changes in the epitopes of tcr and bcr our findings helped elucidate the antiviral immune mechanisms and revealed promising opportunities for developing immunotherapies using vaccines and neutralizing antibodies inflammation is a vital part of the immune systems response to covid-19 invasion previous and latest studies have reported significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines associated with disease severity in sars mers and covid-19 patients2223 among the various inflammatory cells monocytes and their subsets including classical intermediate and non-classical monocytes may play a critical role because they are known to fuel inflammation2427 in our study compared with the hcs ers patients demonstrated a significantly higher ratio of monocytes and these cells expressed higher levels of inflammatory genes intriguingly the ratio of classical cd14 monocytes was high in ers but remained normal in lrs furthermore cd14il1 monocytes which were absent in hcs could be observed in ers and they declined in number in lrs notably our cell-to-cell interaction analysis indicated that il1 csf1 il6 and csf2 may be associated with cytokine storm the cd14il1 subpopulation appeared to be part of the inflammatory landscape of covid-19 since these cells increased in ers stage virus-induced il-1 production in monocytes is mediated via a caspase-1 pathway multiple microbial components including viral rna are thought to trigger assembly of the inflammasome and consequent caspase-1 activation28 which may give a reasonable explanation for the presence of il1 monocytes in ers patients previous studies with a pathogenic influenza a virus revealed impaired neutrophil and cd4 t cell activation in il-1r1 mice greatly diminished lung inflammatory infiltrates reduced igm levels in both serum and at mucosal sites and decreased activation of cd4 t helpers in secondary lymphoid tissue29 indicating il1 is responsible for virus-induced lung immunopathology establishment cd14 il1 is also expected to become an important detection marker for monitoring covid-19 disease recovery collectively our data provide important insights into the role of monocytes in the immunopathogenesis of covid-19 the adaptive immune system harbors the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens through antibody and t cell responses30 inducing adaptive immunity is the aim of vaccination31 previous sars studies have identified binding and neutralizing antibodies elicited by sars-cov infection their therapeutic effect is unclear32 although robust antibody responses could be induced33 in covid-19 infection although several lines of evidence have consistently indicated a decline in lymphocyte counts the distinct immune characteristics at single-cell resolution are unclear irani thevarajan et al34 reported that in the blood of mild-to-moderate covid-19 hospitalized patients the antibody-secreting cells follicular t-helper cells activated cd4 and cd8 t-cells and igmigg sars-cov-2-binding antibodies were increased by using flow cytometry and they found the changes persisted for at least 7 days following full resolution of symptoms our scrna-seq analysis showed that compared with the hcs ers patients who recovered less than 7 days have a lower ratio of t and nk cells and these patients t cells express higher levels of inflammatory genes such as jun fos junb and klf6 several studies have reported that lymphopenia is a prominent part of sars-cov2 infection and lymphocyte counts are useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes3537 we found the number of nk and t cell decreased but no significant change in b cell in covid-19 patients especially in ers patients possible reasons for it may be the direct infection of lymphocytes by sars-cov2 cytokine-mediated lymphocyte trafficking in the infected tissue or lymphocytes exhaustion in the peripheral blood and sequestration in the lung induced by cytokine storm35 there may also be immune-mediated lymphocyte destruction bone marrow or thymus suppression or apoptosis38 as is reported in other virus infection which requires further study in addition high-throughput tcr sequencing identified expanded t cell clones in ers patients in lrs patients the immunophenotype was different in particular lrs patients would have an increase in t and nk cells with a lower expression of inflammatory genes we also performed a detailed analysis of b cells in patients and identified a higher population of plasma cells than that in the hcs we found that bcr contained highly expanded clones indicating their sars-cov-2 specificity importantly we found several loci unique to covid-19 infection the strongest pairing frequencies ighv3-23-ighj4 indicated a monoclonal state associated with sars-cov-2 specificity which has not been reported yet notably numerous studies have reported biased usage of vdj genes related to virus-specific antibodies for example ighv3-30 and igkv3-11 have been involved in encoding primary antibodies to neutralize human cytomegalovirus3940 in addition ighv3-30 and ighv3-21 have been utilized to isolate influenza virus antibodies and used for the production of virus vaccines4142 moreover a recent study demonstrated that antibodies combining the ighv3-15iglv1-40 segments had superior neutralizing activities against the zaire ebola virus43 in addition we observed lower expression of inflammatory genes in ers patients than in the hcs we envision that our results will provide direction for the development of vaccines and antibodies for covid-19 patients interaction between immune cells may help expedite or defer recovery from covid-19 infection our cell-to-cell prediction analysis utilizing scrna-seq data indicated that in ers patients b cell-derived il-6 t cell-derived csf1 m-csf and csf2 gm-csf may promote monocyte proliferation and activation as a result monocytes may produce a larger number of inflammatory mediators including il-1 and il-6 contributing to inflammatory storm in lrs patients both dcs-derived tnfsf13 and il-18 and t cell-derived il-2 il-4 may promote b cell survival proliferation and differentiation consequently b cells produce numerous sars-cov-2-specific antibodies to clear viruses which is in agreement with the research of zhou y et al44 who reported cd4 t cells are activated into t-helper th 1 cells and generate gm-csf etc to induced inflammatory cd14cd16 monocytes with high expression of il-6 and accelerates the inflammation after 2019-ncov infection the immune system comprises a network of cells tissues and organs that mediate host defense against pathogens immune cells can be classified into distinct types based on specific surface markers with the aid of flow cytometry and microscopy however not all immune cell types can be completely addressed by a separate analysis of phenotypic markers as many markers are expressed by multiple cell lineages or are regulated differently during inflammation in recent years sequencing technology has been widely used in biological research on this base scrna-seq is used in immunological research to seek to address previously unrecognized cellular heterogeneity and to reveal key pathways in gene regulatory networks that predict immune function45 in the present study we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of covid-19 scrna-seq is a powerful tool to identify novel cell subsets during disease progression in our study cd14il1 subpopulation was mapped using this method which uncovered the originator cells in ers patients in conclusion our study provided the first immune atlas of patients who have recovered from covid-19 and identified adaptive immune dysregulation after discharge the clonal expansion of both t and b cells indicated that the immune system has gradually recovered however the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 7 days after discharge suggested the need for medical observation after patients are discharged from hospital longitudinal studies of recovered patients in a larger cohort might help to understand the consequences of the disease the novel bcrs identified in our study may advance our understanding of b cell mechanisms and have potential clinical utility in covid-19 immunotherapies ten covid-19 patients diagnosed with by real-time fluorescent rt-pcr were collected in the wuhan hankou hospital china patients were divided into early recovery stage ers group and late recovery stage lrs group according to the days from first negative nucleic acid transfer date to blood sampling date we defined the ers group of five cases as the date of nucleic acid turning negative to blood sampling is less than seven days and lrs

 although the mechanism of olfactory and gustatory function loss remains unclear 5 these preliminary clinical findings may indicate that relatively rapid recovery of olfactory and gustative function can mean a resolution of viral infection in most patients and there was no distinction between hyposmia anosmia and dysgeusia contrary to what was found in other studies 6 the analysis of our sample revealed that covid-19 does not seem to cause permanent injury to olfactory and gustatory function because complete recovery occurs after two weeks self-reported olfactory and dysgeusia impairment has been recognized as a hallmark of covid-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome such alterations are mainly transient with a completepartial recovery within a few weeks although no clear evidence is available yet the present study suggests that coronavirus can induce a period of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction but in the studied population it does not cause permanent damage sources of support in the form of grants none declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper compliance with ethical standards the ethics committee of brescia asst spedali civili of brescia approved the study protocol np 4138-12052020

 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 became a viral pandemic that emerged from east asia due to sars-cov-23 in brazil the number of cases continues to increase with more than 66000 confirmed cases by the end of april 20204 however it is estimated that the number is even higher as the number of diagnostic tests performed is still insufficient for the national demand in covid-19 the most common otorhinolaryngological symptoms are coughing sore throat and dyspnea rhinorrhea and nasal congestion have also been found however there are reports of odgd5 6 and that they are present even before molecular confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection6 7 these observations were made recently in countries that started to perform molecular tests for covid-19 more extensively in which patients infected with sars-cov-2 reported severe od and gd without rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction in the beginning covid-19 was not suspected in some of these patients as they did not have fever cough or any other classic general signssymptoms of covid-19 the od and gd in covid-19 still show gaps in their understanding of both the clinical spectrum and the treatment to be proposed the advancement of knowledge on a specific topic can be facilitated through systematic reviews sr which make it possible to identify analyze and synthesize the best scientific evidence for best clinical practices especially in the face of new clinical scenarios such as the current covid-19 pandemic in that randomized controlled studies and precise recommendations for their management are not yet available the objective of this sr is to identify evidence of current knowledge on olfactory-gustatory disorders about the clinical presentation prevalence and possible specific treatments associated with covid-19 the strategies aimed at a complete search including descriptors medical subject headings - mesh and free terms which consisted of covid-19 2019-ncov 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia sars-cov sars-cov-2 sars coronavirus coronavirus coronavirus infection coronavirus covid-19 novel coronavirus covid-19 clinical features olfactory disorders olfaction disorders and taste disorders to identify the relevant articles for the proposed question a search strategy was developed covid-19 or 2019-ncov or 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia or sars-cov or sars-cov-2 or sars coronavirus or coronavirus or coronavirus infection or coronavirus covid-19 or novel coronavirus and covid 19 clinical features or olfactory disorders or olfaction disorders or taste disorders this strategy was adapted to the databases and the corresponding terms were applied in portuguese and spanish at lilacs database there was no restriction on the language of publication the complete search strategy is shown in the supplementary material appendix 1 between april 2 and 25 2020 the following electronic databases were searched medline via pubmed cochrane clinical trials sciencedirect lilacs scopus and google schoolar as well as the gray literature opengreyeu dissonline the new york academy of medicine and reasearch gate to prevent citation bias there was no manual search for the included articles and specialists in the field were not contacted9
 after the search the references of each database were exported to the mendeley program httpswwwmendeleycom aiming to identify all articles in duplicate promote greater selection reliability and proceed to the eligibility criteria step the following inclusion criteria were considered 1 observational studies with individuals diagnosed with coronavirus infection and 2 recording of the signs and symptoms of covid-19 with clinical aspects related to olfactory andor gustatory function the following exclusion criteria were considered 1 studies on non-human coronavirus 2 review articles 3 experimental studies in animals or in vitro 4 clinical report of odgd with onset prior to the sars-cov-2 infection the search for the articles was carried out by two reviewers the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were independently assessed by two researchers who were not blinded to the authors or the titles of journals the full versions of the potentially eligible articles were retrieved for further evaluation and were carried out in three stages1identification and reading of titles in different electronic databases articles that clearly did not meet any of the inclusion or exclusion criteria were excluded2reading of the abstracts of the studies selected in the first phase likewise articles that clearly did not meet any of the inclusion or exclusion criteria were excluded3all studies that were not excluded in these first two stages were read in full for the selection of the ones that would be included in this systematic review sr
 the main data for each article was fully collected and inserted into a database created in the microsoft office excel 2010 software there were no disagreements between the evaluators a standard form for data storage was created based on the model adopted by cochrane10 for a better presentation of the results it was decided to consider the following variables of the selected articles title author study location study design sample size n patients mean age and ethnicity both the diagnostic method and the most prevalent general signssymptoms and the severity of the clinical picture of covid-19 methods used in the olfactory-gustatory evaluation and the prevalence of od and gd the outcomes sought in the studies were both the demographic data prevalence and clinical expressions of odgd as well as possible specific treatments for such disorders in patients diagnosed with covid-19 the risk of bias was assessed according to the recommendations in the manual and the newcastle-ottawa scale adapted for cross-sectional observational studies11 study quality was independently assessed by two researchers and the divergences were evaluated by consensus the maximum score to be achieved was 10 points and the items evaluated on the scale were 1 representativeness of the sample 2 sample size 3 characterization of the diagnosis 4 risk exposure assessment risk factor 5 comparability to investigate whether individuals in different groups of results are comparable based on the study design or analysis control of confounding factors 6 evaluation of results and 7 statistical test table 1
 after these evaluations the selected studies were submitted to a statistical analysis to verify the possibility of building a meta-analysis this analysis combines and summarizes the results of several studies thus increasing the accuracy and power of evidence of the results in the first phase of this sr 1788 articles were found in six databases and none in the gray literature after eliminating 1023 studies in duplicate 765 were selected for the reading of titles and abstracts a total of 749 were excluded according to the established selection criteria 62 studies on non-human coronavirus 301 due to lack of data on clinical aspects 375 literature reviews and 11 experimental studies in vitro and 16 articles were selected to be read in full after the reading 10 articles were excluded as they did not have data on smelltaste table 2
 therefore six full articles were included in the qualitative analysis table 3
 the entire article selection process is described in fig 1
 which shows the prisma flow diagram for inclusion the analysis of the quality of the included articles and consequently of the risk of bias is shown in table 4
 all included studies are characterized as observational and cross-sectional studies moreover in the final evaluation all obtained a percentage of quality equal to or greater than 80 810 and four of the six articles obtained the maximum score of 90 910 only one of the studies carried out a census study the other studies did not perform a random selection of patients which compromises the representativeness of the samples but took into account the sample size all studies were concerned with the participants selection defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to exclude factors that could influence the results found the size of the studied samples was adequate to the central limit theorem for all studies and only two studies had samples smaller than 300 subjects the characterization of the diagnosis and the determination of exposure were very well described in all studies all studies controlled at least one variable allowing an efficient comparison among all studies the evaluation of the results was carried out in all studies through a specific report and the methods were described and validated in all studies finally all studies showed appropriate statistical tests with description of the statistical tests the levels of significance and the applications used it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis in this sr because the articles included had very different methodologies and measures resulting from the tests regarding the overall characteristics of the included articles table 3 the six studies were published in 2020 one in china12 one in europe13 one in iran14 two in the united states15 16 and one in the united kingdom17 the chinese study mao et al12 retrospectively evaluated 214 patients from three hospitals in wuhan the european study lechien et al13 cross-sectionally evaluated 417 patients in a multicentric model the iranian study moein et al14 studied 60 patients with covid-19 and 60 subjects in the control group matched for age and gender the two north-american studies were carried out by the same group of researchers yan et al15 16 while the british study menni et al17 evaluated through a census study 579 covid-19 positive and 1123 covid-19 negative patients the demographic data general symptoms and the prevalence of od and gd in patients in the six studies are depicted in table 5
 in total the six studies evaluated 1457 patients table 3 in the study by mao et al12 the sample consisted only of chinese patients in the study by lechien et al13 most of the sample consisted of european patients in the study by moein et al14 all patients were iranians in the two studies by yann et al15 16 most patients were north-american and in the study by menni et al17 the ethnicity of the study participants was not recorded the exam used for diagnosing covid-19 in the six studies was the rt-pcr real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction regarding the most prevalent overall signssymptoms of covid-19 there were differences between groups fever was the most prevalent sign in the studies by mao et al12 and by moein et al14 fatigue was the first symptom in the first study by yan et al15 and of menni et al17 coughing was the first sign in the second study by yan et al16 and in the study by lechien et al13 table 5 mao et al12 carried out the study at three hospitals designated for the care of patients with covid-19 which belonged to the union hospital of huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan china clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained medical team neurological symptoms fall into three categories skeletal muscle symptoms symptoms or diseases of the central nervous system cns and peripheral nervous system pns symptoms including od and gd data on all neurological symptoms were verified by two trained neurologists of the 214 patients studied 126 589 had mild-moderate disease 127 593 were females and the mean age of the group was 527  155 years compared to the patients with mild-moderate disease critically-ill patients were older 587  150 vs 489  147 years and showed fewer typical symptoms such as fever in 40 455 vs 92 73 and coughing in 30 341 vs 77 611 gd was identified in 12 56 and od in 11 51 patients regarding these disorders there were only references to hypogeusia and hyposmia and they were the main symptoms reported by patients with pns alterations with 1219 63 1119 578 respectively there were no records regarding the onset of olfactorygustatory disorders duration resolution or specific treatments lechien et al13 carried out the multicentric european study through the covid-19 task force of the young-otolaryngologists of the international federations of oto-rhino-laryngological societies yo-ifos in six belgian three italian and two french hospitals patients with olfactory-gustatory disorders of which onset occurred prior to the pandemic patients without laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 patients who were in the intensive care unit at the time of the study due to their health status were excluded therefore the sample consisted only of patients with mild to moderate disease clinical data were collected prospectively during the otorhinolaryngological consultation or by telephone for patients undergoing home treatment in this study patients filled out a questionnaire based on the smell and taste component of the national health and nutrition examination survey and the simplified version of the questionnaire of olfactory disorders-negative statements sqod-ns18 of the 417 patients 389 933 were european 263 631 were females all with mild to moderate pictures of covid-19 and with a mean age of 369  114 years in the evaluated sample 856 and 888 of the patients reported od and gd respectively there was a significant association between the two disorders p

factor that can be used as a marker for milder manifestations of covid-19 thus the authors suggest that od may be a clinical marker to help stratify disease severity at the beginning of sars-cov-2 infection there was no detailed data on the type of gd present or specific treatments for any of the disorders in the studied sample menni et al17 performed a census study using the radar covid-19

 regarding specific treatments there was no evidence of specific drugs that were effective for the recovery of olfactorygustatory functions nasal lavage was predominant in the studied groups therefore patients with covid-19 of different ethnicities were evaluated with high prevalence of impaired smelltaste with women being the most significantly affected gender unlike other viral etiologies sars-cov-2 can lead to loss of olfactorygustatory functions even without the presence of nasal obstructionrhinorrhea and with the onset of odgd even before the clinical signssymptoms of covid-19 there is evidence that odgd are strong predictors of infection by sars-cov-2 and it is possible to recommend the isolation of the patient as of the medical consultation and still without the result of the laboratory test to prevent the dissemination of the virus the recovery of smelltaste when it occurs usually does so within the first two weeks after the resolution of covid-19 no scientific evidence has been identified for effective treatments for any of the disorders the studies have shown that both olfactory and gustatory disorders of varying intensities and in which onset occurred prior to the general symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection may occur and such disorders should be considered as part of the symptoms that may be present even in mild cases of covid-19 there is still no scientific evidence of specific treatments for such disorders in covid-19 the authors declare no conflicts of interest  epidemic analysis of covid-19 in brazil by a generalized seir model a preprint suzete maria silva afonso juarez dos santos azevedo mariana gomes da silva pinheiro  we shall apply a generalized seir model to study the outbreak of covid-19 in brazil in particular we would like to explain the projections of the increase in the level of infection over a long period of time overlapping large local outbreaks in the most populous states in the country a time-dependent dynamic seir model inspired in a model previously used during the outbreak in china was used to analyses the time trajectories of infected recovered and deaths the model has parameters that vary with time and are fitted considering a nonlinear least-squares method the simulations starting from april 8 2020 concluded that the time for a peak in brazil will be in july 21 2020 with total cumulative infected cases around 982k people in addition an estimated total death case will reach to 192k in the end besides that brazil will reach a peak in terms of daily new infected cases and death cases around the middle of july with 50k cases of infected and almost 60k daily deaths  the seir model derives from the sir model and require a large amount of data over time to execute here we follow the adapted seir model developed by tan and chen in 13  which is the most reliable response to emergency public health actions and takes into account the population exposed to the virus more specifically we use the generalized version of the classical seir known as seirdp susceptible exposed infected recovered death insusceptible p which is a particular case of the model proposed by 10  in this model it is possible to include key epidemic parameters for covid-19 such as the latent time infected time protection rate and time evolution of the recovery this allows us to estimate the inflection point ending time and total infected cases in brazil and its states according to the ministry of health of brazil data the data are estimated considering a time window for collecting cure and mortality rates which provides more accurate information on the evolution of local cases the search for a reliable estimate of the number of infected and deaths is crucial so that public health systems can act to respond quickly to the needs presented for this reason many studies aim to estimate the contagion curve the spreading speed and the prediction of deaths recently imperial college 12 released a study on the current situation of covid-19 in brazil and estimate that human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 virus of the coronavirus family causing the disease covid-19 in brazil averages from 1 to 28 people they use a semi-deterministic bayesian hierarchical model that analyzes the impacts of interventions aimed at restricting the transmission of the virus but it is not clear how effective these measures were the model adopted follows a function of patterns in urban mobility to estimate deaths infections and transmissions some models can also predict the evolution of contaminants in real-time such as the ihme 1 with some important variables such as the transmission rate and the recovery rate neither static nor variable over time which makes the result very broad and somewhat vague local health policies and actions can also be taken to mitigate the virus some authors have also studied the impact of lockdown on the spread of the virus 11  others who used these models consider the study of public policies to mitigate the disease in specific locations 16  our simulations are based on general data from brazil and where different policies have been applied in each state according to hospital capacity and speed of contamination in this way we focus on responses to general data from brazil and in some brazilian states with a higher rate of cases in order to assist in medical and political actions in this work we analyzed the case data of covid-19 from the states of so paulo rio de janeiro cear esprito santo bahia amazonas par pernambuco and maranho to validate our results through the seirdp model we carefully collect the epidemic data from the ministry of health of brazil 2 from april 08th till may 21th 2020 and studied the approximation of the observed and computed data considering the infected recovered and death cases then we were able to estimate the parameters that characterize the natural history of this disease and allows us to investigate the projection of the epidemic in certain periods the seirdp susceptible exposed infected recovered death insusceptible p model used to analyze the coronavirus epidemic in brazil has the following variables  st susceptible population  et population who are exposed to the virus but not yet infectious in latent period  it population who get laboratory positive confirmation and with infectious capacity  rt recovery cases  dt death number  p t insusceptible cases  n  s  p  e  i  r  d is the total population   protection rate include people exposed to the infectious patients and people exposed to the asymptomatic patients   infection rate include exposed people catch covid-19 people get covid-19 with diagnosed confirmation and people without symptoms but can transmit it to others   1  average latent time  t coefficient used in the time-dependent cure rate  t coefficient used in the time-dependent mortality rate the variable described above are related through the following ode system 1 the model is time-dependent because the cure rate t and mortality rate t are analytical functions of the time defined by 3 respectively which are fitted according to the number of cases for t  t 0  t f  where t 0 and t f are the initial and final periods respectively equations 2 and 3 indicate that cure rate or recovery rate t goes up exponentially toward a threshold value and the mortality rate t should be zero after an infinite time moreover the parameters    1  t t were fitted in the least square sense the parameters    1   0   1  2   0 t 1 t are computed simultaneously by a nonlinear least-squares solver 8  we can replace them in the model 1 and calculate the time-histories of the different states st p t et it rt dt in this case we use the standard fourth-order runge-kutta process 6  for this the system of equations is written as a single ode anchored by the information from the public data of the ministry of health of brazil 2 we reliably estimate key epidemic parameters and make projections on the inflection point considering fitted and actual data experiments show the spatial distribution of covid-19 cases in brazil and in some states of the federation namely so paulo cear and rio de janeiro these states stand out for the highest incidence of covid-19 in brazil we also projected cases of covid-19 in other states in the country esprito santo bahia amazonas par pernambuco and maranho that had a large number of confirmed cases in relation to other states in the federation about i  8000 each one according in the last epidemiological bulletin of ministry of health of brazil in may 18 2020 fig 1a shows the first modeling and the projection for brazil from late early april to mid-may 2020 for the currently total infected recovery and death cases while fig 1 b presents its respective relative error solutions according to these results we can say that the model has a good correspondence with the data provided this means that the state parameters found by the least-squares solution should be suitable for projecting future dates a test was done with the traditional seir and the results were overestimated see fig 1c  in fig 2a  through the seirdp model we made the projections in the period from april to august according to this model the infected cases in brazil will reach to the peak at middle of july 2020 with about 982k cases in this sense the period also represents the peak time for medical resources get ready according to the ministry of health brazil has a total of 441811 hospital beds distributed in the countrys numerous regions from the number of infected we can see that the public health system in brazil may collapse in the middle of june the number of victims is also expected to grow in the same period it should be noted that these results are only predictions based on data and population mitigation policies these results may change as the populations isolation patterns change as studies in this direction indicate 11 16  modeling of the differential seir model from april 8 to may 21 fig 2b and fig 2c presents daily newly confirmed infected cases and daily death cases for brazil over the same period respectively the red lines indicate the actual data and the blue lines are predicted data from may to early of august 2020 as we can see that the daily infected cases seem reaching the peak around july 21 with about 55k per day and then start to decrease from fig 2c  we can see that the daily death is converging to approximately 6000 daily deaths without a projection of decrease in this period  so paulo is the second metropolis in latin america and the main financial commercial and corporate center in south america and where the first case of contamination in brazil was detected currently so paulo concentrates the largest number of infected with the new coronavirus for so paulo state the modeling and relative errors from the same period of brazil are shown in figs 3  we notice that the modeled curves present a good approximation with the collected data in addition a large part of the relative errors in infected cases recovery and death cases is below 20 in fig 4a we present an estimate of accumulative infected cases recovery and death cases projections show that the currently infected cases will reach a peak around july 20 close to brazil with about 114k cases fig 4b and fig 4c show the daily confirmed infected cases and the death cases for so paulo over the mentioned period respectively estimates show that the peak will reach in july 20 about 5k for daily infected and converging to 436 daily deaths till august 19 2020 the daily and cumulative peak has shown to be very close to the results obtained in the projection of brazil another important study presented is on the state of cear which recently showed a great increase in the number of cases for cear state the modeling and relative errors from the same period of brazil are shown in figs 5 looking at the curves modeled for cear state we see that the error curves of infected recovered and deceased cases also are oscillating around less than 20 in the period from early april to mid-may therefore it is possible to infer that the seirdp model provides a good approximation of the results with respect to the collected data in fig 6a we provide an estimate of accumulative infected cases recovery and death cases projections show that the currently infected cases will reach a peak around july 20 with about 80k cases fig 6b and fig 6 c present the daily confirmed infected cases and the death cases for cear over mentioned period respectively by the estimates we can conjecture that the peak will reach in july 07 about 1665 for daily infected converging to 1000 daily deaths till august 19 2020 a b figure 5  a predictions of the differential seirdp model from april 08 to may 21 2020 b the relative mean errors of projection for cear state from april 08 to may 21 2020 between actual data and seirdp model involving cases of infected recovered and death we also present a more detailed study of the second largest state in population of brazil and the second state to record cases of contaminated by the new coronavirus which is rio de janeiro the modeling and projection results from the same period of brazil are shown in fig 7a for infected recovered and deaths the results from april to middle may bring consistent response the respective relative errors are shown in fig 7b  according to fig 8a  the state of rio de janeiro projects that infected cases will reach to the peak around august 02 with about 191k cases which is close to period of the peak estimation of brazil this plot also suggests that the number of deaths will continue with the same growth trend in the cumulative total if the population is not subject to new rules of protection fig 8 b and fig 8c show the daily confirmed infected cases the death cases and the total accumulative infected cases for rio de janeiro state over mentioned period respectively rio de janeiro state will reach the peak around july 21 for both the daily infected increase about 9k per day but for daily death cases it will reach the peak of 800 per day around august 19 in this study a time-dependent seirdp model was used to analyze the evolution of currently active recovered and deaths cases in states in brazil whose infected toll exceeds 8000 cases actually the states esprito santo bahia amazonas par pernambuco and maranho marked together with so paulo cear and rio de janeiro have more than 90 percent of the total fatalities in the country as in previous experiments theses projections take into account mitigation and self-protective measures implemented by the government and the population in the periods given previously fig9 shows the prediction of infected recovered and death from april to early august according to this figure the state of pernambuco is close to reaching the peak of patients infected by covid-19 in mid-june giving the authorities time to plan control and mitigation measures during this period on the other hand the number of deaths maintains a projected growth in all states considered in this experiment  we consider an extension of the classical seir model known as seirdp with the aim of modeling covid-19 epidemics and introduce an estimation algorithm for brazil these parameters are found by applying the least-squares estimate in order to fit the seir differential equations to the daily and cumulative cases observed by symptoms onset the results revealed that the model 1 provides a good approximation with respect to the collected data since a large part of the relative errors in infected cases recovery and death is below 20 it should be noted that we need a reasonable set of data so that the estimates are more reliable fig 10 illustrates how bad can be the prediction if the data set is too small the case of brazil is used in the following display note that the discrepancies are significant when few points are used to measure the prediction of results but these discrepancies tend to reduce as the number of points increases according to the estimates obtained through the seirdp model the states of so paulo cear amazonas maranho esprito santo par and bahia will reach to the peak of patients infected in mid-july while rio de janeiro in early august in addition the daily number of deaths projects growth until august 19 2020 it is worth mentioning that the first cases were diagnosed in the country suspected cases and those who had contacts with confirmed cases were tested due to the large scale of contamination and low testing capacity the ministry of health started to recommend since mid-march that in places with community transmission only serious cases should be tested consequently many cases of coronavirus may have been underreported underestimating the results of the model another intrinsic problem raised by this study was the delay between the occurrences of deaths and their recording in official data released by the ministry of health unfortunately in some states much information arrived late this can compromise the projection results despite these problems we hope that the estimates obtained will minimize the influence of coronavirus in brazil especially in large urban centers whose probability of accumulating serious cases in the short term is high   effects of humidity and other factors on the generation and sampling of a coronavirus aerosol seung kim won m ramakrishnan a peter raynor c sagar goyal m   viruses are an important class of microorganisms that can pose serious airborne hazards to clinical and non-clinical health care workers and workers handling animals potential threats to the general public include bioterrorism especially from the smallpox virus and emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and avian influenza thus virtually everyone is at the risk of exposure to contagious viruses via inhalation viruses differ from other microorganisms in that they can replicate only inside a host cell however they can survive in the environment and be transmitted through air in the absence of host cells gerone et al 1966 viruses are 20300 nm in size and they usually travel in air carried by other materials such as droplets of respiratory secretions or dust particles otten and burge 1999 epidemiological evidence suggests that the transmission of viral infections may occur inside and between neighboring buildings donaldson 1978 riley et al 1978 blood and tissue aerosols generated during general and dental surgery may also contribute to the transmission of these viruses reponen et al 2001 testing the ability of heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac respiratory protection and other filters to capture biological aerosols is important to ensure that the filters perform as expected viruses are more difficult and expensive to use as a test aerosol for filters than other biological particles and considerable background knowledge and experience are required to handle them properly particles the size of single viruses will be captured primarily by brownian diffusion lee and liu 1982 however few studies have measured the collection efficiency of filters challenged by virus particles although bacteriophages eg ms2 have been used as a surrogate for human viruses in some studies foarde et al 1999 research triangle institute 2004 they cannot be expected to represent all types of human and animal viruses hence studies with these viruses are sorely needed in this study we used transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev of pigs as a surrogate for sars virus laboratory studies using tgev are safe to perform because the virus has no known adverse effect on humans further the data obtained using tgev should be applicable to the sars virus because both tgev and sars virus are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae fauquet et al 2005 and their physicochemical properties are similar although tgev has been utilized previously as a sars virus surrogate for studies of their genome expression thiel et al 2003 it has not been used in studies investigating the sampling and behavior of viral aerosols spendlove and fannin 1982 tseng and li 2005 the methodology for generating storing and collecting viral aerosols has been reviewed by a number of authors sattar and ijaz 1987 cox 1989 mitchell 1995 buttner et al 2002 sattar and ijaz 2002 factors affecting the viability of a virus during nebulization include nebulizer type nebulizer air pressure nebulization time microorganism type and humidity of the dilution air adams et al 1982 sattar and ijaz 1987 marthi 1994 listed humidity temperature radiation and open-air factors cox et al 1973 as the most important parameters influencing the viability of airborne microorganisms the method of aerosol generation composition of the generation fluid sampling method and collection medium were deemed to be secondary parameters although some factors may be more important than others for a particular virus all of them play a role in viral aerosol viability spendlove and fannin 1982 humidity in buildings can vary as a function of season and location consequently it is an important factor to study in terms of virus viability in the indoor environment bacteriophages influenza viruses and reoviruses each exhibit a unique dependence on relative humidity rh loosli et al 1943 hemmes et al 1962 adams et al 1982 trouwborst and de jong 1973 however the influence of humidity on the viability of coronaviruses such as the sars virus and tgev has not been studied previously all-glass impingers agi are commonly used for collecting viral aerosols spendlove and fannin 1982 sattar and ijaz 1987 sattar and ijaz 2002 tseng and li 2005 biosamplers were developed by willeke et al 1998 and their sampling performance for bacteria and fungi has been studied lin et al 1999 2000 agi-30 samplers collect most particles larger than 03 m in diameter buttner and stetzenbach 1991 the physical collection efficiency of the biosampler has been shown to be about 79 89 96 and 100 for 03- 05- 1- and 2-m particles respectively willeke et al 1998 biosamplers yield equivalent or higher culturable counts of bacteria relative to agi-30 samplers under the same conditions lin et al 1999 the physical sampling efficiency for both the agi-30 and the biosampler is less than 50 for particles with a diameter of less than 03 m and less than 10 for many particles with a diameter smaller than 01 m hogan et al 2005 these authors also showed that the recovery of airborne ms2 and t3 bacteriophages using an agi-30 sampler was greater than that using a biosampler however comparisons of biosampler and agi-30 performance have not been made for coronaviruses such as sars virus and tgev the ability of samplers to collect airborne particles with submicrometer diameters is important because many particles produced by coughing and sneezing are less than a micrometer in diameter gerone et al 1966 found that 50 of the particles produced by sneezing and 73 of the particles produced by coughing were smaller than 1 m in diameter nicas et al 2005 correctly pointed out that most of the mass of particles produced by coughing and sneezing will initially be in particles larger than 1 m in diameter however the water portion of droplets smaller than about 25 m in diameter will evaporate almost instantaneously leaving much smaller virus-containing particles suspended in the air musher 2003 filtration is an important method for reducing concentrations of biological particles inside of buildings the possibility of using hvac filters as a sampling system for airborne microorganisms has recently been proposed farnsworth et al 2006 in addition due to the threats of bioterrorism and pandemic influenza more consideration is being given to the virus removal efficiency of filters in hvac systems hitchcock et al 2006 the objective of this study was to characterize factors affecting tgev nebulization and to select the best sampling procedure for measuring the airborne concentration of this coronavirus characterization of factors affecting virus nebulization can be an important step towards the use of viruses as test aerosols once we are able to produce reliable virus-containing aerosols that knowledge can be used in many ways for example respirator and ventilation filters can be tested for their virus filtration efficiencies and virologists and toxicologists can use these techniques in their health effects research measurements of airborne tgev concentrations and the recovery of tgev from a filter medium were performed using an air filter testing apparatus suspensions of tgev were placed in a nebulizer and aerosolized into air flowing through the apparatus the tgev suspensions were titrated before and after nebulization on 36 different occasions to evaluate the effects of nebulization on virus viability the airborne virus particles were sampled at an rh of 30 50 70 and 90 using two different types of impinger samplers the virus particles were also collected on filter media inserted into the apparatus the tgev collected by the samplers and the tgev eluted from the test filters were quantified each combination of the four humidity levels with the two samplers was repeated three times for a total of 24 separate tests using these data we evaluated the tgevs airborne concentration and its recovery from test filters as a function of rh and sampler type each of the steps in this process is described in more detail in the following sections nebulization experiments were performed in a filter test apparatus fig 1 this apparatus was used by mccullough et al 1998 to study the penetration and loading of respirator filters with airborne fungi and bacteria tgev was aerosolized into the apparatus using a nebulizer and passed through a custom-made charge neutralizer containing a polonium-210 alpha particle source to imbue the virus with an equilibrium charge distribution this viral aerosol was then mixed thoroughly with filtered dilution air before it entered the test section the rh of the dilution air was controlled to 30 50 70 or 90 5 variation the test section consisted of a 15-cm-diameter vertical duct and a pneumatically controlled filter holder the total air flow rate in this section was 92 lmin the temperature during the experiments was approximately 23c

 swine testicular st cells atcc crl1746 were used for the propagation of the test virus the cells were grown in eagles minimum essential medium mem mediatech herndon va containing 150 iuml penicillin 150 gml streptomycin 50 gml neomycin 1 gml fungizone and 8 fetal calf serum the purdue strain of tgev was propagated by infecting st cells grown to 8090 confluency the virus was allowed to adsorb to cells at 37c for 1 h followed by the addition of mem without fetal calf serum and incubation at 37c after the appearance of virus-induced cytopathic effects cpe generally 4872 h post-infection the cells were subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4000 g for 20 min and the viral supernatant was aliquoted in small vials followed by storage at 70c until use on the day of testing 50 ml of stock virus was thawed at ambient temperature and placed into a nebulizer the tgev concentration in the 50-ml suspensions used during the experiments ranged from 178  103 to 562  106 tcid50ml 50 tissue culture infecting dose per milliliter with a geometric mean of 851  104 tcid50ml the tgev titers utilized in this study were maximized to the best of our ability to determine the titers of tgev serial tenfold dilutions of the nebulizer suspensions the collection liquid from the samplers and the filter eluates were prepared in maintenance medium followed by inoculation in st cells grown in 96-well plates using four wells per dilution after 4 days of incubation at 37c inoculated cells were examined microscopically for the appearance of virus-specific cpe and titers were calculated by the karber method karber 1931 to determine the effect of nebulization parameters such as nebulizer type nebulization time and incoming air pressure on the virus the titers of tgev before and after nebulization were measured two nebulizers a 6-jet collison nebulizer bgi waltham mass and a plastic medical nebulizer retec aerosol generator cavitron corporation englewood cliffs nj were utilized in initial tests in subsequent tests only the collison nebulizer was used dry filtered air was supplied to the nebulizers at pressures ranging from 7 to 15 psi for tests during which impinger sampling and collection by filters were performed air pressure to the collison nebulizer was fixed at 10 psi the liquid aerosolization rates for virus suspensions were between 01 and 02 mlmin depending on the type of nebulizer and the pressure airborne virus concentrations were determined using agis agi-30 ace glass vineland nj and biosamplers skc eighty four pa attached to sampling inlets inserted into the test apparatus the inlets with an inside diameter of 095 cm were positioned about 50 cm upstream from the mounting location of test filters although the inlets were perpendicular to the flow direction losses during sampling were minimal because the flow inside the apparatus was slow enough that a representative sample could be drawn brockmann 2001 the flow rate for both samplers was 125 lmin and sampling time was limited to 10 min to minimize both possible stress on viruses and evaporation of the maintenance medium used as the collection liquid no corrections were applied to account for incomplete physical collection of the airborne viruses or for possible inactivation of tgev during the sampling procedure to examine the recovery of tgev from a filter we selected an hvac filter medium these filters riga-flo 200ph camfil farr rancho dominguez calif were made from a microfine fiberglass laminated to a reinforcing backing according to the manufacturers specifications this class of filter is rated merv 14 by the american society of heating refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers ashrae standard 522-1999 ashrae 2000 merv 14 filters have been measured in laboratory tests to have efficiencies of 7585 for particles with diameters of 0310 m and 90 or greater for particles with diameters of 1010 m virus-laden particles with a diameter smaller than 03 m would be expected to be collected with at least 75 efficiency by diffusion test filter samples were cut from a regular-pleated hvac filter media and placed into a plastic holder that was sandwiched between gasketed flanges using the pneumatically controlled mounting system the portion of the test filters exposed to the tgev aerosol was a circle diameter 14 cm leading to a face velocity at the filter of 10 cms during each of the 24 separate tests a filter was exposed to virus-laden air for 10 min immediately after nebulization the filter was removed and cut into small pieces that were eluted with 50 ml 3 beef extract005 m glycine solution ph 88 using a vortex mixer for 1 min the ph of the eluate was immediately adjusted to ph 75 with 1 m hydrochloric acid to assess the effect of nebulization time the titers of tgev in the nebulizer suspensions after 10 or 30 min were compared with those of the original suspensions these times were long enough for 50 ml of a suspension to be circulated through the nebulizer many times therefore we can assume that almost all of the virus in the nebulizer experienced the stress of nebulization at least once to compare titers before and after nebulization the quantity  is defined here as 1documentclass12ptminimal

 the data indicate that neither the type of nebulizer the nebulizer pressure nor the nebulization time was an important factor affecting survival of tgev during nebulization ijaz et al 1987 found similar results after a 10-min nebulization of human coronaviruses poliovirus type 1 rotavirus and rhinovirus these findings may be explained by the small size of viruses because they are small they have little inertia when moving and therefore do not experience much physical stress due to acceleration or deceleration and impaction during nebulization viruses with structures differing from those of tgev may show a different result as shown in fig 2 aerosolization efficiency calculated using eq 2 decreased as a function of rh sampling with biosamplers led to higher aerosolization efficiency than sampling with agi-30 samplers at 30 and 50 rh the difference was statistically significant at p  0049 and p  0001 respectively this suggests that relative to agi-30 samplers biosamplers may have a higher physical sampling efficiency for the tgev-containing particles andor sample in a way that reduces inactivation of tgev

 our finding of higher virus levels measured with the biosampler for the coronavirus tgev is in general opposite the results reported by hogan et al 2005 showing higher airborne concentrations measured using the agi-30 for ms2 and t3 bacteriophages however our aerosolization efficiency was similar to those of reoviruses nebulized using a chicago atomizer without prehumidification of secondary air adams et al 1982 these authors also found that aerosolization efficiencies increased by approximately tenfold following the prehumidifying of the secondary air in the chicago atomizer two important processes may affect the measurements of aerosolization efficiency in our study 1 the viruses may have been damaged during sampling and 2 some of them may have passed through the sampler without being collected these processes were disregarded in the calculations which would lead to underestimation of true aerosolization efficiencies agranovski et al 2005 developed and tested a bubbler for sampling airborne microorganisms and utilized it to sample vaccinia virus in laboratory studies with a recovery of about 90 over 6 h of sampling the authors were careful to note that vaccinia strains are more robust than many other viruses when agranovski et al 2004 utilized the bubbler to sample sars virus experimentally they recovered more than 10 of the virus in 2 h of sampling a comparison of these data to the results from our study with tgev suggests that the bubbler may be a more suitable sampler for coronaviruses than the agi-30 and the biosampler the two different recoveries calculated by eqs 3 and 4 are summarized in table 2 because some of the measured airborne virus concentrations were zero corresponding filter recoveries based on airborne virus concentration ra could not be calculated ra estimated using agi-30 samplers showed higher values than ra from biosamplers this could be explained if the sampling efficiency for agi-30 samplers were lower than that of the biosampler some ra showed more than 100 recovery loss of survivability or infectivity during sampling could be the reason for these observations both ra and rn showed large variations

 table 2 shows that no virus was found in the three agi-30 samples at 50 70 or 90 rh for the biosampler virus was observed in only one of three samples at 70 and 90 rh these results indicate that the sampling of viable airborne tgev became more difficult as the rh increased and that the biosampler sampled tgev somewhat more effectively than the agi-30 virus recovery according to eq 3 could not be evaluated for all conditions due to the inability of the samplers to yield sufficient viable tgev for quantification if it were possible higher titers in the nebulizer suspension might have yielded quantifiable concentrations of tgev in the samplers however our methods were optimized to produce titers that were as high as possible for tgev propagated in st cells the inability to quantify tgev in the samples may be caused primarily by inactivation during travel through the air and during sampling in addition the recovery calculated in eq 3 may also be inaccurate because the size-selective sampling efficiency of agi-30 samplers and biosamplers is low for particles the size of individual viruses hogan et al 2005 and the size distribution of the tgev-containing particles being sampled is not known figure 3 shows the results for virus recovery according to eq 4 as a function of rh overall recovery was less than 10 potential reasons for recoveries less than 100 include 1 inactivation during nebulization 2 inactivation during transport through the air 3 inactivation during collection and retention on the test filter and 4 penetration through the test filter because nebulization losses were shown to be minimal and the filters tested in this study were fairly efficient most losses are probably due to inactivation during transport or during collection andor retention on the test filter the results in table 2 and fig 3 suggest that eq 4 is a more useful expression for evaluating tgev recovery from filters than eq 3

 our findings indicate that the survivability of tgev decreased substantially in the short time between aerosolization and sampling in addition the higher recovery of tgev at 30 rh suggests that this virus may survive longer in an airborne state and after sampling or collection at low rh than at high rh akers 1969 has proposed that humidity-dependent inactivation of aerosolized virus occurs immediately after they are sprayed and once established does not drastically changed with the aging of the aerosol it is generally believed that lipid-containing viruses including tgev survive better at low levels of rh and that the high rh levels are more conducive to the airborne survival of lipid-free viruses sattar and ijaz 1987 many airborne viruses are affected greatly by the rh of the air in this study tgev exhibited a better survival at low rh than at high humidity although the reasons for this behavior are uncertain they may be related to tgevs structure in general influenza virus survives best at low rh and low temperature loosli et al 1943 hemmes et al 1962 reoviruses show the least airborne viability near 50 rh adams et al 1982 while bacteriophage ms2 aerosolized from 01 m nacl was found to have the least relative recovery near 70 rh trouwborst and de jong 1973 unlike coronaviruses such as tgev and influenza viruses neither reoviruses nor ms2 have an envelope our results combined with those just mentioned suggest that enveloped viruses may be equipped to survive more effectively at low rh than at high rh whereas non-enveloped viruses may behave differently trouwborst and de jong 1973 suggested that the inactivation of airborne virus is related to the airwater interface and that this may be an important mechanism for lipid-containing viruses like tgev many biological materials are hygroscopic and demonstrate hysteresis in their water sorption isotherms following wet dissemination the rate of desiccation depends on the prevailing rh the most portable target molecules of rh stress are outer membrane phospholipids and proteins cox 1989 this mechanism may partly explain the sensitivity of tgev to relative humidity tgev was nebulized then sampled using agi-30 impingers and biosamplers and finally collected on an hvac test filter to measure the effects of nebulization stress and the recovery of viable virus from the filter titration of tgev in an aqueous suspension before and after the suspension was nebulized indicated that the act of nebulization did not inactivate the virus not surprisingly our results indicate that neither the type of nebulizer the pressure of the air supplied to the nebulizer nor the duration of nebulization affected the viability of tgev significantly virus recoveries calculated based on the amount of the tgev-containing suspension nebulized rn showed a dependence on rh with higher virus recovery at 30 rh than at higher humidities the reason for this behavior is uncertain but the results are consistent with those of previous investigations and suggest that enveloped viruses have a different relationship between virus recovery and humidity than non-enveloped viruses aerosolization efficiencies were also higher at lower rh and biosamplers collected airborne tgev viruses at a significantly higher efficiency than agi-30 samplers at 30 and 50 rh all of the results reported here are specific to tgev and the extent to which these results with tgev apply to other coronaviruses like the sars virus has not yet been tested however tgevs behavior is likely to be comparable to that of other coronaviruses due to structural similarities other viruses particularly those from other genera may behave differently  estimation of transmission potential and severity of covid19 in romania and

all religious scientific sports social or diversion occasions with more than 100 members for the next three weeks the number of affected people crossed the first hundred at the end of the second week of march the first three deaths were announced in romania on 22 nd march all three deceased were already suffering from different diseases such as diabetes dialysis and lung cancer etc 21  following a flood of new affirmed cases on march 24 the administration declared military ordinance establishing a national lock-down and bringing in the military to help police and the gendarmerie in authorizing the new limitations developments outside the homes was strictly prohibited with certain exemptions work purchasing nourishment or medication and so forth old people over 65 years were permitted to leave their homes just between 11 am-1 pm 22  two days after this on march 26 the national airline also suspended all local flights 23  total population of the romania is about 19 237 691 24  the average life expectancy for people of romania is 76 years 25  one can see from the model 1 that we are involving disease-related death and immunity so we have to fit our model with active real cases active means no disease-related death and no recovery so initially we have 3 active cases on march 5 2020 hence our initial conditions are i0  3 and r0  3 and rest are the susceptible we have simulated our model and fit with the real cases figure  2 portrays the fitting of our model 1 with the real data given in figure 1  by observing the figure 2 one can compare the actual data reported by 26 and the data collected by the simple sir model 1 given in section 2 we can see number of active cases are almost matching with the actual ones we also estimate number of covid-19 patients that will appear in next duration it can be observed from figure 2  that infection is continuously spreading un till august 2020 after this period the malady is going to stable under the current situation note that here we have taken the average rate and disease related death rate per day up to april 302020 according to our estimate there is no chance of vanishing the disease from community if the average daily and unfortunately disease related death rate is going on with the same rate from figure 2 we can see that the number of patients will be  10091 by the 31 st may on june 28 th patients will be  11127 and by the end of this year number will reach at  12000 week wise expected number of patients for the next months of this year is shown in table 1  which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 8 2020   according to reported data it has been observed that average weekly recovery rate and disease related death rate vary the maximum average recovery rate happened between 1  7 march and it is 571 during the week 29 march-4 april minimum average recovery rate has been observed and its value is 35 similarly average disease related death rate varies every week its minimum value occurred between 12 april-18 april which is 032 the maximum average number of deaths per day appeared during the week 29 march-4 april and its value is 07 we vary the values of recovery and disease related death rates by observing this pattern and estimate the number of patients that will appear in the later weeks of this year similarly we increase and decrease the values of transmission rate and inhibition effect up to 25 and 50 and also estimate the number of covid-19 cases the effect of the transmission rate  the death rate due to covid-19  recovery rate  and the inhibition or precautionary measures  on the number of covid-19 patients have been calculated and shown in figure 3  5 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission which was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity figure 3  variation in the number of active patients on transmission rate  recovery rate  death rate  and the inhibition effect  in figure 3a  we present the dependency of the number of patients on the transmission rate  the transmission rate is measured by the number of people get infected due to a source of covid-19 for example   01 means every 10 people per day get infected we can see from figure 3a that the number of patients accelerates as  increases the model fitted value for  is 0396 and for that value the number of patients by the end of this year will be  12000 since the transmission rate may vary for next duration so we have estimated the number of patients by varying the value of  upto 25 and 50 for   02 the number of patients by the end of this year decreases to  2364 for   03 this number will be  4046 for   05 the number of patients will be  7400 and for   06 the number of patients will be  9100 week wise number of patients for each value of  are given in table 2  we next present our results in figure 3c  for the death rate dependence  of the total number of covid-19 patients  it is the total number of patients who died per day due to covid-19 disease   0001 means one patient dies per day in every thousand patients since all the other parameters are fixed the trend of  dependence is higher the  lower the number of active patients as we know that  varies day by day so we have plotted for five different values of  ranging from 0003 to 0006 as the model fitted value of  turns out to be 0003 the total number of active patients by the end of this year ranges from 7000  6000 for this range of  week wise number of active patients for the different values of  are given in table 3  in figure 3b  we present our results for the change in the total number of active patients as a function of recovery rate of infected patients  as for the  and   is also measured 6 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

may 8 2020  as a ratio per day   001 means everyone out of hundred covid-19 patients get recovered per day definition of  infers the trend of the number of patients as a function of  higher the value of  means lower the number of active covid-19 patients the model fitted value of  is 0056 in figure 3b  we have plotted for five different values of  including the model fitted one also the other values of  that we have chosen are   0013 0056 0058 the total number of active patients by the end of this year ranges from  5613 to  23812 weekly details of the number of patients as a function of  is given in table 4  in figure 3d  we present our results for the number of patients as a function of the inhibitory effect  the model fitted value of  is 190191 since this number can also vary we have taken four other values of  in figure 3d  since  is proportional to the precautionary measures adopted by the covid-19 patients along with the general population higher values of  means lower the number of active patients the values that we have chosen for  other than the model fitted value are   95096 142643 237339 we can see in figure 3d that the total number of covid-19 patients ranges from 4591  11395 weekly data for the number of covid-19 patients as a function of five different values of  is given in table 5  according to the present recovery rate disease-related death rate and estimated values of transmission rate we observe that if we remove the social distancing and adopted precautionary measures then the worst effects appear in the population almost  55 population will be infected up to 31 st may and then infected people will begin to decrease note that this situation will according to the current position it means that it will happen only according to current

covid-19 pandemic was affirmed to have arrived at pakistan on february 26 2020 the first patient has been observed in sindh province and the second is in the federal territory of the country 27 within a week of appearance of initial two cases this pandemic started to increase other areas of the country on 29th april 2020 the quantity of affirmed cases in the nation is 15759 with 4052 257 of the commulative casesrecuperation and 346 22 of the commulative cases deceased and punjab is right now the area with the most elevated number of cases at over 6000 28  in figure 5 we have plotted only active cases with recovered and deaths from 26 of feb 2020 to 29 of april 2020 currently pakistan has approximately a total population of 220 millions 29 and life expectancy is 67 years 30  as we have included the disease related death and immunity in our proposed model 1 so this is telling us that we have to fit our model with the active cases of real data deaths and recoveries are excluded figure 6 is portraying the fitting of our model with real data given in figure 5 from 1 st of march 2020 to 29 of april 2020 the initial values are i0  4 r0  0 and the rest of the population is susceptible in figure we have compared week wise data and then extended this week wise data till 31 dec 2020 to forecast the covid-19 cases in pakistan according to the figure 6 there will be  30000 by the end of may 2020 and at the end of august this number would be  50000 week wise expected number of patients for the next months of this year is shown in table 7 8 all rights reserved no reuse allowed without

active cases on recovery rate  it is the rate which tells that how many people are getting immunity from this disease for example if   0001 then it means that out of 1000 people one person is recoverd per day we have taken four different values of  one is our model fitted value which is   0015 and three from the real data 28 by observing the real data we perceived that average recovery rate is maximum for the week 19 th  25 th april 2020 which is 0037 and minimum for the week 15 th  21 st april 2020 which is 0001 so we have considered these two values and fourth is the average of 0037 and

of covid-19 cases is inversely proportional to the recovery rate  which makes sense all the possible number of cases for all these values of  are given in table 9  next we will see that how the death rate  effects the number of covid-19 cases it is the rate which tells that how many people die from this disease for example if   0007 then it means that out of 1000 people seven people die per day we have taken four different values of  one is our model fitted value which is   000703844071 and three from the real data 28  we have seen that average death rate is minimum for the week 19 th  25 th april 2020 which is 0004 and maximum for the week 15 th  21 st april 2020 which is 000122985 fourth is 00008 it is the average of 0004 and 0001 figure 7c is depicting the number of active cases as a

covid-19 patients along with the general population higher values of  means lower the number of active patients the values that we have chosen for  other than the model fitted value are   150361 225542 375902 451083 we can see in figure 7d that the total number of covid-19 patients ranges from 5500  8000 the per day data for number of covid-19 patients as a function of five different values of  is given in table 11  we know that the major factor to aviod from the covid-19 are social distancing and precautionary measures in our model we have considered  as this major factor now if we have the present scenario and we consider do not take care of  then we can see from the figure that almost 33 population of the whole country will be infected till 19 th of july 2020 and this is the peak

to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 8 2020   in this study we used a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of the appearance of covid-19 cases in romania and pakistan as well as the ultimate number of patients according to the current situation by comparing model outcomes with the confirmed cases it has been observed that our estimated values have good correspondence with the confirmed numbers if the current pattern is going on then according to our estimate there will be  12000 infectious individuals in romania by the end of this year pakistan will bear the burden of  55800 till the end of december 2020 the situation will vary by the variation of transmission rate death rate recovery rate and further implementation of social distancing in both countries it has been observed that average weekly recovery rate and average weekly disease related death vary for both countries if the transmission rate in romania increases 50 and recovery rate and disease related death rate is taken for 30 th april according to reported data then there will be  9000 persons carrying corona malady and if this rate decreases 50 then 2364 infected persons will exist in the romanian community by the end of this year if we take previous average maximum weekly recovery rate and disease related death rate then there will be  5613 and  5301 patients respectively in romania similarly by assuming minimum weekly average recovery and disease related death rate will result  23812 and  5724 respectively the inhibition effect or precautionary measures also influence in the spreading of pandemic if the inhibition factor increases upto 50 then  4951 patients will be existing in romania till the end of this year this number will exceed to  11395 if precautionary measures decreases to 50 the worst effects of the disease appear in the community if we remove all the barriers in such case this malady may increase by effecting  55 population till the end of this month this number will start to decrease after may increase or decrease in transmission rate will also results in decrease or increase in the number 23 all rights

to reported data then there will be  28708 persons having corona disease and if this rate decreases 50 then 4723 infected persons will exist among pakistanis by the end of this year if we take previous average maximum weekly recovery rate and disease related death rate then there will be  16716 and  815 patients respectively in pakistan similarly by assuming minimum weekly average recovery and disease related death rate will result  138611 and  16716 respectively the inhibition effect or precautionary measures also influence in the spreading of pandemic if the inhibition factor increases upto 50 then  11149 patients will be existing in pakistan till the end of this year this number will exceed to  33387 if precautionary measures decreases to 50 the worst effects of the disease appear in the community if we remove all the barriers in such case this infection may increase by effecting  33 population till the end of this month this number will start to decrease after may 2020 although these estimates may vary with the passage of time but it will really help us to observe the most influential factors that causes to increase the epidemic on the basis of this analysis competent authorities may design the most effective strategies in order to control the epidemic  single particle assay of coronavirus membrane fusion with proteinaceous receptor-embedded supported bilayers deirdre costello a jean millet k chih-yun hsia gary whittaker r susan daniel   like influenza virus many coronaviruses can use the endocytic pathway to enter cells 19 once inside the endosome the challenge for viruses is delivering their genetic material across the membrane and into the cytosol for viral replication all enveloped viruses have membrane proteins that facilitate the fusion of their lipid envelope with the host cell membrane 20 coronavirus particles possess at their surface the spike s envelope glycoprotein which is a class i fusion protein 21 whereas the structure and function of the prototypical class i fusion protein influenza virus hemagglutinin ha is well understood structurefunction relationships for coronavirus s proteins are not well characterized for coronaviruses the s protein mediates virus entry and determines cell tropism and pathogenesis 22 like influenza virus ha the coronavirus s protein has two primary functions 1 it controls the binding of the virus to a cell membrane receptor and 2 it mediates membrane fusion between the viral and host membranes 20 in general receptor binding is controlled by the s1 domain of the protein while membrane fusion is mediated by the s2 domain a conformational change in the s2 domain is believed to drive the viral membrane to fuse with the host membrane for most coronaviruses this conformational change is triggered by the acidification of the endosome although ph-independent fusion can also be observed it is generally believed that all class i fusion proteins follow a common fusion pathway that has been well-established in the prototypical class i influenza virus class i fusion proteins go through a multi-step process to achieve a fusion pore that begins with a fusion protein conformational change triggered by low ph during the conformational change the fusion protein unfolds and thrusts the fusion peptide into the hydrophobic region of the host membrane next the protein folds back bringing the anchored membrane in close contact with the viral membrane until a stalk-like structure is formed the stalk structure results from the mixing of the outer leaflet of the host membrane with the viral membrane referred to as hemifusion after a short lag time the stalk is converted into a fusion pore through which the viral contents can exit it may be necessary for multiple fusion proteins to work in concert to bend the membrane to induce fusion analogous to influenza ha it is believed that the coronavirus s protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage prior to fusion activation 22 proteolytic cleavage is believed to expose specific regions of the s protein including the fusion peptide 23 because proteolytic cleavage dictates fusion competency the availability of proteases in the extracellular milieu is another key factor in tropism of coronavirus a dramatic example of this is human sars-cov the bound virus is able to fuse at the cell surface in absence of acidic ph when exposed to exogenous proteases 24 this route of entry may even be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more efficient that the endosomal pathway 24 in this case proteolytic cleavage changed the fusion pathway by combining single particle fusion with proteinaceous supported bilayers and microfluidics the sequence of triggers can be controlled and the associated fusion pathway and

obtained from a siemens purelab ultra water purification system clean slides were stored under deionized water and dried with a stream of ultra-pure nitrogen gas prior to use for bilayer formation glass surfaces were used either with pdms wells or microfluidic devices to form the pdms wells a thin sheet of pdms was made in a petri dish using 101 elastomercrosslinker mixture of sylgard 184 robert mckeown company branchburg nj the pdms was baked for 3 h at 80 c cut into small squares approximately the same size as a coverslip and a hole punched through each square to form the wells pdms squares were then attached to a clean glass coverslips which formed the bottom of the wells the approximate volume of a well was 100 l microfluidic devices for the fusion experiments were fabricated using soft lithography the microchannel pattern was designed using the cad software program l-edit tanner eda and a master of the flow pattern was made on a silicon wafer at cornell nanoscale science and technology facility cnf each microfluidic device contained six channels the dimensions of each channel are 1 mm wide by 70 m deep with a total length of the channel of 15 cm the spacing between the centers of each channel is 1 mm the silicon wafer was coated with p-20 primer in a spin coater followed by spr220 megaposit photo-resist the wafer was baked for 90 s at 115 c and then exposed to uv light for 75 s in an abm contact aligner to pattern the wafer with the flow cell design following this step the wafer was baked again for 90 s at 115 c and then developed for 60 s in a hamatech-steag wafer processor the pattern was then etched into the wafer using an unaxis 770 deep si etcher the depth of the channel was determined using a tencor p10 profilometer microfluidic devices were formed using pdms in a molding process to facilitate the release of the cured pdms after molding on the etched silicon master the master slide was first coated with sigmacote sigma a 101 elastomercrosslinker mixture of sylgard 184 was mixed and then degassed before pouring on the silicon master slide etched with the flow cell pattern the pdms was then baked for 3 h at 80 c after baking pdms microfluidic devices were peeled off of the wafer and inlet and exit ports were punched in each channel of the device both the clean glass coverslip and pdms mold were treated with oxygen plasma using a harrick plasma cleaner model  pdc-32g ithaca ny at a pressure of 750 m on the high setting for 25 s gently pressing the surfaces together resulted in a tight bond between the glass and pdms and formed the four walls of the microfluidic channel a solution containing a 14 dilution fapn-blebs in buffer a was drawn into the microchannel at a flow rate of 30 lmin for 1 min and incubated on the glass surface for 20 min the microchannel was then rinsed with buffer a at 100 lmin for 2 min a solution of bhk-liposomes 05 mgml was drawn into the microchannel at 100 lmin for 1 min and incubated for 10 min to heal any defects in the membrane more vesicle solution was drawn into the microchannel at 10 lmin for 5 min finally the microchannel was rinsed with buffer a at 100 lmin for 2 min to remove any excess liposomes integrity of bilayers and diffusion of the lipids within it was examined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching frap bilayers were formed following the above procedures inside pdms wells r18 was used to label the bilayer and carry out the photobleaching experiments once formed bilayers were gently scratched with a dissection tool to remove a thin section to aid in focusing on the plane of the bilayer on the microscope following this step the bilayer was rinsed again for 1 min with buffer a to wash out any lipids removed by scratching a 20 m diameter spot in the supported lipid bilayer was bleached with a 47 mw 488 nm kryptonargon laser for 200 ms the recovery of the intensity of the photobleached spot was recorded for 15 min at regular intervals the fluorescence intensity of the bleached spot was determined after background subtraction and normalization for each image the recovery data was fit using a bessel function following the method of soumpasis 29 the diffusion coefficient is then calculated using the following equation dw24t12 where w is the full width at half-maximum of the gaussian profile of the focused beam for protein mobility single particle tracking at 100 magnification was conducted fluorescently labeled fapn-specific antibodies see next section for antibody and labeling details were bound to fapn in the bilayer and monitored for at least 40 min to determine if any proteins diffused during that time fig s3 summarizes the protein mobility results to confirm that fapn proteins were incorporated into the supported bilayer and the active extracellular end was oriented facing the bulk solution ie not inverted towards the glass support the bilayer was incubated with an fapn-specific antibody rg4 30

gml of a primary antibody anti-fapn mouse monoclonal antibody rg4 for 20 min the unbound primary antibody was rinsed and 1 gml of alexa fluor 488 conjugated-goat anti-mouse igg secondary antibody was added and incubated for 20 min excess secondary antibody was rinsed and the sample was imaged on an inverted fluorescence microscope with appropriate filter set described below blebs containing human apn hapn were formed as previously described for fapn-blebs the activity of hapn and empty vector cell blebs in solution was tested using bulk fluorescence measurements in fluorometer photon technologies international inc at an excitationemission of 380460 nm the substrate for hapn h-ala-amc was purchased from bachem a 5050 mixture of blebs and h-ala-amc substrate at 270 m in a 50 mm tris buffer at ph 74 were mixed in a quartz cuvette and intensity of the mixture was monitored for 30 min bleb-derived supported bilayers containing hapn were formed in microfluidic channels as previously described for fapn-sbs the substrate at concentration of 270 m in 50 mm tris buffer at ph 74 was drawn into the channel at a flow rate of 100 lmin for 2 min the fluorescence intensity of the channel was observed at 10 magnification at an excitationemission of 380455 nm a control channel containing an empty vector bleb-derived supported bilayer devoid of exogenous apn proteins was subjected to the same conditions as described above 
fig s5 summarizes the enzyme activity assay results in fig s5a blebs with and without hapn were loaded into cuvettes and the fluorescence monitored temporally using a fluorometer after the substrate was added the empty vector blebs show no appreciable fluorescence while the hapn blebs continue to increase in signal as increasing amount of substrate is cleaved during the course of the experiment in fig s5b supported bilayers with and without hapn are loaded into a microfluidic channels with substrate the microfluidic device is monitored at specific time points and the two channels are compared in the inset in the control case no fluorescence is detected above the background but the hapn-sb shows significant intensity after several hours in order for class i fusion proteins to become fusion-competent they must first be activated by proteolytic cleavage a modification performed by cellular proteases there are numerous enzymes capable of proteolytically cleaving the coronavirus spike protein these proteases can be found in either the intra- or extra-cellular environment for example cathepsin proteases found in the endosomal compartment are naturally used to breakdown proteins taken up into the lysosome 33 once a virus gets endocytosed cathepsins can also cleave the coronavirus spike protein 25 34 35 36 37 trypsin is a common extracellular protease found in the digestive tract of many vertebrates 38 to break down proteins during digestion 38 we show here that trypsin is also capable of cleaving the spike protein of coronaviruses cleavage likely occurs at two distinct sites for coronavirus s at the junction of the s1s2 domains as well as within the s2 domain s2 39 proteolytic cleavage is believed to expose specific regions of the s protein including the fusion peptide 23 for some coronaviruses cleavage at s1s2 is necessary to allow subsequent cleavage at s2 and allow the s2 domain to respond a low ph trigger that initiates the conformational change required for fusion 39 in other coronaviruses in particular alphacoronaviruses like fcov-1683 the s1s2 site does not need to be cleaved in these cases activation is likely mediated solely through the s2 cleavage site we used trypsin as a means to activate fcov-1683 s to confirm that trypsin can proteolytically cleave fcov-1683 s in an appropriate manner fcov-1683 viral suspensions were ultracentrifuged at 42000 rpm in a tla 55 rotor using an optima max-e ultracentrifuge beckman coulter for 2 h at 4 c the viral pellets were resuspended in 50 l of pbs non-treated sample or pbs containing 3 gml of l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone tpck-treated trypsin thermoscientific trypsin treatment or mes buffer ph 50 supplemented with 25 mm edta and 2 mm dtt and containing 05 m cathepsin b calbiochem the samples were incubated at 37 c for 1 h except the cathepsin-treated sample which was incubated for 15 min at 37 c all samples were then subjected to treatment with the deglycosylating enzyme pngase f new england biolabs using 2500 units and supplied buffer at 37 c for 16 h this was done to avoid having differentially glycosylated species of s protein lds loading buffer invitrogen with dtt 50 mm final was added to samples and were subjected to 5 min 95 c incubation for denaturation the samples were then analyzed by western blot using fcov-s-specific mouse mab 22g64 provided by dr ed dubovi animal health diagnostic center new york state college of veterinary medicine cornell university followed by incubation with hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg abcam as shown in fig s6 cathepsin b and trypsin treatment yield major cleavage products at approximately 100 kda while in the non-treated sample the majority of s protein migrated as a single band around 200 kda indicating little cleavage event occurred without protease treatment these results show that trypsin cleaves fcov 1683 s in a similar way as does cathepsin b and are consistent with published results for this virus cleaved with cathepsin b 25 membrane fusion assays were conducted with total internal reflection fluorescence tirf microscopy using an inverted zeiss axio observerz1 with a  plan-apochromat 100 oil objective with a numerical aperture na of 146 index-matching liquid carl zeiss inc was used to couple the glass coverslip of the microfluidic device to the objective in this setup two lasers can be used simultaneously to excite different color fluorophores we used 561 nm and 488 nm excitation wavelengths from solid-state lasers these were coupled into the optical pathway of the microscope using a laser tirf 3 slider carl zeiss inc which controlled the angles of incidence exceeding the critical angle for glasswater interface 62 ensured total internal reflection of the lasers and created evanescent waves about 100 nm thick at this thickness the evanescent waves excited fluorophores positioned within the supported bilayer or virions labeled r18 the excitation laser light was band-pass filtered through a semrock 74 he gfpmrfp filter cube and then combined with a dichroic mirror before being focused on the outer edge of the back aperture of the objective the fluorescence emission signal was filtered through a 52531 and 61657 nm dual band-pass emission filter and then sent to an electron multiplying ccd camera hamamatsu imageem c9100-13 bridgewater nj the images acquired during the membrane fusion assays were analyzed using both imagej nih and matlab mathworks fusing particles were manually selected in imagej and the fluorescence intensity in a 4  4 pixel region around each particle was collected as a function of time in videos where background noise was high due to a large amount of fusion events a rolling ball background subtraction algorithm was applied to all of the images to remove excess background noise as the fluorophores diffused into the membrane after hemifusion the rolling ball algorithm determines the local background for every pixel by averaging over a large circular region around the pixel this background value is then subtracted from the original image the fluorescence trajectories for the particles were then imported to matlab mathworks for further analysis a code written in matlab determined the onset time of the dequenching spike for each particle by finding the time of the maximum intensity in each particle trajectory supplementary data related to this article can be found online at httpdxdoiorg101016jbiomaterials201306034 the following are the supplementary data related to this article
 the accuracy with which n and k
h can be determined depends on both the number of experimental observations and the number of steps in the process 40 to accurately estimate n from a gamma distribution a minimum number of a fusion events must occur for statistical significance for example to distinguish a 2-step process from a 3-step process ie n  2 from n  3 a minimum of 50 fusion events must be observed 40 the number of fusion events that occurred during each experiment reported here varied from 70 to 120 pure liposome solutions prepared as described in the methods section self-assemble on glass to form supported bilayers via vesicle fusion 41 42 proteoliposomes on the other hand generally do not readily form supported bilayers on their own we discovered that proteoliposomes derived from cell blebs could be induced to form supported bilayers with the addition of pure liposomes 18 we describe this self-assembly process here in the context of forming fapn-supported bilayers fapn-sb as substrates for fcov fusion studies the process is illustrated in fig 1
top and begins with the formation of cell blebs containing fapn the detailed procedure for forming cell blebs containing fapn from bhk cells can be found in the methods section fapn blebs are then used to form proteinaceous supported bilayers as will be described in detail next once the proteinaceous supported bilayer is formed fcov binds to fapn localizing the virus within the evanescent wave and enabling single particle fusion experiments that will be described in a later section to visualize the formation of the supported bilayer from fapn-blebs derived from bhk cells the bleb membranes were labeled with a lipophilic fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine r18 see methods section a small aliquot of the labeled bleb solution was added to a pdms well and incubated for 10 min at room temperature during this time blebs contact and adsorb to the glass surface excess blebs that did not adsorb to the glass surface were removed by gently rinsing the well with buffer a 2 mm cacl2 10 mm hepes 150 mm nacl at ph 74 at this stage the adsorbed intact blebs stick to the glass surface as intact proteoliposomes as seen in fig 1 t  0 image as punctuate spots to induce the formation of a supported bilayer from the adsorbed blebs we formulated liposomes to match closely the bhk endosomal membrane composition 26 referred to as bhk-liposome and added this solution to the pdms well containing the adsorbed blebs in this experiment the bhk-liposomes are devoid of fluorophore labels this labeling scheme assists in observing the formation of the supported bilayer as the initially punctuate blebs rupture and the r18 disperses throughout the newly-formed planar bilayer fig 1 bottom image series note that as the r18 spreads in the bilayer and gets diluted with the unlabeled bhk lipids the fluorescence signal increases due to fluorophore dequenching bilayer formation is verified by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching frap in this technique a laser beam is used to photobleach a 20 m diameter spot in the newly-formed fluorescently-labeled r18 supported bilayer the recovery of the fluorescence in this photobleached area is used to determine the 2d mobility of r18 embedded in the planar supported bilayer which in turn verifies that the r18 is no longer confined to discrete bleb vesicles adsorbed to the glass surface but freely moving throughout a 2d bilayer plane frap interrogates a macroscale area microns and thus is useful for characterizing how well the bilayer has formed over this length scale note that the largest population of blebs is on the order of 500 nm in diameter fig s1 so if the blebs have not ruptured into a contiguous planar bilayer then the fluorescence will not be able to recover after the sample is photobleached this lack of recovery was confirmed by preparing samples containing only adsorbed cell blebs no addition of bhk-liposomes photobleached spots did not recover on these samples for mobile samples we obtain two quantitative measurements from these experiments the mobile fraction and the 2d diffusion coefficient samples were prepared on glass surfaces in pdms wells as described above fig 2
is a typical fluorescence recovery of r18 in a fapn-sbs from this plot the recovery is nearly restored to 100 indicating that the mobile fraction of r18 in the fapn-sb is quite high the reported diffusion coefficient averaged over several similarly-prepared samples is 035  0005 m2s mobile fraction and diffusion coefficient values compare well with a control bilayer made of only r18-labeled bhk-liposomes see supplementary information for data fig s2 note that the recovery curve is smooth and fits well to the 2d diffusion model black line irregular recovery could indicate either disconnected isolated bilayer patches that did not heal to form a contiguous film over this length scale or the presence of lipid microdomain formation this data indicates that the bilayer has a relatively uniform distribution and is contiguous other possibilities for the structure of the bilayer include partial bleb rupture such as only the outer leaflet fusing to the bhk-liposomes however because the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions in the pure bhk-liposome slb and fapn-sb bilayers are comparable this structure can be ruled out by the following argument if the blebs were only partially fused then the r18 trapped in the inner leaflet could not readily exchange with the surrounding lipids after being photobleached this behavior would manifest as a slower recovery and reduced mobile fraction relative to the pure bhk-liposome case over the same timescale of recovery experiment once the bilayer was formed we verified that the fapn proteins were incorporated into the supported bilayer and the active extracellular end was oriented facing the bulk solution ie not inverted towards the glass support by labeling with a fapn-specific antibody against the extracellular portion of the protein details of these experiments and controls are provided in the methods section fig s4 and confirm that fapn is in the bilayer and oriented properly next we tested apn activity in the blebs and support bilayers using an enzyme activity assay see methods section fig s5 summarizes the enzyme activity assay and the results show that apn is enzymatically active in the supported bilayer derived from cell blebs taken together the antibody binding assay and the enzymatic assay results corroborate that apn protein is functional and maintains its native activity and orientation in the supported bilayer we note that while the r18 and lipids are mobile in the fapn-sb fig 2 the proteins do not appear to be mobile to the same extent fig s3 because apn is the binding receptor for the virus immobility will reduce the strength of binding avidity of the virus to the supported bilayer however as long as one receptor bond in able to hold the virus in close proximity to the supported bilayer and within the evanescent field prior to fusion initiation we can still track individual virus fusion events using tirfm as will be shown in the next section we coated microfluidic channels with supported bilayers devoid of or containing fapn to make the bilayers either empty-vector blebs or fapn blebs were used following the procedure described above for pdms wells but modified slightly to be compatible with a microfluidic device a description of this procedure is in the methods section we prepared two suspensions of fcov virus the first was treated with the protease trypsin 25 gml for 15 min at 37 c prior to fluorescence labeling and the second suspension was left untreated fig s6 demonstrates by western blot analysis that trypsin treatment of fcov-1683 virions results in proper cleavage activation of the s protein this cleavage step is necessary to prime the s protein for the fusion assay that will be carried out following virus binding next suspensions of fluorescently-labeled trypsin-treated fcov were sent through the channels and incubated for 20 min during this time virus bound to the fapn in the supported bilayer but virus introduced to the channels containing empty-vector-sbs showed no visible binding fig 3
 comparing these results emphasizes the requirement that the supported bilayer contain fapn to localize the virus at the bilayer surface to monitor and distinguish the intermediate steps in the fusion pathway from each other in the single particle fusion assay we use a dual-color labeling scheme fig 4
 as described in the methods section here the viral membrane is labeled with a green-emitting lipophilic fluorophore r110c18 and the internal contents are labeled with a red-emitting fluorophore srb with this scheme hemifusion of the outer leaflets is marked by fluorescence dequenching of r110c18 when the outer leaflets mix pore formation is marked by a drop in srb fluorescence at the fusion site indicating release of the internal contents these colors are co-localized in one particle by simultaneous monitoring of both emission wavelengths using tirfm in this way three important time intervals can be obtained for each individual particle 1 the time for the onset of hemifusion 2 the lag time between hemifusion and pore formation and 3 the time when the internal contents is released in our assay membrane fusion between bound trypsin-treated fcov and supported bilayers is primarily initiated with acidic buffer although on occasion some cleaved viruses spontaneously fuse prior to acidification to test the influence of triggering ph on fusion kinetics buffer solutions 150 mm nacl 15 mm mes 5 mm citric acid pre-calibrated over a range of acidic ph values up to ph 70 were used each solution was sent through a microfluidic channel at a flow rate of 100 lmin for 2 min to acidify the system the time at which acidification of the flow cell occurred was marked by an obvious decrease in fluorescence of the ph-sensitive fluorophore oregon green dhpe present in the supported bilayers for this purpose tirfm images were collected at an interval of 100 ms for three or 4 min a series of images of a single virion undergoing hemifusion triggered at ph 53 is provided in fig 5
a the dequenching spike is traced in the plot beneath the images the time at which the onset of hemifusion occurs following acidification at t  0 is declared as the start of the dequenching spike for each individual virus fusion event in the field of view a cumulative distribution curve for each triggering ph was generated by plotting the frequency of hemifusion events as a function of the times of the onset of each hemifusion event for a given triggering ph a curve like in fig 5b is then fit with a cumulative gamma distribution equation 1 to estimate the kinetic parameters1ph0tkhntn1nekhttwhere k
h is the hemifusion rate constant t is time and n is an additional fit parameter often correlated to the number of steps or the number of fusion proteins that act together to initiate fusion 5 a gamma distribution is commonly used to fit single particle kinetics of membrane-enveloped viral fusion because individual fusion events occur independently of each other the gamma distribution describes a multistep reaction scheme where each step is a stochastic poisson process with a rate constant k this model has been used to analyze the kinetics of single particle influenza fusion 5 7 and because of the similarity between the class i fusion proteins of ha and s this model is used to analyze coronavirus fusion here the probability distribution was fit to our data using a non-linear least squares fitting algorithm 
fig 5cd summarizes the hemifusion kinetic parameters obtained for trypsin-treated fcov over a range of triggering ph 40 to 60 we note that at phs above 60 the number of fusing particles was too low to obtain statistically significant kinetic parameters the data presented here ph 4060 corresponds to experiments where at least 50 fusion events occurred what is clear from this data is that fcov-1683 s cleaved with trypsin requires at least a mildly an acidic environment to fuse but the rate dependence on ph is negligible this may indicate that there is a mildly acidic ph threshold at which fcov-1683 s becomes fusogenically active as such we show here that acidic ph may be considered as a subtle trigger for fusion along with the better characterized triggers of receptor binding and proteolytic processing of s a second finding from these experiments is that trypsin can substitute for cathepsins in activating membrane fusion in the absence of trypsin treatment the total number of fusion events is less than 10 of the number of events that occur with treatment post acidification data not shown a third finding is that protease activation can occur before the virus binds the apn receptor in contrast to the situation with sars-cov where the virus must first be bound to the receptor before cleavage it is interesting to note that fcov-1683 is one of the coronaviruses that does not need to be cleaved at the s1s2 junction and so this result highlights that there may be differences in receptor priming of fusion depending on how individual coronaviruses are proteolytically activated the lag time between the onset of hemifusion and pore formation can be determined from the relative time stamps of the onset of hemifusion dequenching and the onset of the release of fluorophores initially inside the virion in fig 6
 a series of images of a dual-labeled trypsin-treated fcov fusing to the supported bilayer is shown in fig 6a with the intensity quantified in fig 6b the initiating ph in this experiment was 45 in fig 6b it is straightforward to determine the lag time as a difference between the dequenching spike of the green label and the drop in fluorescence of the red label lag times for the virions in this sample are cataloged and plotted in the bar graph in fig 6c fitting this histogram with an exponential decay we determine that the rate constant for the formation of the pore is 007  001 s1 pore formation was also conducted with an initiating ph of 50 here the rate constant for the formation of the pore is 009 s1 for both initiating phs the transition to pore formation histogram fit best to a one-step process these experiments reveal that fcov exhibits a distinct hemifusion event before the release of internal label which supports that coronavirus like influenza proceeds to pore formation via a stalk intermediate no release of internal red label was observed prior to hemifusion of dual-labeled virions with our results it is now also possible to compare the fusion kinetics obtained for cov s with the prototypical protein of this class influenza ha in our previous single particle kinetics studies of influenza x-31 ha membrane fusion 7 we found hemifusion and pore formation rate constants at ph 45 of k
h  02 s1 and k
pore  008 s1 respectively here for fcov s at the same ph we obtain k
h  005 s1 and k
pore  007 s1 respectively one main difference we observe between ha and s is the ph-dependence of the hemifusion rate constant fcov-1683 s apparently requires an acidic environment to fuse but the rate dependence on ph is negligible influenza on the other hand exhibits ph-dependent k
h
5 7 however the pore formation kinetics for both viruses is approximately the same this result is not surprising because the pore formation step is not believed to be ph dependent 43 44 but controlled to some extent by the physico-chemical properties eg lipid composition protein content cholesterol quantity etc of the membranes involved in fusion since cell blebs can be made from various cell types the method presented here for forming supported bilayers from blebs also provides a new way to interrogate the impact of cell membrane type on viral fusion kinetics a second difference between influenza ha and fcov s is the value of n obtained from the kinetic analysis n represents the number of steps in a multi-step scheme convoluted into a gamma distribution in the case of influenza n has been interpreted as the number of ha proteins that work in parallel to induce hemifusion 5 7 for influenza n varies depending on the ph but within the range of ph 40 to 60 is 3 using the same experimental acidification conditions employed in these studies in the case of fcov s if this interpretation was used our data indicates that on average 12 s proteins are required to induce hemifusion across the same ph range for this interpretation a single s protein appears to have more energy stored within it to induce fusion compared to ha an alternative interpretation is that n in this case simply means that 1 step is dominating the kinetics and that step apparently does not vary much with ph future experiments are required to shed more light on the mechanism of fcov fusion and provide a conclusive interpretation of this parameter such studies are now ongoing in our laboratory the formation of proteinaceous supported bilayers using the cell blebbing technique opens the possibility for quantitative characterization of membrane fusion kinetics of any enveloped virus that binds to membrane proteins in the host membrane beyond coronaviruses and also enables studies of unknown viral receptors in the cell membrane because supported bilayers can be made from many cell types 14 17 this method can be used to obtain kinetics of virus fusion as it depends on the kind of cell membrane host in particular for the many viruses that engage multiple receptors or co-receptors this method allows the role of individual receptors to be defined in the context of the fusion event through biochemical means proteins can be expressed or suppressed in the plasma cell membrane thus supported bilayers can be tailor-made for fundamental studies of specific host-pathogen interactions that mitigate infection in addition by the incorporation of pseudoparticles 9 the method may be expanded to study viruses of high biomedical importance that require enhanced biosafety procedures bsl-3 and bsl-4 in this work we obtain the membrane fusion kinetics of a less-studied but clinically important class i fusion protein coronavirus s overall the fusion results here recapitulate what is observed in vivo that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors and that membrane fusion is both receptor- and protease-dependent these results indicate that the in vitro method described here is a suitable substitute for studying fusion in vivo but our method of creating and combining proteinaceous bilayers with single particle tracking now provides a convenient way to obtain quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway which to our knowledge have not been obtained before the single particle approach combined with microfluidics offers versatile control over the sequence of triggers of binding protease exposure and acidification control of the sequence of these triggers is important as the order may define the fusion pathway tissue tropism and pathogenicity of coronaviruses systematically varying these complex triggers using this platform provides a new way to study this viruss ability to rapidly adapt to other hosts versatile platforms are of critical importance to providing data that can be leveraged to limit the infection of the human population especially in light of the recently-emerging strain of mers-cov  statistical issues and lessons learned from covid-19 clinical trials with lopinavir-ritonavir and remdesivir travis sanchez khairun nor aripin nain wenbin liang guosheng yin chenyang zhang huaqing jin   the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has spread all over the world at an unprecedented rate since its outbreak in december 2019 more than 200 countries or territories have confirmed cases and over 84 million individuals have been infected leading to more than 450000 deaths as of june 18 2020 covid-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization who on january 30 and declared a pandemic on march 11 2020 as recommended by the who rd blueprint expert group clinical improvements for patients with covid-19 can be classified in a seven-category ordinal scale 1 so far there are only eight clinical trials for covid-19 completed with results published among them two trials were for hydroxychloroquine with relatively small sample sizes 30 patients for the trial of chen et al 2 and 36 patients for the trial of gautret et al 3 although the trial conducted by gautret et al 3 yielded a significant result the sample size was too small to draw any convincing conclusion the trial of cai et al 4 compared favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir with a total sample size of 80 patients leading to a significant result p004 chen et al 5 conducted a trial comparing favipiravir with arbidol which had a total sample size of 240 patients and yielded an insignificant result the trial of grein et al 6 was a single-arm trial for remdesivir and the estimated clinical improvement rate at day 18 was 068 to determine the efficacy of lianhuaqingwen lhqw capsule a compounded chinese herb medicine hu et al 7 conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial and reported a statistically significant difference in the symptom fever fatigue coughing recovery rate between the treatment group and the control group 915 vs 824 p022 however the trial did not include a placebo in the control group to implement a double-blinding scheme despite the urgency nature of the pandemic their argument for unblinding due to ethical reasons seems to be unsound due to the conscious and subconscious psychological tendencies of humans including both clinicians and patients bias often arises in an open-label study not only does unblinding lead to potential selection bias but it may also cause placebo effects for patients who took lhqw 8-11 which thus shed doubts on the clinical benefits of lhqw in particular the rate of symptom recovery is related to disease relief or symptomatic manifestations such as fever fatigue and coughing soft end points for which placebo effects are known to be strong and more discernible 10 however the lhqw and control groups did not differ in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral assay findings hard end points for which placebo effects are less perceptible because generally placebos can neither alter the pathophysiology of the disease nor cure it we take the three randomized clinical trials conducted by cao et al 12 on lopinavir-ritonavir and by wang et al 13 and beigel et al 14 on remdesivir as examples to illustrate statistical issues and lessons learned as they have drawn great attention in the clinical community the lopinavir trial for suppression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in china 12 was conducted with record speed from january 18 to february 3 2020 the date of enrollment of the last patient patient recruitment up to a planned sample size is often the bottle neck of trial conduct this was not the case with severe covid-19 due to the abundance of hospitalized patients during that period of time in this trial eligible patients were randomized at a 11 ratio to either the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment group 400 mg and 100 mg orally twice daily plus the standard care or the standard care alone for 14 days no placebo was used for blinding because no placebo was prepared due to the urgency of the trial therefore both patients and investigators were aware of the treatment identity each patient received following the who seven-ordinal scale 1 the primary end point adopted by the trial 12 was the time to clinical improvement which was defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of two points from the status at randomization eg from point 6 to point 4 or from point 5 to point 3 or live discharge from the hospital whichever came first the sample size was increased from 160 to 199 since the result with the enrolled 160 patients did not reach statistical significance as a final conclusion cao et al 12 reported no benefit with the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond the standard care with a hazard ratio hr of 124 and the associated 95 ci 090-172 wang et al 13 conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial with remdesivir at ten hospitals in hubei china overall 236 patients were enrolled from february 6 to march 12 2020 and were randomly assigned to the remdesivir group 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 and the placebo group at a 21 ratio in the original design the trial planned to recruit 453 patients with 302 to remdesivir and 151 to placebo but no patients were enrolled after march 12 due to no eligible patients being available in the hubei province as a consequence the statistical power of the study was reduced from 80 to 58 the primary clinical end point was the time to improvement within 28 days clinical improvement was defined as a two-point improvement from an adjusted six-category ordinal scale from the who seven-category ordinal scale in conclusion remdesivir did not show statistically significant clinical benefit compared with the placebo in terms of the hr 123 95 ci 087-175 beigel et al 14 reported a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection this trial had a total sample size of 1059 patients 538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo the median recovery time of the remdesivir group was 11 95 ci 9-12 days and 15 95 ci 13-19 days for the placebo group the rate ratio for recovery was 132 95 ci 047-104 p001 which was statistically significant in favor of remdesivir the kaplan-meier estimates of mortality at 14 days were 71 with remdesivir and 119 with the placebo and the hr for death was 070 95 ci 047-104 remdesivir was shown to be superior to the placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and in terms of the hr for death there was no significant difference between the two groups so far only one treatment remdesivir has been shown to be effective by a randomized clinical trial but the other remdesivir trial failed to demonstrate its superiority over the placebo as the pandemic of covid-19 will not be controlled anytime soon the aforementioned three clinical trials 12-14 provide extremely valuable information on the treatments of covid-19 and the corresponding trial design and analysis however several important issues have been identified in the statistical analysis design and implementation of the three trials we point out the statistical problems that arose in the three trials 12-14 and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves for the time to improvement or recovery using more appropriate approaches our in-depth and comprehensive analyses yield new insights on the design and analysis for ongoing and future covid-19 clinical trials the log-rank test 15 is the most commonly used method in survival analysis and clinical trial design to compare the survival benefit of two arms consider a randomized clinical trial with a planned sample size n1 using a two-sided log-rank test if the hypothesis test indicates no significant survival difference between the two groups under the significance level  but the trial decides to continue to enroll more patients up to a larger sample size n2 this would inflate the overall type i error of the trial any adjustment to the sample size during the trial should be planned and evaluated in advance to maintain the overall type i error rate let z1 and z2 denote the log-rank test statistics with sample sizes n1 and n2 respectively it holds that under the null hypothesis 1617 z1 and z2 jointly follow a multivariate normal distribution d1  dn1 and d2  dn2 are the expected numbers of events with sample sizes n1 and n2 and d is the proportion of patients experiencing the event thus the overall type i error rate  overall with the significance level  is  is the 1  th quantile of the standard normal distribution for clinical studies with a survival end point we are interested in the distribution of event time t in general patients will eventually experience the event with a long enough follow-up although the exact event time might not be observed due to censoring however for some diseases with long-term survivors it may happen that the event will never occur in a fraction of subjects ie the event time for cured subjects is infinity 18-21 under this situation patients can be divided into two groups the terminal or cure group the specified event would never occur and the nonterminal group the specified event would occur but possibly censored due to the end time of the study thus the distribution of the event time t has a point probability mass  at   is the group label taking a value of 1 if the individual is in the terminal group and 0 otherwise   p  1  pt   is the terminal rate and t follows a proper distribution with pt    1 for the covid-19 trials 1213 the cumulative incidence curve of t can be expressed by ft and ft are the cumulative distribution functions of t and t respectively note that pt    1    1 restricted mean survival time rmst 1622-26 is an alternative measure for the mean survival time that is not estimable due to the presence of censoring the rmst is equal to the expectation of the minimum value of event time t and the specified time point  which can be calculated as the area under the survival curve from 0 to  it can be estimated by the area under the kaplan-meier survival curve which has gained enormous popularity due to its robustness feature although the hr is the most popular statistic to quantify the survival difference in randomized clinical trials it is no longer an interpretable quantity if the proportional hazards ph assumption is violated 25 by contrast the rmst has the advantages of being nonparametric and model-free yet carrying clinically meaningful interpretations given the prespecified time point  the estimate of the rmst difference between two groups can be interpreted as the extra survival gain on average during the time  follow-up period clinical trials during the epidemic of an infectious disease might fail to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients if the outbreak can be quickly controlled 27 however early termination of a clinical trial would inevitably lead to loss of power and thus unconvincing findings based on the collected data the bootstrap method can be used to predict what would happen if the trial had continued to reach the desired sample size let n denote the desired sample size and n0 n0  n the actual number of patients enrolled the statistic of interest prediction can be conducted under either conditional or unconditional schemes the unconditional prediction draws n samples sampling with replacement from the original data with n0 observations while the conditional prediction draws n  n0 samples from the original n0 observations and keeps the original n0 samples intact by repeating the sampling procedure for a large number of times one can estimate the predicted mean and the corresponding confidence interval for the statistic of interest if the trial had continued to reach the sample size of n in the original analysis of cao et al 12 the time to clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28 and failure to reach clinical improvement or death before day 28 were considered as right-censored at day 28 in contrast to the usual survival analysis where death or a bad event such as disease progression is used as the event of interest a good event clinical improvement was adopted as the end point in this trial as a result the shorter time to reach clinical improvement the better cao et al 12 concluded no benefit of using the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond the standard care with an hr of 124 95 ci 090-172 we carried out an in-depth and comprehensive investigation of the trial design in cao et al 12 and identified several key issues with the trial that might have hindered its success first the unplanned sample size increment from 160 to 199 would inflate the type i error rate for this trial we have n1160 n2199 d075 d1  160  075  120 d2  199  075  14925 and based on equation 2 overall071 when the nominal significance level is set as 05 that is the false-positive rate for this trial increased as high as 71 in contrast to the nominal level of 5 any sample size alteration or re-estimation should be planned in advance to control the type i error rate and maintain the integrity of a trial when the sample size reached 199 the trial was halted for enrollment because of the availability of another treatment remdesivir such termination of a trial was again unplanned and immature if there were not another agent available would the trial continue recruitment interestingly the remdesivir trial by wang et al 13 the same group of investigators as the lopinavir-ritonavir trial started 3 days later after the lopinavir-ritonavir trial was terminated in terms of the primary end point clinical improvement using two-level increment on a seven-category ordinal scale from baseline is ad hoc due to uneven clinical differences between adjacent scales for example it is ambiguous whether the status of a patient changing from point 5 to point 3 is equivalent to that of changing from point 6 to point 4 in addition live discharge from the hospital may occur from point 3 to point 2 or point 4 to point 2 which cannot be considered equivalent either thus choosing 2-point improvement on the clinical outcome scale is not a precise end point which ignores the 1-point improvement and the difference between 2-point and 3-point improvement instead we recommend death as a single and clean end point for such trials given the mortality rate was not low with patients who were hospitalized with severe covid-19 192 in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 250 in the standard care group the original analysis 12 treated death before day 28 as right-censored at day 28 no matter when death had occurred this may cause ambiguity because it cannot distinguish the situations where all deaths in one group occurred earlier while those in the other group occurred later as death is a terminal event a terminal or cure rate model would be more appropriate for analysis of such data a terminal rate model can be viewed as the counterpart of the traditional mixture cure rate model 18-21 which can be developed by slight modifications as death is a terminal event patients who died during the 28-day follow-up period would never reach the clinical improvement ie the time to clinical improvement was infinity denoted as  death can also be viewed as a competing risk for clinical improvement the upper panel of table 1 shows that there was neither any significant difference in the terminal rates between the lopinavir-ritonavir and standard care groups or in the hr after excluding the terminal subjects who would eventually be absorbed in the death state from the mixture terminal rate model in particular the terminal rates including observed deaths as well as unobserved deaths that would occur after day 28 but were censored at day 28 were 2117 for the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 2991 for the standard care group with p16 and the hr for nonterminal subjects was 105 95 ci 078-142 p74 moreover the crossings of the cumulative event curves for the lopinavir-ritonavir and standard care groups at days 10 and 16 in the second figure of cao et al 12 imply possible violation of the ph assumption when the ph assumption is not satisfied the hr from a cox model 29 is not clinically meaningful as an alternative the area above the curve in the second figure of cao et al 12 or the area under the inverted curve as shown in our figure 1 referred to as the restricted mean time to improvement rmti can be used to quantify treatment effect that requires no assumption such as ph 1622-26 as a model-free quantity the rmti up to 28 days can be interpreted as the average time to reach improvement in 28 days for which the shorter is the better the 28-day rmti difference between the two groups was 167 days 95 ci 362 to 028 p09 in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant the 7-day and 14-day rmtis are also presented in the lower panel of table 1 where the 14-day rmti showed some promising results for lopinavir-ritonavir yet further confirmation is needed tables 2 and 3 show the numbers on mortality and clinical improvement by day 28 across the two treatment groups respectively we carried out chi-square tests or fisher exact tests if some of the cell counts were smaller than 5 to examine any association between the outcomes and treatments for table 2 with 23 cells there is no association with p53 and if combining deaths in both earlier and later stages this leads to 22 cells with p32 and odds ratio 071 95 ci 036-140 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had 071 times odds to die by day 28 in comparison to those in the standard care group for table 3 with 24 cells there is no association with p11 and if combining all clinical improvement cases this leads to 22 cells with p53 and odds ratio 124 95 ci 064-240 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had 124 times odds to achieve clinical improvement by day 28 in comparison to those in the standard care group however none of the results are statistically significant wang et al 13 reported a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled remdesivir trial for patients with severe covid-19 based on an adjusted six-point ordinal scale of clinical status the primary end point was the time to clinical improvement defined as a 2-level decline from randomization similar to that in cao et al 12 in fact the two trials were conducted by the same group of investigators for which the shorter is the better patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir interferons and corticosteroids the hr between the remdesivir and placebo groups was 123 95 ci 087-175 indicating no significant difference overall 237 eligible patients were enrolled with 158 patients assigned to the remdesivir group and 78 patients to the placebo group under the intent-to-treat itt scheme the trial was stopped early and thus failed to reach the designated sample size 453 due to a lack of eligible patients similar to the trial by cao et al 12 deaths before day 28 were treated as right-censored observations at day 28 regardless of the actual occurrence time of deaths in wang et al 13 moreover a clinical improvement might not be observed due to death ie death is a terminal event and thus the terminal or cure rate model introduced earlier should be recommended for the survival analysis rather than the standard cox model the upper panel of table 4 indicates no significant difference in the terminal rates between the remdesivir and placebo groups in particular the terminal rates were 3149 for the remdesivir group and 4071 for the placebo group with p19 with the terminal subjects excluded the hr from the mixture terminal rate model was 092 95 ci 063-135 p67 which also showed no significant difference between the two groups due to the competing risk from death the end point might not be observed and thus the standard hazard concept is ambiguous and the hr does not have a meaningful interpretation anymore 30 in the second figure in wang et al 13 the curve for the cumulative improvement event of remdesivir is uniformly higher than that of the control indicating patients with remdesivir reached improvement faster than those in the control group the area above the cumulative incidence curve or equivalently the area under the survival curve up to 28 days in our figure 2 would be a reasonable quantity for evaluating the treatment efficacy using the reconstructed data from the second figure in wang et al 13 the rmti evaluated at day 28 was 2042 95 ci 1926-2157 days for the remdesivir group and 2131 95 ci 1973-2288 days for the placebo group as shown in the lower panel of table 4 the difference in rmtis was 089 days 95 ci 284 to 106 numerically favoring remdesivir but not statistically significant it can be interpreted that patients treated by remdesivir on average had an extra 089 days of improvement during the 28-day follow-up compared with those in the placebo group the 7-day and 14-day rmtis are also presented in the lower panel of table 4 and neither showed statistically significant results the trial was terminated without reaching the originally planned sample size 453 due to a lack of eligible patients with only 236 patients in the itt analysis the estimated hr was 123 95 ci 087-175 numerically favoring remdesivir which might not be reliable due to the underpowered study using the bootstrap method we can predict what would happen if the trial had continued to reach the full sample size or double the planned sample size table 5 shows both the unconditional and conditional predictions of the hr similar to sample size re-estimation using conditional power 31 in a two-stage design if the trial could have reached the designated sample size the hr from the conditional prediction shows the significant treatment effect of remdesivir with p02 and if the trial had enrolled twice of the target sample size both conditional and unconditional approaches result in significant differences under the 5 significance level thus a larger sample size may be needed to show the significant difference between remdesivir and placebo beigel et al 14 presented a preliminary report of the nct04280705 trial which is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement this trial enrolled 1059 patients 538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo the primary end point of the original analysis was the recovery time defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only the median recovery time of the remdesivir group was 11 95 ci 9-12 days and that of the placebo group was 15 95 ci 13-19 days the rate ratio of recovery for remdesivir vs placebo was 132 95 ci 112-155 p001 which demonstrated the superiority of remdesivir in terms of the hr for death there was no significant difference between the remdesivir and placebo groups with an hr of 070 95 ci 047-104 the remdesivir trial of beigel et al 14 is essential to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir as it had a large sample size of 1059 patients under a well-designed randomized controlled trial scheme in terms of the data analysis beigel et al 14 only reported the median recovery time without a p value from the second figure in beigel et al 14 the kaplan-meier curves of cumulative recoveries are initially intertwined and then diverge so other percentiles of the time to recovery would provide more information on the efficacy of remdesivir meanwhile a global and robust measurement the restricted mean time to recovery rmtr can help to quantify the treatment efficacy in a more comprehensive way 1622-26 the upper panel of table 6 presents the rmtrs up to day 30 for both the remdesivir and placebo groups the rmtrs were 145 days and 172 days for remdesivir and placebo respectively indicating that patients with remdesivir on average had 27-day gains of recovery with 30-day follow-ups the difference in rmtrs was statistically significant with p001 demonstrating the superiority of remdesivir this is consistent with the original analysis in terms of the rate ratio of recovery 14 meanwhile in the bottom panel of table 6 more percentiles of the time to recovery were reported with p values the early difference for remdesivir vs placebo in the recovery time at the 25th percentile was 1 95 ci 3 to 0 p65 which was not statistically significant however the differences manifested to be statistically significant later for example the 30th to 60th percentiles of the recovery time in the remdesivir group were all significantly shorter than those in the placebo group it is reasonable for the treatment to take effect after a certain length of follow-up when designing and conducting a clinical trial for new treatment particularly for the covid-19 pandemic without knowing much about the clinical outcomes many things can go wrong if the design is not well thought out the trial is not carefully conducted following the protocol or the analysis is not properly carried out critical issues with such trials include but are not limited to the end point selection the type i error rate control double blinding or open label early termination of a trial the validity of the ph assumption in a cox model and assumptions for statistical tests and models in contrast to searching for a needle in a haystack the trial design should be more targeted focused and tailored for specific needs of patients with covid-19 and particular disease characteristics and severities 32 given the emergency and the fast spread of the coronavirus around the world it is crucial to design the right clinical trial and accelerate the development of a new treatment with the high speed of enrollment and urgency of the trial outcome it appears to be difficult to carry out any adaptation during the trial conduct the trial outcomes unfold so fast that any adaptation may not be able to catch up with the speed of recruitment as a summary our recommendations for covid-19 trials are although adaptive design has gained much popularity and is playing an increasingly important role in clinical trials particularly in oncology the advantages of adaptive design may be mitigated to a large extent under such a fast patient enrollment because the impact of any adaptation may be too slow to manifest before the trial is completed in such cases the consort consolidated standards of reporting trials statement 3334 can provide a general guideline for the trial design and conduct as a result our recommendations follow the gold standard scheme of conventional trial design without much adaptation ingredient which may help investigators to discriminate different treatments and identify the effective ones in an efficient way  modeling covid-19 epidemic in heilongjiang province china tingzhe sun yan wang   in december 2019 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 occurred in wuhan hubei province and then unfolded in china and all over the world 1 the novel coronavirus has been a serious threat to public health 2 china has taken strict measures such as quarantine social-distancing suspicious isolation community surveillance to restrain covid-19 outbreak by late february however heilongjiang has now become the province with most diagnosed patients in china ie even worse than hubei province massive imported cases emerge and continue to increase specifically a recent super spreader or imported escaper in heilongjiang province has led to tens of diagnosed or asymptomatic cases 3 therefore evaluating the epidemic of covid-19 in heilongjiang province may help provide effective strategies to restrict covid-19 transmission recently many mathematical models have been constructed to investigate the epidemic of covid-19 some models have made modifications based on the conventional seir model 4 and concluded that strictly controlled interventions are critically important to impede covid-19 outbreak 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 several other model instead established a stochastic transition model to evaluate the transmission of covid-19 and also emphasized the necessity of interventions such as social-distancing isolation and quarantine 1213 meanwhile asymptomatic patients are covert cases which represent a serious threat to public health 14 a few models have been developed to evaluate the role of coronavirus transmission based on asymptomatic cases 111516 however all these models have ignored the covid-19 transmission from bats and unknown hosts a recently proposed novel model has characterized these interactions among bats unknown hosts and people in details 17 they estimated the basic reproduction number r0 to be 24829 and indicated that model is locally asymptotically stable if r0  1 17 these important models have greatly improved our understanding about the epidemic of covid-19 in current work we developed a mathematical model to characterize imported escaper and asymptomatic patients we trained our model based on covid-19 epidemic in heilongjiang province from january 23 to march 25 by which the last confirmed patient was cured in heilongjiang province using this model we performed stochastic simulations and found that partial relief in strictly controlled interventions may contribute to the occurrence of diagnosed patients recently from april 9 to april 19 provided that there is only one imported patient without surveillance 3 meanwhile we predicted that there is still an unidentified pool of asymptomatic patients we suggested that strict or mild interventions should still be implemented to restrain a potential covid-19 outbreak the number of experimentally confirmed patients and curedrecovered cases january 23 to april 19 was obtained from health commission of heilongjiang province httpwsjkwhljgovcn table s1 note that only domestic cases epidemiologically associated with the super spreader between april 9 and april 19 were recorded and simulated the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in heilongjiang province from national bureau of statistics 3771 million httpwwwstatsgovcn owing to closure of wuhan on january 23 there are no wuhan returnees to heilongjiang province since then the total population

 describes the discharge rate from quarantine i i1 2 3 describes the averaged contact rate between s and c a or i respectively specifically 1 is the average contact rate between susceptible population and close contacts 2 describes the average contact rate between susceptible population and asymptomatic patients 3 denotes the averaged contact between susceptible population and infected patients  denotes self-recovery rate for asymptomatic cases since specific asymptotic patients can recover without treatments 18 19 20 1 and 2 represent the transition rate from close contacts to asymptomatic and diagnosed ones respectively 3 is the transition from asymptomatic to diagnosed cases 18 19 20  is the maximum average recovery rate since the health-care capacity in different provinces differ significantly owing to economic development we further incorporated a threshold behavior for the recovery we assumed that higher numbers of inpatients and quarantined cases will lower the average recovery rate the health-care capacity will be improved if there are fewer diagnosedquarantined patients a hill function was used to characterize the threshold behavior the threshold was represented as a parameter k and the cooperativity effect was described by the parameter n see model 1 initial values for i and r were obtained from the official site httpwsjkwhljgovcn the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in heilongjiang province as described above other parameters and initial conditions c and a were estimated based on epidemic data from heilongjiang province for parameter estimation 400 stochastic runs using potterswheel toolbox 21 were implemented and the best fit parameter set was shown in table 1
 since the best fit for initial asymptotic population is 1 0042736 we set initial value for a to be 0 since a should be an integer we note that the parameter n in the best fit set was 102545 suggesting that the threshold behavior in recovery rate has relatively low cooperativity parameters were estimated by potterswheel using a trust-region method 21 a 2 criteria was used for model identification 2n1 n is the number of data points 21 we did not incorporate death similar to recent assumptions 1322 the -leap method was used for stochastic simulation 23 ordinary differential equations odes were numerically solved using ode23s in matlab r2018b the ksdensity function in matlab was used for kernel estimation the model was first trained with epidemic data from heilongjiang province using a reasonable initial guess we performed unbiased parameter fitting by sampling parameters in logarithmic scale totally 400 sets the top 200 fits were harvested we noted that fitted initial values from 200 top fits for asymptomatic patient number a approximated zero with mean value 01 and therefore the initial value a for is set to be 0 the best fit was shown for infected and recovered patients by march 25 figure 1
a notably the fitted i i1 2 3 values were to the order of 1010 to 109 suggesting that strong interventions were implemented to restrain mutual contacts table 1 meanwhile n is around 1 102545 suggesting that the cooperativity was neglectable the best fit parameter set was shown in table 1 we further estimated a dynamic reproduction number based on ordinary differential equations 24 the results showed that the reproduction number initially reached 50692 and then quickly dropped below 1 by feb 14 and finally reached 08702 figure s1 therefore our model could faithfully match the epidemic data in heilongjiang province and found that continuously strict measures indeed impeded the covid-19 transmission we then performed stochastic simulations using -leap method 23 since mutual contacts among different populations act as potential risk factors to covid-19 outbreak 25 all i i1 2 3 values were multiplied by a contact factor f i fi i1 2 3 therefore f1 indicated strongly controlled interventions as implemented between late january and mid-march while f1 represented mild or relieved interventions f1 was associated with strongly weakened or no interventions the imported escaper or super spreader the super spreader here means that all recently confirmed patients can be associated with this super spreader in an ongoing epidemiological study arrived in heilongjiang province at march 19 and was then subject to home quarantine 3 therefore the number of infected patients was increased by 1 at march 19 in the stochastic model however the home quarantine was failed as reported possibly owing to accidental egress by escalator or stairs 3 we modeled this by increasing f from 3 to 8 and then performed stochastic simulations results suggested that even a moderate relief would not lead to the reported local outbreak f34 and 5 figure 2
a increasing f to 6-8 however will result in possible matches between stochastic simulations and reported epidemic data black dots epidemic data colored curves stochastic simulations figure 2a the median values from 500 stochastic runs were shown for increasing f values blue curves figure 2b the shaded areas denote 25 and 75 quartiles therefore we predicted that the mutual contacts for the super spreader was significantly elevated to around 7 we further matched our simulations to the reported asymptomatic patients setting f7 stochastic simulation could match the epidemic data figure 2 however we noted a large gap between the simulated number of asymptomatic patients to the reported cases f7 figure 3
a since asymptomatic patients usually do not seek medical tests owing to lack of symptoms the reported number of asymptomatic cases may be lower than the actual number figure 3a 18 19 20 the underestimation was significant for f6 or f7 on april 19 dashed line the mean value figure 3b the discrepancy seemed to grow if intervention strength was not altered figure 3b these simulations implied that the unidentified asymptomatic patients might be another serious concern since the asymptomatic cases can also be contagious 18 19 20 since the confirmed patients have undergone an ongoing increase we then evaluated the effect of establishment of strict interventions since april 20 black dot figure 4
a strict interventions were implemented f1 or 2 since april 20 we measured the time to peak and the recovery time since april 9 at which the first reported domestic patient occurs in heilongjiang province 26 we found that roughly 33 days were used to reach the peak for f1 whereas for f2 the duration was increased to 53 days figure 4b and 4c left 80 days were required for total recovery if f1 whereas about 139 days were needed for f2 figure 4b and 4c right therefore these simulations suggested implementation of strict interventions is strongly required to impede a potential outbreak in this study we constructed a modified model which incorporated threshold behavior in recovery rate and asymptomatic patients with significant difference to seir model 4 however ongoing importation into china especially in heilongjiang province has been a serious threat recently furthermore the asymptomatic patients are not easily identified owing to lack of obvious symptoms 20 we estimated the influence of asymptomatic patients based on a data-driven model from heilongjiang province we anticipated that an area- or province-specific model may help unravel the underlying features of covid-19 epidemic from simulation we found that even one imported patient or super spreader reported recently can lead to up to  40 infected patients and unpredictable pool of asymptomatic patients till april 19 3 we anticipated that the relaxed home quarantine for this imported patient 3 is unsuccessful and has initiated a local outbreak potentially simulation suggested that the mutual contacts from the relaxed home quarantine might possibly increase to f7 compared with f1 for strictly controlled interventions the occurrence of the imported escaper might be ascribed to the significantly longer latent period 2 the weakened surveillance for covid-19 inpatient transfer in specific hospitals and the murky mismanagement for covid-19 tests 3 all these deficiencies may possibly lead to a secondary blockage of some hospitals and communities for haerbin city in heilongjiang province more seriously the associated pool of asymptomatic patients was underestimated from official report since asymptomatic patients are also contagious the potential impact of these covert cases should attract extensive attention as least about one month is still required if strict measures are immediately implemented therefore the imported escaper argues for further epidemiological investigations as well as strongly controlled interventions as more data are available our model could be used for analyzing these novel epidemic data liu et al recently constructed a model with asymptomatic patients 11 however asymptomatic populations in their model will eventually become diagnosedconfirmed patients with clear symptoms and are more likely to be pre-symptomatic 14 which is in stark contrast to recent definition ie asymptomatic patients were those who never develop symptoms 18 19 20 we modeled the covid-19 epidemic induced by one imported patient without strict quarantine lessons from the emerging diagnosed patients recently in heilongjiang province since april 9 should catch attention as they are epidemiologically associated with this imported escaper furthermore we recommended that the strict measures such as isolation home or centralized quarantine should be re-established especially in haerbin city of heilongjiang province to lower the risk of a potentially secondary outbreak finally our model could also be applied elsewhere with adjusted parameters to monitor covid-19 epidemic not required

elizabeth dubois azeem majeed  in a search to find effective treatments for covid-19 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have gained attention we aim to provide evidence to support clinical decision-making regarding medication for the treatment of covid-19 by carrying out a systematic review of the literature the electronic databases medline embase global health and hmic were searched up to april 2020 eligible study outcomes included extubation or patient recovery relevant data were extracted and analysed by narrative synthesis our results included six studies in the review of which four studies were of good or fair quality all eligible studies included were for coronavirus involving the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat common symptoms such as fever cough shortness of breath and fatigue outcomes most commonly reported were improved lung function viral clearance and hospital discharge strong evidence to support the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 is lacking fast track trials are riddled with bias and may not conform to rigorous guidelines which may lead to inadequate data being reported the use of these drugs in combination with other medications may be useful but without knowing which groups they are suited for and when they may cause more harm than good  as the covid-19 pandemic has streaked around the plant the pursuit for therapeutic options has developed at a fast pace coronaviruses are not new in the past two decades the virus was responsible for previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers yet despite this experience no clear treatment pathway had been agreed in some countries therefore this current pandemic of a variant novel virus has taken the world by surprise with the only option of delivering empirical treatment at the early stages until a vaccine is available in a search to find effective treatments for covid-19 chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine have entered the spotlight 1 current evidence comes from poorly controlled clinical trials demonstrating antiviral activity against severe-acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 2 systematic reviews of variable quality have started to appear focusing on current patients without looking at past evidence with other viruses of the same family 3  to date no systematic reviews have been published examining the clinical effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the current pandemic or of past treatment for patients with severe coronavirus respiratory infections past outbreaks of coronaviruses have documented some useful treatments including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine these compounds are used to treat malaria systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatic diseases chloroquine increases endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion and interferes with the glycosylation of

was demonstrated to be clinically achievable in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received 500 mg 6  the metabolism of chloroquine after oral administration occurs mostly in the liver its excretion is slow and maintains a plasma half-life of 25 to 10 days furthermore individuals with impaired or compromised liver function at baseline eg ventilated patients in itu with multiple fat-soluble infusions running are more likely to experience accumulation in-vivo and require close monitoring of liver function test and risk of liver failure the adult acute lethal dose of chloroquine is between two to four grams in ages 18 to 65 according to the wuhan institute of virology 7  the study does not to stop at what medication is appropriate but also requires knowing when it is better to start treatment from sars we know that clinical worsening of individuals in week 2 is apparently more related to immunopathological damage than to uncontrolled coronavirus replication 8 keyaerts et al 9 observed that chloroquine displayed significant anti-sars-cov activity 9  but that inhibitory capability sharply declined if not administered within five-hour post infection 9  yet advantages of chloroquine such as low cost and well-established safety could allow its use as prophylaxis in individuals at high risk such as healthcare workers 10  the aim of this research is to

this the couple achieved remission on different weeks as the course of the disease differed due to individual risk factors patient one had metastatic breast cancer and recent exposure to

13  dosage recommendations for adults from each of these sources vary depending on the severity of the cases based on the results of the study the authors conclude that because of its limited side effects availability and costeffectiveness the drugs should be worthy for fast track clinical trials for treatment of covid-19 however another systematic review by sarma et al 14 found that when compared to conventional treatment there was no difference observed in virological cure death clinical worsening of disease or safety the main benefit was that treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone resulted in a lower number of cases showing radiological progression of lung disease additional benefits included less days to temperature normalisation and lowered total cough days compared to conventional treatment the authors recommended that more data is acquired before making a definitive conclusion on the safety and effectiveness of the drugs the results of this systematic review indicate a positive trend favouring the use of chloroquine singularly or the combination of hydroxychloroquine with antibiotic therapy regardless of added bacterial infection at the beginning of the

that immunosuppression may actually enhance treatment effectiveness by the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine antibiotic therapy and darunavircobicistat in patients who started treatment

hydroxychloroquine fears exist that excess demand may lead to a shortage for people with other diseases who are currently taking these drugs 19  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are usually safe and well tolerated in normal dosage but can be extremely toxic in overdose potential adverse effects that should be considered before prescribing include prolongation of the qt interval especially in pre-existing cardiac disease or if combined with azithromycin hypo-glycemia neuropsychiatric effects drug-drug interactions and idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions 20  moreover chloroquine is not as widely available as hydroxychloroquine in some countries and is associated with greater adverse effects such as interaction with lopinavirritonavir resulting in prolongation of the qt interval 21

threat many factors may be involved in the transmission of this deadly disease but not muchsupporting data are available till now no proper evidences has been reported supporting that temperature changes can affect covid-19 transmission this work aims to correlate the effect of temperature with that of total cases recovery death and critical cases all around the globe all the data were collected in april and the maximum and minimum temperature and the average temperature were collected from january to april ie the months during which the disease was spread regression was conducted to find a non-linear relationship between temperate and the cases it was evident that indeed temperature does have a significant effect on the total cases and recovery rate around the globe it was also evident from the study that the countries with lower temperatures are the hotspots for covid-19 the study depicted a non-linear dose-response between temperature and the transmission indicating the existence of the best temperature for its transmission this study can indeed put some light on how temperature can be a significant factor in covid-19 transmission  diverse influence on peoples living environment in different parts of the world under differe nt climate conditions 4  sars-cov-2 the virus causing covid-19 is spreading like a fire in the forest it has affected more than 200 countries in a very short span of 3 months this deadly disease is having an intense influence on the health care system and economies of affected countries5 the overall mortality rate is projected to be 625  but rising to 60 in individuals aged 60 or above the disease is majorly spread to health care workers close family members and individuals near social contacts as predicted by researchers and doctors the major route of transmission of this deadly disease is through droplets close direct or indirect contact but the relative significance of these routes of transmission is presently not clear the lack of information can make it hard to find ways of prevention and control measures the world saw the first covid -19 case on december 12 2019 and soon within 3 months the world health organizationwho declared it as a pandemic in march6 thus this points out how easily it is spreading among the community and putting mankind in big suffering now this is going to another level of criticalness as it is in the third-and fourth-generation transmission ie faster human to human transmission till now there are not many shreds of evidence how temperature can be a guiding factor in the virus transmission or what could be an appropriate range for the same so a big question which is rumoring all around the world is whether the temperature is at all having any effect on the spread of this deadly disease there may be some more important or deciding factors for transmission of this virus namely humidity factor of different countriesplaces immuniza tio n programs of different

rate deaths and critical cases all around the globe the relation is indeed a non-linear indicating that there is a typical favorable temperature that might be contributing to the transmission results do suggest that regions having low temperatures are more prone to infection than that of the regions with higher temperatures although several other factors like hospital facilities governme nt awareness medical facilities should also be considered along with the temperature apart from this immunity is also playing a major factor in transmission the population with higher immunity is less affected thus we can say that the emergence of the outbreak throughout the world may be narrowly related to the respective local temperature but other important factors are also playing a crucial role in the spread and control of the disease temperature only affects the rate of spread and recovery we can conclude that countries and regions with a lower temperature must take more serious steps and

infection in children worldwide 1 with the key
risk group being young infants 2 no vaccine is
currently available for this age group development of alternative control strategies
depends on the mechanisms of transmission which are intrinsically related to viral shedding
3 4
detailed data on shedding in individuals in relation to age infecting subtype groups a or
b infection severity and gender would help in identifying the source of infant infection
such data from the natural setting unaffected by sampling bias are limited and absent in
resource-poor settings additionally this study assesses the impact of the presence of
other respiratory viruses prior to or concomitant with rsv on rsv infection duration any
interaction might be mediated through direct interference or host immune and physiological
responses these possibilities have received very little attention in the literature previous studies on rsv shedding have been mainly in the hospital setting limiting the
generalizability of the results 3 5 6 hospital
studies are biased to young children with severe rsv disease and fail to precisely establish
the start and often the end of shedding particularly when symptoms do not coincide with
virus shedding which is common for rsv 6
community-based studies are likely to provide a more complete representation of the rsv
shedding patterns such studies require frequent nasopharyngeal swabbing regardless of
symptoms and use of sensitive molecular techniques for viral testing in order to minimize
the likelihood of missing infection episodes especially in older age groups the current prospective study utilizes the above approach with intensive sampling every
34 days molecular testing and follow-up of individuals of all ages for one complete rsv
season in a rural kenyan community 7 this
provides for more realistic estimates on duration of and influencing factors on rsv shedding
which are required in designing rsv prevention strategies and to better understand the
impact of vaccination on rsv transmission dynamics nps were collected and tested for rsv groups a and b and other respiratory viruses

multiplex pcr as described previously 7 in
order to establish the genetic similarity of the rsv strains in suspected repeat
infections the ectodomains of the rsv attachment g protein gene were sequenced and
analysed phylogenetically 9 the authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical
standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation
and with the helsinki declaration of 1975 as revised in 2008 data were analysed using stata version 112 statacorp usa the infection data were
interval-censored and three possible durations of viral shedding were estimated ie
minimum midpoint and maximum as described in the supplementary online material and shown
in figure s1 an rsv infection episode was defined as the period within which an
individual provided specimens which were pcr positive for the same infecting rsv group
with no more than 14 days separating any two positive samples episodes where the first
sample was positive for both rsv groups a and b counted as one infection episode episodes
where no samples were collected for 7 days before or after the infection episode
were considered left- or right-censored respectively symptomatic infection was defined
as the presence of one or more of the following symptoms cough nasal dischargeblocked
nose or difficulty in breathing at any time during the infection episode co-infection
was assigned when within the rsv episode any sample was pcr positive for another virus
ie coronavirus rhinovirus or adenovirus presence of these viruses in the samples
collected in the period of 14 days prior to start of rsv episodes was also defined
household outbreak was defined as a period within which more than one individual episodes
occurred in members of the same household without an interval of 14 days in which a
pcr-positive specimen was absent from the household the proportion of the household
members infected during household outbreaks measured the intensity of the outbreak cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors influencing the rate of
loss of virus detection hereafter referred as the recovery rate the effect of
left-censoring was accounted for in the multivariate model by including a dummy variable

54 days with median of 28 days for the 17 homologous infections sequencing of the rsv g
gene was successful in 10 59 of the 18 possible pairs of samples one individual had
three suspected rsv episodes the failure to sequence was mainly in samples with a pcr

only one of the successfully sequenced paired samples showed nucleotide differences 13
nucleotide differences associated with three non-synonymous changes and a change in the
stop codon position the episodes in this individual id no 1803 in fig 2 occurred 54 days apart for the purposes of estimation of the

compared to 78 days in asymptomatic episodes the presented average durations of virus
shedding are longer than published estimates of 67 days 4 3474 days 10 39 days 11 and 45 days 12 which could be attributed to differences in study methods the present study was
informed by critical review of the previous studies and it incorporated frequent sampling
regardless of symptoms and screening by highly sensitive pcr methods the specimen
collection procedure was acceptable recording a good compliance across all ages 7 13 the use
of the sensitive viral detection method pcr results is likely to result in longer
estimates of shedding a community study nested within a birth cohort in coastal kenya targeting symptomatic rsv
infections by okiro and colleagues reported a mean duration of shedding of 45 days 12 our corresponding estimate in symptomatic cases
was 135 days in a subset of the children whose start of symptoms could be established from
the clinic records the okiro et al study reported a longer duration of
77 days 12 given that rsv shedding has been
reported to start before illness 6 the actual
duration in the symptomatic children would have been an underestimate and our estimate of
135 days is likely to be more accurate a rochester family study in the usa with similar
design as the present study collecting samples every 34 days regardless of symptoms
reported lower estimates of duration of shedding of 3474 days 10 the okiro et al and rochester study used the
immunofluorescent antibody test ifat and culture respectively which are less sensitive
methods 14 as a counter argument it is not
known to what degree pcr positivity equates with shedding of viable and infectious virus
thus while the molecular methods might be more sensitive the resultant increase in
duration of shedding over more traditional methods such as culture which directly measures
viral infectivity may not necessarily translate to increased period of infectivity further
work relating virus infectiousness and detectability is warranted in the okiro et
al study sampling started when participants were symptomatic and stopped at the
first negative follow-up sample the present study revealed instances where negative samples
arose within rsv infection episodes even though this observation raises again questions
on the relationship between infectivity and shedding duration accounting for periods of
rsv-negative samples would still result to longer shedding duration compared to previous
estimates alternative estimation of the shedding patterns by calculating the area under the
ct viral load curve would have some additional advantages and will be
explored in future prolonged shedders of  3 weeks duration have been reported 6 10 in the present study
24 134 episodes in the 179 infected individuals involved shedding rsv for 3
weeks most 22 917 of these episodes were symptomatic and occurred in young children
median age 147 months individuals with compromised immunity have been known to shed rsv
for longer 15 but participants in the current
study were not tested for hiv the hiv prevalence in women and men aged 1549 years in
coastal kenya was 42 according to the kenyan demographic and health survey of 20082009
16 in settings where hiv prevalence is high
the effect of the poor viral clearance might influence the temporal epidemiology as was
observed in south africa 15 there was no obvious
malnourished participant in the study cohort based on mid-upper arm circumference
measurements more than two rsv episodes were observed in 24 134 individuals on average the
episodes were 4 weeks apart most 708 of the suspected repeat infections were with
homologous rsv group sequencing of the most variable region of the rsv genome the
ectodomain of the g gene did not greatly assist in resolving the infection episodes as most
910 had identical sequences it is thus not clear whether the two phases of rsv
shedding were repeat infections with the same variant or were persistent infection with
periods of low viral load that was undetectable by the methods used using post-mortem lung
tissue from infants rsv rna has been detected even in children dying during inter-epidemic
periods suggesting the persistence of rsv in the lungs of these infants 17 similar observations have been made in
experimental infection with rsv 18 and measles
viruses 19 the lack of variability in the virus
identified in the two phases of infections suggests virus mutation might not be the primary
mechanism for virus persistence or re-infection regardless of whether it is re-infection
within a short period or persistence the observation represents an interesting phenomenon
of rsv which has potential importance on our existing view of acute rsv infection the
development of immunity and effects on viral transmission the age of the individual infection severity detection of other viruses before and during
the rsv infection and presence of concurrent rsv infections in the same household were all
associated with virus shedding the rate of recovery increased with increasing age with
individuals in 14 years 515 years and 15 years age groups recovering 198 182 and 197
times faster than the infants respectively the rochester family study reported similar
findings where longer shedding was observed for children aged 2 years compared to
those aged 216 years 9 vs 4 days the okiro et al
study did not find any association with age but found that children with previous rsv
infection using the assumption that those aged 3 years were by default experiencing
a repeat infection had 137 times faster rate of recovery compared to those without a
history of infection 12 in the present study a
subsequent rsv infection during the same rsv season was not significantly associated with
reduced shedding duration but such infections were few n  24 the
current study is for one epidemic only so age must act as a proxy of exposure to rsv in
earlier epidemics prolonged shedding enhances the possibility of person-to-person
transmission and makes young children a potential source of community spread of infection
both of which have important implications in the control and prevention of rsv infection a study involving 23 hospitalized children aged 2 years with sampling extended
beyond discharge reported an association of duration of shedding and symptom severity 4 children with lower respiratory tract infection shed
for longer than those with upper respiratory tract infection 84 vs 14
days duration of shedding may be related to severity of disease but evidence is
controversial on the link between disease severity and viral load 5 2022 an interaction between detection of other viruses ie coronavirus rhinovirus
adenovirus in the nasopharynx and rate of recovery from rsv infection was observed
recovery from a viral infection just prior to rsv might have led to up-regulation of innate
viral immunity or non-specific cross-reactivity that reduced subsequent rsv shedding
presence of co-infections might be a marker of low immunity associated with poor viral
clearance rsv episodes with concurrent spread in the household were associated with
increased recovery rate however any conclusions other than association cannot be made
since the extended duration of shedding increases the risk of both co-infection with other
viruses and multiple rsv infections in the household a different estimation framework is
required to untangle these results the problems of ascertainment and analysis ie censoring and test sensitivity are not
completely eliminated by the careful study design but did not seem to affect the
association of the examined factors with virus shedding supplementary table s1 short rsv
infections occurring between specimen collections particularly in older individuals might
have been missed but this is likely to be at random and bias hazard ratios towards null in conclusion this study defines rsv shedding patterns in the natural setting with
significant potential for improved understanding of the spread of this important virus and

prattes abubaker suliman ahmed al suwaidi rami al-rifai h harald sourij ingrid keilegom van  background many studies investigating mortality and recovery in covid-19 have been published recently the majority of these studies used the standard cox proportional hazards cox ph model without taking into account the presence of competing risks this study investigates through extensive simulations the bias in estimating the hazard ratio hr of death due to covid-19 and the absolute risk reduction arr when competing risks are not taken into consideration and suggests an alternative method we simulated data for a fictive clinical trial in covid-19 patients to mimic recent trials involving the use of hydroxychloroquine remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy for example the primary outcome is the time from randomization until death due to covid-19 six scenarios representing different situations of the effect of treatment on death and its competing event recovery were considered the hr of death and the 28-day arr were estimated using the cox ph model and the fine and gray fg model which takes competing risks into account the estimates were then compared to their corresponding true values and the magnitude of misestimation quantified the cox ph model misestimated the true hr of death in the majority of the scenarios the magnitude of this misestimation increased when the process of recovery was faster andor the chance of recovery was higher in some cases this model has also incorrectly shown a harmful effect of treatment when it was in fact beneficial the true 28-day arr of death was also misestimated and this misestimation increased in magnitude when the process of recovery was faster the results obtained from the fg competing risks model are all consistent and show no misestimation or changes in direction for both the hr and the 28-day arr of death there is a substantial risk of misleading results in covid-19 research if recovery and death are not considered as competing risk events we strongly suggest the use of a competing risk approach to re-analyze relevant published data that have used the cox ph model  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the cause of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has affected nearly 120 million people in over 190 countries and caused more than 546000 deaths as of july 07 2020 1  numerous retrospective or prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials rcts were conducted to evaluate different therapeutic interventions 2 3 4 5 6 7  the results of these studies have not only impacted treatment strategies in covid-19 patients but have also influenced health-policy decision making including continuation modification or termination of the use of some of the studied drugs the recent rcts involving the use of hydroxychloroquine remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy are some examples to cite 3 5 7 the statistical methods commonly used in these studies to investigate primary outcomes such as in-hospital mortality or recovery are based on the standard cox proportional hazards model cox ph and the kaplan-meier estimator 8 9  when in-hospital mortality due to covid-19 is the outcome of interest these two methods implicitly treat recovered patients as right-censored similarly when recovery from covid-19 is the outcome of interest these two methods consider patients who died as right-censored this way of proceeding is not appropriate since it implies that patients who recovered respectively died have similar risk of death respectively recovery compared to those still at risk ie still hospitalised in fact death and recovery investigated in several of the previously reported studies on covid-19 are mutually exclusive competing events and therefore recovery respectively death should be considered as a competing risk for death respectively recovery rather than right-censored a competing risk is an event whose occurrence precludes the

be interested in overall death from any disease as opposed to death due to covid-19 then a competing risk approach would not be necessary since recovery is in that case not a competing event but is rather censoring the event of interest however in clinical trials on covid-19 or other diseases the important question for patients and regulators is about which treatment regimens help in preventing death due to that particular disease of interest hence death due to covid-19 is the outcome of interest in covid-19 studies rather than overall death despite the abundance of statistical papers recommending the use of survival models that account for competing risks 13  these models are still underused in many medical studies especially in covid-19 related research the main objective of this study is to investigate through extensive statistical simulations the bias that occurs when estimating the hr and other quantities of interest such as the absolute risk reduction arr using the cox ph model in the presence of competing risks the fine and gray fg modeln 14 which takes competing risks into account is also used as an alternative to the cox ph model in this simulation in-hospital

both treated and placebo groups the estimated 28-days arr defined as the difference between the two quantities will be zero and therefore hides this mis-estimation this is illustrated in figure 4

and chance of recovery both affect the quality of the hr and the 28-day arr of death estimated from standard cox ph model it also shows that the fg model that takes competing risks into consideration performs largely better than the cox ph model and provides estimates with no bias our simulation strongly suggests that ignoring competing risk in survival analysis would affect the quality of the

direction as compared to the true hr as demonstrated eg in figure 1 scenario 6  in studies where the chance of recovery is high cox ph models will display a falsely increased hazard ratio of death in particular if time to recovery is short while the true hazard ratio for death is reduced the use of a standard cox ph model to investigate the association between a potential treatment and the risk of in-hospital mortality or recovery implies that all other events apart from the primary outcome are considered as right-censored observations more specifically when hospital discharge or recovery is the primary outcome considering patients who died as right-censored assumes that they are still at risk of being discharged during the rest of follow up period similarly when in-hospital mortality is the primary outcome considering patients who recovered at a given time point as right-censored implicitly assumes that they have similar risk of dying from covid-19 as those who are still at risk ie hospitalized at that time point since a considerable proportion of covid-19 patients are discharged alive ie recovered the concern of competing risk is inevitably of significant relevance looking at currently published randomized controlled trials investigating potential treatment for covid-19 most of the studies do use standard cox ph models our simulations suggest that it would be helpful to confirm the findings of these trials with a competing risk analysis approach as the true effect of the studied drug for example on death may be mis-estimated or even reversed in the recently published preliminary results from the recovery trial for example the primary endpoint 28-day mortality rate in the hydroxychloroquine arm was met in 257 and in the placebo arm in 235 and lead to an estimated

the dexamethasone and 611 in the usual care group respectively again a rate that could have impacted the results although the simulation approach in our study was helpful to investigate the interplay of various hazards on death and recovery as well as time to recovery and to suggest a potential impact on currently ongoing covid-19 research we appreciate that we did not analyse actual trial data of

 limited knowledge is available on prevalence severity and recovery time of these disorders in sarscov2 patients the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and severity of smell and taste disorders in a population of laboratoryconfirmed sarscov2 patients a secondary objective was to investigate the onset and recovery time from the same symptoms smell and taste assessment were reported using data from the scales which have been treated as quantitative real values categorical variables were reported as a proportion while quantitative variables as median and 2575 quartile range where appropriate comparison of the baseline worst and 14days smell and taste perception was performed using friedmans test all statistical analysis has been performed using r 363 r core team 2020 r a language and environment for statistical computing r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria a pvalue 05 was considered significant two hundred and thirtyseven 237 66 patients reported a change in smell perception greater than two points between their baseline smell and the worst smell experienced during the infection of these 128 54 reported the smell dysfunction already present at the time of diagnosis these patients had a baseline smell perception of 10 9 10 range 310 with the worst smell perception during the infection of 0 02 range 07 at 14 days from infection 115 495 of patients declared a full recovery with smell as good as at baseline while the remaining 122 declared a certain degree of remaining deficit with an overall population perception of 8 610 range 010 variation of smell perception at different study period is presented in figure 1a one hundred and fortynine 629 patients reported full recovery at the time of the interview with a median recovery time of 10 715 range 125 days no patient reported taking any specific therapy for their disorder two hundred and thirtytwo 654 patients reported a change in taste perception greater than two points between their baseline taste and the worst test experienced during the infection these patients had a baseline taste perception of 10 9 10 range 510 with the worst taste perception during the infection of 0 02 range 010 at 14 days from infection 117 504 of patients declared a full recovery with the test as good as at baseline while the remaining 115 496 declared a certain degree of remaining deficit with an overall population perception of 8 610 range 010 variation of taste perception at different study period is presented in figure 1b one hundred and fortyeight 638 patients reported full recovery at the time of the interview with a median recovery time of 10 715 range 225 days no patient reported taking any specific therapy for their taste disorder figure 2 shows the daily rate of recovery for both smell and taste disorders over the last weeks an increasing number of authors reported a high rate of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in covid19 patients sometimes presenting as the first symptom

 the main goal of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of smelltaste disorders in a large covid19 positive population composed of patients who were either asymptomatic or presenting mild or moderate symptoms our findings 66 and 654 respectively without gender differences are similar to those of yan et al about a smaller sample of 59 positive patients
10
 a recent european multicenter study reported higher percentages both for smell and taste disorders with a female prevalence
12

 since only one study by mao et al referred to the prevalence of chemosensory impairment in asiatic covid19 population 5
9
 our data seem to corroborate the hypothesis by lechien et al that western positive patients usa and europe may be more subject to the development of olfactory and gustatory disorders
12

 the majority of patients in this study complained of complete anosmiaageusia confirming the observation that covid19 related impairment tends to induce a severe olfactory and gustatory dysfunction
10
 
12

 of particular interest is the analysis of the timing of anosmia the loss of smell was noted in 54 prior to diagnosis and appeared as the first symptom in 13 of cases recent onset of olfactory disorders may drive the physicians to treat these patients as possible covid19 positive adequate precautions for the health care practitioners pcrtesting and home selfisolation are crucial measures to avoid that such patients continuing to accidentally act as vectors of the disease another pivotal issue of the research regards the recovery of olfactory and gustatory functions 495 of patients reported a full regaining of both senses after 14 days since the beginning of the symptoms and this percentage improved to 629 at time of interview 23 days median range 1531 with a median recovery time of 10 days obviously even if our follow up is longer than other reports

 it remains too short to give a conclusive interpretation regarding the prognosis although the exact mechanism with which sarscov2 could impair smell and taste has not been definitively determined two hypotheses appear to be plausible damage to the olfactory epithelium due to cell expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors which act as a binding point for the virus
16
 or a direct assault on the olfactory neurons
17
 the relatively rapid and spontaneous recovery of most patients in the current and in other studies tends to suggest an epithelial based pathogenesis given the capability for the epithelium to quickly restore its functions after damage
10
 
11
 
12

 according to some authors the presence of 15 variants of the ace2 gene explains many ace2 polymorphisms and differences in expression between european and asian populations this finding could be a cue to investigate if different patterns may influence susceptibility and clinical features of covid19 infection
18

 the current study presents some limitations shared by all similar researches first of all the patients did not undergo nasal endoscopy specific imaging or objective smell assessment these examinations would contribute to a better understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and to define some prognostic factors about the functional recovery second the evaluation tool was a selfreported smell and taste score it has been previously demonstrated that subjective evaluation of sense of smell is quite specific but less sensitive than objective testing
19
 moreover the survey was rapidly developed by the authors with the aim of collecting and sharing the most possible data in the shortest time after such emergency contingency additional validation is needed third even if our population is quite numerous the sampling time was short and limited to a single center future studies on larger samples can help to clarify the prevalence of anosmiaageusia in covid19 patients lastly no patients in this study received specific treatment for olfactory or gustatory loss currently no medical treatment has proved to be highly effective in postviral anosmia
20
 
21
 
22
 the potential risks of immunosuppression with the use of oral and some topical steroids also need to be borne in mind consequently we agree with most authors who recommend against specific therapy

 a different approach could be applied to those patients with persistent olfactory disorders after complete recovery from covid19 and an exhaustive smelltaste assessment in any case further studies are needed in order to investigate potential benefits of treatment in selected cases beyond the limitation this is one of the first studies to provide the prevalence the onset time the severity and the recovery time of covid19 related smell and taste disorders the followup time is acceptable and the sample is various and quite representative novara indeed is a small city 100 000 inhabitants near the border with the lombardy region the epicenter of the italian covid19 outbreak at accrual timemarch 30ththe positive patients in the town were almost 800 of which 355 were enrolled in the current research the current study strongly confirms the high prevalence of olfactory and gustatory disorders in covid19 infection

system recovery after a pandemic the impact of the coronavirus disease2019 covid-19 pandemic response phase has already exceeded the capacity and capabilities of most city regional state and national health care delivery systems there are clinical non-clinical and support staff who are assigned to attend non-covid-19 patients in the acute care setting but the overwhelming majority of staff has been consumed in acute care hospitals for the covid-19 response some have fallen ill or have had to be quarantined the breadth of the toll of a prolonged acute covid-19 pandemic response on the well-being and mental health of staff has yet to be appreciated and addressed non-acute care staff or acute care staff who typically do not attend to pneumonia or sepsis patients with skills that can be adapted to the acute covid-19 care environment have been redeployed from their usual practice settings with just-in-time education throughout the world government restrictions have canceled postponed or limited by priority primary and specialty care visits additionally the fear of acquiring the severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus 2 sars-ncov-2 has kept people away from their health care providers1 in the united states this has reduced health care system revenue specifically the decrease in elective surgical endoscopy and other procedures across the united states and in most other countries there has been a marked decrease in emergency department visits and subsequent admissions that have decreased hospitals bed census to open space for covid-19 patients during this slow developing pandemic mass casualty incident this has also decreased revenue2 hospitals have been adhering to the mass casualty surge capacity theory to limit or postpone elective surgery and imaging services and to also free in-patient beds and imaging services for the acute covid-19 response this has also decreased revenue in the united states there is a growing number of health care delivery systems that have furloughed clinical non-clinical and support staff deemed not essential to the acute covid-19 response to reduce the impact of projected future revenue loss3 the staff affected by this health care delivery service disruption remain available to return to their duty stations non-acute covid-19 staff redeployed will likely remain redeployed as the duration of acute care can range from days to weeks post-acute care covid-19 patients who are too weak to go home or require oxygen who have not been cleared of the sars-ncov-2 virus have few options to transfer out of an acute care bed they may need physical therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation the spoke-and-hub system is functioning in most health care delivery systems with those acute covid-19 patients who require a ventilator and other intensive care unit management being transferred to tertiary level acute care or alternative site hospitals the reverse triage process is less functional in most health care delivery systems where the post-acute care covid-19 patients are transferred to acute care hospitals that can manage these patients staff and stuff will still have to be devoted to these facilities stuff has been consumed at an alarming rate with materials taken from non-acute clinical settings their storage and their contracted-to-be-delivered materials have been redistributed to the acute covid-19 hospitals supply lines have been disrupted from raw materials to finished goods with industries retooled to devote their output for the acute covid-19 response alternative covid-19 care sites have been adapted to function for an extended period of time in non-acute care structures wards clinics offices displacing this clinical office and treatment space for an unknown period of time the collective attention of health care administrators has been focused on their systems acute pandemic response the acute covid-19 pandemic will persist until a vaccine has been created properly tested without political exigency and administered to create sufficient population immunity there will be an untold and unpredictable number of short-term rises in patients with an acute covid-19 infection these will be mere ripples and will not approximate the spanish flu of 19181919 or modeled covid-19 projections due to the populations compliance with masking social distancing and hygiene the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic is coming the second wave will comprise patients with chronic illness who have patiently waited to reschedule or schedule their primary or specialty care appointment to refill medications obtain durable medical equipment and undergo surveillance laboratory or imaging studies to gauge effectiveness of titrated therapy this will include patients who have waited and have symptoms signs and other indicators of a serious illness that requires a timely diagnosis to maximize effective treatment this will include the patients with mental illness or substance abuse who have had their outpatient treatment routines disrupted while doing their best to accept their individual family and community stress eventually these patients will need care and like the covid-19 response there will be an exponential curve of presentations and consequences of delayed care the second wave also there will be post-acute covid-19 patients with an unknown post-acute pathophysiology who will require longitudinal care some may require supplemental oxygen for extended periods with a new or adapted pulmonary rehabilitation the current acute covid-19 health care delivery incident command system will remain in place albeit contracting and expanding in relationship to the ongoing local response guided by the runkle et al4 study from 2012 a secondary surge after a pandemic has parallels to that after a sudden onset disaster the time is now to stand up a recovery health care delivery system this would include the post-acute covid-19 patients who require ongoing care and the primary and specialty health care delivery system that has been canceled postponed or limited the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic will include the patients who have had their primary and specialty care delayed there are published post-acute sudden onset disaster response health care system studies after hurricanes typhoons floods tornadoes a superstorm tsunami and nuclear

 time is of the essence to continue the pandemic disaster cycle with a comprehensive post-covid-19 health care delivery system recovery analysis plan and operation at the local regional and state levels  temporal and spatial characteristics of the spread of covid-19 in rio de janeiro state and city douglas ferreira s r paula ferreira f r s paulo oliveira s l jennifer ribeiro elicardo goncalves a s andrs papa r r  from the first cases detected in wuhan china of infections by the disease of the new coronavirus covid-19 until the present moment of this pandemic millions of people have already been infected and hundreds of thousands have died worldwide the way in which the virus has been dispersed in brazil and more specifically in rio de janeiro is the motivation of the present work our studies consist of analyzing temporal and spatial characteristics of the spread of covid-19 in the municipalities of the state of rio de janeiro and in the neighborhoods of the state capital based on open data published by the health departments of governments of the state of rj and the municipality of rio de janeiro covering the period from february 27 2020 to april 27 2020 for that we use analysis of time evolution graphs and mappings of spatial distributions and statistics analysis of spatial correlation our results suggest that the initial stages of spreading the virus across the state occur exponentially with specific regions with a higher concentration of rates of cases deaths and recovered people in addition our qualitative and quantitative results for the data considered point out that the regions with the highest income average per capita have higher rates of confirmed cases and recovered people however the regions of higher lethality do not are found in these places with several of these regions of high lethality in places of low income per capita our results reinforce the idea of creating specific and strategic plans for policies to combat the spread of covid-19 in the various localities in rio de janeiro  in december 2019 in wuhan city province of hubei china several cases of pneumonia the unknown were reported more than half of the patients with such infection has been in the huanan seafood market a place identified as the starting point for the new coronavirus covid-19 1 2 3 4  due to its high transmission rate which reached china and several countries in a few weeks on march 11 2020 the world health organization who stated that the new covid-19 infection would pass to be characterized as a pandemic 1  in brazil all states of the federation already report confirmed cases of which so paulo and rio de janeiro are the ones with the largest number of infections and deaths by covid- 19 rio de janeiro is the state with the second largest number of confirmed cases and deaths due to the covid-19 pandemic according to data from the ministry of health 2  it is worth mentioning that rio de janeiro is a state of great importance within the brazilian scenario having the second largest economy in the country and one of the most globalized cities in the world rio de janeiro is an industrial hub and shelter headquarters of several multinational companies covering food metallurgical steel with emphasis on the oil extraction and refinement sectors the tourist sector in rio de janeiro raises billions of brazilian reais per year and part of its capital was declared in 2017 as heritage of humanity by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco as a result of such circumstances the flow of people is high a factor that probably contributed to the sustained transmission of covid-19 and its rapid dissemination highlights also the fact that covid-19 can also be disseminated by asymptomatic individuals which makes it more difficult control 3 5  even after the recent work by cavalcante and abreu 6  published on april 22 2020  there is still a shortage of scientific studies about the epidemic evolution of the outbreak of covid-19 in the state of rio de janeiro thus in the present work temporal and spatial analyzes of the dynamics of distribution of confirmed cases recovered people mortality rates and lethality rates due to the new coronavirus are developed in these analyzes we take into account the places where contagions were recorded as well as demographic characteristics like population size and per capita incomes thus using statistical methods of space correlations we developed an exploratory data analysis that are distributed in space but that evolve over time making it possible for us to look for association patterns between different regions and socio-economic conditions therefore this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of how contagion has evolved spatially and temporally in the population of the state and the municipality of rio de janeiro especially in the initial periods of its dissemination since our studies use data that include information until april 27 2020 in order to make this work as self-contained as possible we present in this section some characteristics and epidemiological information about covid-19 sars-cov-2 is a human coronavirus in the group coronavirus belonging to the coronaviridae family and like other family members it is an enveloped positive rna virus it was identified for the first time on january 7 2020 7  and it is likely that it first appeared in malaysian pangolins manis javanica and later passed to humans with bats serving as a reservoir for the virus 8 9 10 3  infection of this new coronavirus namely is triggered by the binding of the virus spike s protein to the converting enzyme angiotensin 2 ace2 which is highly expressed in the lungs and heart 11 12  sars-cov-2 invades especially epithelial cells of the alveoli explaining why the disease is characterized mainly by respiratory symptoms 11  covid-19 has a fast dispersion and its transmission occurs by droplets or aerosols of saliva at the time of sneezing coughing or talking and direct contact with saliva or respiratory system secretion of a sick person even if asymptomatic 13 14 15  the virus can still be found on contaminated surfaces including plastics fabrics and wood 2  which can become indirect means of contagion 13 10  yet samples of the sars-cov-2 genetic material can be also found in feces thus the fecal-oral route may become a possibility of transmission and dissemination of the virus 16  such factors contribute to the rapid dissemination and spread of covid-19 in view of these aspects until the date of writing of this paper across the planet the cases confirmed has reached 4 million people with 270 thousand deaths the epidemiological data from covid-19 for the state and the municipality of rio de janeiro were obtained on april 30 2020 through the free access databases of the health department of the government of the state of rio de janeiro 3 and 3 httppainelsauderjgovbrmonitoramentocovid19html the health department of the municipality of rio de janeiro 4  these data cover the period of february 27 2020 to april 27 2020 however we emphasize here the fact that not all municipalities and neighborhoods have data until the 27th of april since not all city halls update their data often because each one has its peculiarities and specific difficulties in our study data from confirmed cases deaths and recovered people were used it is worth noting that the criterion adopted by the health department of the state government of rio de janeiro to calculate the number of recovered people considers all confirmed cases that after 14 days from the notification date or symptom onset date are not hospitalized and did not die in the present work we will adopt the same criteria for obtaining and analyzing our recovered data with a population of 15989929 people according to the last census conducted in 2010 by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics -ibge and an estimate of 17264943 of in 2019 5  the state of rio de janeiro has 92 municipalities of which as of april 27 78 municipalities had at least 1 confirmed case of infection by the virus the municipality of rio de janeiro had a population of 6320446 people according to the 2010 census and an estimate 6718903 people in 2019 6  where among the 163 neighborhoods belonging to the municipality 153 had at least 1 person proven to be infected with covid-19 by 27 april it is worth mentioning that among the 92 municipalities in the state the city of rio de janeiro was chosen for the study because for the data we collect it concentrates more than 65 of the confirmed cases of covid-19 from across the state as well as 60 of deaths through getlio vargas fundations social policy center we also obtained the distribution of population average income per capita of each municipality in state 7 and of each neighborhood in the municipality of rio de janeiro 8  as previously mentioned in the present work we perform temporal and spatial analyzes of the cases of covid-19 in the population of rio de janeiro for this we use three different approaches where the prospects despite different are complementary to each other using epidemiological data acquired in the municipal and state health services secretariats we carry out the construction of graphs of time evolution of numbers of infected people deaths both in mortality and lethality and recovered people these analyzes allow observing the functional behavior of the spread of the virus as time goes by as well as take a more detailed and meticulous look about the local differences that exist in each region since it is expected that regions with different characteristics socio-economic conditions also have different contagions dynamics once the behavior of people in these regions will be different such different behaviors include from the frequency with which people in these regions travel to other locations away from their homes going through their type of work and even the form of driving transport that these people use as reported in literature different contagious diseases such as measles cachumba and rubella spread through the population with the number of infected in the initial epidemic phases growing exponentially 17 18 19 20  that is obeying a temporal function which has the form where yt is the total number of the epidemiological quantity measured at time t and b is a constant that depends on the contact rate between individuals and the recovery rate or death of individuals according to previous studies using data from brazil and the most diverse locations around the world the dissemination of covid-19 has a similar behavior that is some kind of exponential growth for the total number of infected people in the early stages of the epidemic outbreak 21 22 23 24 25 26  as a result several of our time evolution graphs will be presented in semi-log scales causing data that has growth exponential to be represented by an increasing straight line in this scale in this way our analyzes will us allow to observe how the data regarding the population of rio de janeiro state and city behave from the association of epidemiological and demographic data of rio de janeiro we will use spatial mappings of covid-19 distributions for confirmed cases mortality lethality and recoveries that occurred in the state and in the municipality of rio de janeiro these analyses of spatial distribution take into account both the epidemic factor confirmed cases deaths or recoveries and the social-demographic factor population and per capita income of each municipality or neighborhood this method seeks to perform a visual qualitative and quantitative analysis of how the outbreak of covid-19 behaves through the spatial and social organization of the fluminense population that is this method has the objective of studying for the outbreak of covid-19 possible existing relationships between different locations and different population distributions and incomes one scientific method of wide applicability in the most various areas of knowledge is the statistical analysis of data obtaining mining characterizing and systematic analysis of data based on well-defined statistical criteria is one of the branches of science that allows us to diagnose the past understand the present and infer possible future scenarios the characterization of epidemiological data disseminated in a region implies relationships between the epidemic agent and its association with the local space where a fundamental aspect of this spatial exploratory analysis is the numerical characterization of spatial dependence however as expressed in 27  human perception alone is not rigorous enough to determine patterns of significant spatial groupings thus in the present work we will use a statistical method capable of assimilating these associations and extracting spatial autocorrelation using quantitative instruments and not just visual observations in order to quantify spatial autocorrelations between the epidemiological agent and the incidence sites we will use morans i statistic this statistic provides a formal indication on whether the value observed at each point is similar or distinct from the values observed at neighboring points that is it measures the degree of linear association between a vector of values observed and the weighted average of the values of its neighbors 28 29 30  morans i statistic presents itself as a coefficient of spatial autocorrelation using a measure of auto-covariance in the form of a cross product varying from 1 to 1 31  mathematically morans i statistic can be expressed by where n is the number of regions considered x is the value of the variable of interest i and j are the regionsx is the average of the values observed of the variable of interest and w i j are the matrix elements of spatial proximity weights ie w i j is a measure of spatial proximity between regions i and j as a result positive values of i indicate a direct correlation negative values of i indicate an inverse correlation and i0 indicates no spatial correlation furthermore the much the closer to 1 is the i module the greater the intensity of the existing spatial correlation and the closer to 0 the lower the intensity an efficient way of interpreting morans i statistic is using the moran dispersion diagram where the index i is given by the linear regression coefficient on a graph to the value of the variable of interest in a given region of the space and the average of the values of this variable for neighbors of the considered region with that this diagram is divided into four quadrants which correspond to four levels of association between the region considered and its neighbors the quadrants i ii iii and iv respectively represent regions high-high low-high low-low e high-low however when analyzing a spatial distribution in a map it is important be able to detect local clusters regions with similar characteristics that is detecting significant clusters in regions of the map for this it is important to carry out local measures which in this case means using morans i statistic defined by  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 19 2020  in the present work we will use the calculations of the local values of morans i to carry out the local indicators of spatial association lisa 28  it is worth mentioning that morans i statistic was also used as a tool in other previous works on analysis of spatial correlations in the spread of diseases such as dengue and tuberculosis in the state of rio de janeiro 32 33 34  in accordance with the previous section we will carry out spatio-temporal analysis of covid-19 data in rio de janeiro from the perspective of the three methods presented it is important to highlight here the gap between the day of data collection and the time that they represent due to several problems for example time for database updates and time for examination results the data presented in the catalogs always refer to a past time and not to the present time in which they were extracted this means that our data although they were obtained on april 30 2020 actually refer to a previous time a time that is not necessarily the same for all municipalities since each municipal health department has its own problems and therefore different lags yet such difficulties do not preclude the present study since even if there are lags in the disclosure time of data the behavior is the same for the analysis of the temporal evolution of the spread of the disease the data from covid-19 and the data on demographics of the population of rio de janeiro were used in order to minimize possible problems related to daily records epidemiological data the analyzes presented in this work are calculated based on accumulated data and are not daily data only in order to carry out analyzes at different levels of spatial detail data were analyzed for three levels of regional scales the state as a whole municipalities of the state the neighborhoods of the municipality of rio de janeiro the results are presented below considering the entire state fig 1 presents the evolution of confirmed cases mortality lethality and recovered people across the state of rio de janeiro rj these graphs are constructed based on the first confirmed case and the first death in the state occurred respectively on february 27 and march 12 2020 according to the open data information from the health department of the government of the state of rio de janeiro figs 1a 1b 1d 1e provide respectively the evolution of the rate of confirmed cases mortality lethality and people recovered throughout the state for every 100 thousand inhabitants these graphs are presented in both a linear graph and in a semi-log one so we can observe clearer how the data behaves since an exponential function becomes a line in a loglinear graph in the graph of fig 1a we can see that we have two exponential periods until the 30th day the data obey an exponential function whose adjustment for eq 1 provides a coefficient b  016  001 with coefficient of determination r 2  0993345 between the 30th and the 50th days of the chart the best adjustment occurs for b  010  001 with r 2  0995657 for the mortality graph  fig 1b  two exponential behaviors arise the first for an interval before the 20th day and the second for an interval after the 20th day the coefficient b adjustments for these two intervals are respectively 019  001 with r 2  0991273 and 011  001 with r 2  0999107 fig 1d shows the rate of people recovered for each 100 thousand inhabitants of the state adjusting the exponential functionl 1 to data it is obtained a value of b  013  002 with coefficient r 2  0996678 by the figure inset in loglinear scale it is observed that the exponential function is better adjusted for the interval between days 35 and 52 in fig 1 e we have the curve for the time evolution of the percentage recovered in relation to confirmed cases or recoveredconfirmed cases it can be seen that for the state as a whole this percentage grows significantly exponentially from the 20th day until the end of the considered data the best fit is obtained for a coefficient b  00550001 with r 2  0987921 it should also be noted that although the graphics do not maintain their exponential behavior until the end of the data this change does not necessarily indicate that exponential behavior ceased to exist in that interval of time because despite the points no longer follow the exponential function there is a lag in collecting and releasing the data making the data to be corrected only a few days after the release and with that the last days of the catalogs lack data producing a greater incompleteness of data at the end of the time interval considered in fig 1c we have the evolution of the lethality rate of the virus in the state of rio de janeiro we observe that after the 30th day of the first death in the state lethality reaches a plateau approximately constant with a value just above 8 it is worth noting here that in the present work all calculations of lethality rates are carried out in accordance with the method adopted by the brazilian ministry of health 9  where the rate lethality of people by covid-19 is measured by the ratio deaths  total confirmed cases instead of considering the ratio deaths  ratio total completed cases this measure was adopted to make possible to compare our results with those of different locations from the country however although the graphics contained in fig 1 include throughout the state they have the limitation of not being able to identify the characteristics due to the particularities existing between different regions of the state and for that reason they will be presented later in analyzes of smaller regions divided by municipalities and also by neighborhoods 9 httpcovidsaudegovbr 4  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

in order to produce a greater spatial detail of the dissemination phenomenon of the new coronavirus within the rio de janeiro state we will present the analysis of confirmed cases mortality lethality and people recovered for the municipalities in the state an observation to be made is that for the analysis of municipalities it will not be presented errors related to parameter b of eq 1 nor the coefficients of determination r 2  this is because all analyzes are made for large numbers of municipalities and therefore it would not make sense to place the adjustment values for all cases in this way the b values presented are the measures of the angular coefficients of straight lines shown in the inset graphics  confirmed cases fig 2 shows the evolution of cases confirmed for the municipalities of rio de janeiro in this figure results are presented for the 20 municipalities with highest number of cases for every 100 thousand inhabitants with the objective of observing the growth trend of confirmed cases in each municipality more clearly we also used the semi-log scale where it can be noted that several municipalities have similar trends characterized by the line present in the inset of fig 2 thus despite the municipalities dont behave in exactly the same way we can observe the presence of the exponential form represented by eq 1 in the growth behavior of the num-ber of confirmed cases in the municipalities of the state of rio de janeiro by the inset with log-lin axis in the figure we are able to fit a straight exponential that meets an average behavior of several municipalities for the interval approximately between the 20th and 40th day this adjustment is obtained for b  010 as noted in section 511 despite the graphs of the inset in fig 2 have a change in behavior beginning between 40 and 50 days this change does not indicate necessarily that exponential behavior has left to exist in that time interval because although the points no longer follow the same behavior of the crescent line the lag in the collection and release of data results in data incomplete which are corrected only later  deaths to analyze the spatial distribution of the evolution of deaths due to the new coronavirus the rates of mortality and lethality by the virus in the populations of each municipality of the state were calculated fig 3 shows the results for the 10 municipalities with the highest death rates it is worth mentioning that in our calculations only municipalities with more than 6 confirmed deaths were considered such measure was adopted in order to minimize statistical problems since populations that are small compared to the average may have high mortality and lethality rates although for example have 1 or 2 deaths fig 3a shows the time evolution of mortality in the municipalities that is the number of deaths per every 100000 inhabitants in each municipality it can be noted that in this case the 5  cc-by-nc 40 international license

adjustment of a straight to the semi-log graph the best adjusted value for the coefficient b is 014 in addition it is observed that two municipalities stand out in relation to the others being duque de caxias and rio de janeiro duque de caxias in addition to having greater mortality still stands out for maintaining the exponential behavior until approximately the 35th day the temporal evolution of the lethality rate in the municipalities is described in fig 3b  in this case we have for each municipality the analysis of the number of deaths in relation to the number of confirmed cases of infection using the same calculation explained in section 511 in this way we are able to verify that the municipalities of maca and duque de caxias stand out when compared to other municipalities having at the end of the considered period lethality rates equal to 437 and 194 respectively these values being well above the value of 8 found for the state of rj in addition we observe that after the 30th day most municipalities start to have an approximately constant lethality with a value between 4 and 14  recovered the rate of people recovered per 100 thousand inhabitants of each municipality is shown in fig 4a  in fig 4b it is represented the fraction of people who have recovered from infection in relation to the number of people who were confirmed to be infected in both cases the results are for the 20 municipalities with the highest rates of recovered we emphasize again that all people who have been confirmed with the virus are considered recovered and after 14 we emphasize again that there are considered as recovered all people who have been confirmed with the virus and after 14 days their clinical picture did not evolve to hospitalization or death a direct analysis of the graph in fig 4a  shows us that the volta redonda municipality is highlighted in relation to others not only for having a higher rate of people recovered but also for having a faster growth rate of this rate we still have that the inset of fig 4a indicates that the behavior of the recovery rates of some municipalities also follow an exponential since these have the behavior of the line indicated in the figure even if just for a short period of days the adjustment of the line shown in figure inset has b  010 the graph of evolution of the rate of recoveries per case fig 4b  presents a scenario where the variations between the municipalities are very large and do not have a regularity pattern however we can observe that the behavior of data from the municipality of rio de janeiro have great similarity with fig1e  thus it is observed that the municipality of rio de janeiro has great influence on the behavior of this graph for the 6  cc-by-nc 40 international license it

b  0043 another result observed in fig 4b is that between the days 35 and 50 niteri has a recovery rate per case above other municipalities de janeiro in order to achieve a regional investigation even more detailed we will present below the results for neighborhoods in the municipality of rio de janeiro however we emphasize that for the neighborhoods it was not possible to carry out the analyzes of temporal evolution of deaths due to covid-19 as the free access data made available on the municipal health department website does not have information about the dates of deaths  confirmed cases similar to what was done for the municipalities of rj we have in fig 5 the number of confirmed cases per 100 thousand inhabitants for the neighborhoods of municipality of rio de janeiro this figure shows the results for the 20 neighborhoods with the highest rates of confirmed cases it is observed that the neighborhoods located in the southern part of the city have higher rates of confirmed cases the only exception is the bonsucesso neighborhood which after the 40th day showed an abrupt growth greater than all other neighborhoods the exponential behavior presented in the inset is better followed by the neighborhoods in the southern zone with adjustment for b  0051  recovered results for the rate of recovered people per 100 thousand inhabitants of the neighborhoods of rio de janeiro and the recovery rate in relation to confirmed cases are shown in the graphs of fig 6  in both cases data are displayed for the 20 neighborhoods with the highest recovery rates the neighborhoods with the highest recovery rates are in the southern of the municipality of rio de janeiro the inset in fig 6 a allows us to observe the exponential expansion behavior of several neighborhoods with an adjustment b  0050 in fig 6b  despite the irregular and heterogeneous behavior between neighborhoods it is also possible to notice a pattern for the interval after day 35 the line adjusted in the inset has b  0031 indicating that for this interval the exponential behavior is more modest than the for the others for neighborhoods in the municipality of rio de janeiro we considered recovered all persons who have been confirmed with the virus and after 14 days were not listed as hospitalized or as a death in accordance with the method described in section 42 we will present here a spatial

neighborhoods in the municipality of rio to achieve this objective we will use each of the measures of epidemic rates in conjunction with the data obtained of per capita income values for each municipality and neighborhood used such analyzes will be made as explained below cumulative data number of confirmed cases mortality lethality and recovered people will be overlaid on heat maps of per capita income distributions which will be built on geographic maps of the considered regions all maps presented in this section are maps of spatial distribution for accumulated data where the 10 municipalities with the highest rates per 100 thousand inhabitants are highlighted and named in all cases the sizes of the circles in red grow according to the rate values and the heat map varies from white to blue according to the local average per capita income considered the maps presented in this section were built using the qgis software 10  it is worth mentioning here that spatial distribution maps in general have more data than time evolution graphs this is due to the fact that not all data available in the databases of the health secretariats have the date of occurrence in this way it is possible to use these undated data for the construction of the maps however it is not possible to use them for time plots  confirmed cases in fig 7 we have the distribution of cases confirmed by 100 thousand inhabitants for each municipality in the state the map shows the 10 municipalities with the highest confirmed cases indexes where we can see that the municipality of rio de janeiro does not occupies the first position even though it has a much larger population than all other municipalities it should also be noted that the municipalities of iguaba grande and sapucaia despite having only 15 and 9 cases confirmed until april 22 2020 where these data were obtained on april 30 respectively occupy the fourth and seventh positions respectively this is due to their low populations it can also be observed that most concentrations of cases occur in the vicinity of the municipalities of greater per capita income in the same way it is noted that the northern part of the state when compared to the rest of the state has a low rate of confirmed cases in its population  deaths as with the time evolution graphs the analysis of deaths is divided into two calculations an observation to be done is that in order to avoid statistical anomalies in the results only the municipalities which registered more than 6 deaths in the considered time interval were considered fig 8a shows the spatial distribution of the rate of mortality for the municipalities where the 10 municipalities with the highest rates are highlighted in line with what was observed in section 512 the municipality of duque de caxias has the highest mortality rate in the state of rio de janeiro the lethality rate is shown in fig 8b  where again the municipality of duque de caxias ranks first and

observation to be made is that among the 10 municipalities with the highest lethality rates 5 of them occupy the lower half of the per capita income stratum duque de caxias so gonalo so joo de meriti

municipalities belonging to the lower income quartiles per capita only 3 of these municipalities appear among the 10 municipalities with higher recovery rates occupying the positions numbers 5 8 and 10 when considering the map of recovery rate by confirmed cases fig 9b  we have the same situation it is observed that these results are substantially different from those found for mortality and

being in the 5th position had only 2 confirmed cases on the collection date of our data however because it has a very small value compared to the average ends up being between the neighborhoods with higher rates of cases per population  deaths as in the case of municipalities we will use in our calculations only neighborhoods that have more than 6 deaths in our data the mortality rate is illustrated on the map in fig 11a  in this figure we can see results different from those found for the rate of confirmed cases given that for the mortality rate only 6 high-income municipalities are

8 it is also observed that the neighborhood that occupies the highest lethality position is in the municipality of santa cruz where the average per capita income of population falls into the lowest income group in the maps of fig 11  similarly to what happened for the analysis of municipalities there are dissonant results between the mortality-lethality rates from the results found for confirmed case rates  recovered fig 12a represents the spatial distribution for the number of people recovered per 100 thousand inhabitants in the municipality of rio de janeiro following a behavior similar to that presented for the number of confirmed cases 9 neighborhoods belonging to the highest per capita income group are among the 10 neighborhoods with the highest rate of people recovered the exception is the bonsucesso neighborhood yet all 10 neighborhoods belong to the top half of the quartiles per capita income the map of people recovered rate in relation to the number of confirmed cases is shown in fig 12b  in this case the neighborhoods with the highest income per capita represent 6 of 10 neighborhoods with the highest recovery rate by confirmed cases however 9 of these 10 neighborhoods belong to the upper half of the per capita income distribution groups it is noted therefore that as occurred for municipalities these results are considerably different from those found for mortality and lethality rates as described in section 43 one of the methods of producing a better understanding of the spread of a disease in a given region is the search for spatial correlations through quantitative methods we will present here results regarding the use of statistics morans i applied to our epidemic and regional data in order to check for local and regional correlations and the significance of the similar values found we also apply in our data the local association method lisa local indicator of spatial association for making maps and calculating the respective indexes b

statistical analyzes of spatial correlation at two levels of spatial aggregation for the municipalities of the state of rj and for the neighborhoods in the municipality of rio de janeiro rj since morans i statistic needs the distribution of weights assigned between each region and the neighbors considered for this region we present in fig 13 the histogram of distribution of numbers of neighbors for the municipalities of the rj state to calculate this histogram we used the neighborhood form with queen-type contiguity criteria 35  this histogram provides a measure of the number of neighbors that each municipality has the statistical analyzes will be presented below using the division by confirmed cases deaths and recovered  confirmed cases for the municipalities of the state of rj the morans i presented a value equal to 0371 indicating the b figure 12  a people recovered per 100 thousand inhabitants for the neighborhoods in the municipality of rio de janeiro b ratio between the number of people recovered and confirmed cases for neighborhoods in the municipality of rio de january in both cases empty circles represent locations with less than 20 confirmed cases of covid-19 the 10 neighborhoods with the highest rates of people recovered in the municipality are presented existence of significant spatial autocorrelation between municipalities in view of the positive value of index i we have a direct correlation between regions that is we can observe that locations with high rates of confirmed cases tend to be close to other locations that also have high rates and low-rate locations tend to be close to neighborhoods with low rates too this result is evidenced in the dispersion graph of morans index i fig 14a  with predominance of points in quadrants i and iii applying the lisa method autocorrelations were observed with the presence of spatial clusters and significant statistic the cluster map and the significance map shown in figs 14b and 14c expose these results the maps indicate the formation of a large cluster of confirmed casualties rates for covid-19 in upstate and a highrate cluster in the region close to the greater rio however we can see that the municipalities of seropdica and saquarema are found in low-high regions that is despite having low rates of confirmed cases they are close to municipalities with high rates making that the risk of growth in the number of cases in these regions become higher conversely we have the municipalities of aperib and bom jesus do itabapuana presenting themselves as regions high-low type since they have high case rates confirmed but their neighbors have low rates  deaths morans index i for death rate due to the coronavirus in the municipalities of the state of rj did not indicate the existence of spatial autocorrelation since the value found i  0059 indicates a spatial independence given that the value is close to zero likewise the map of clusters -lisa did not identify the presence of autocorrelations between municipalities as no relevant statistical results were identified for the spatial correlations between municipalities the graph of dispersion for morans i index and lisa maps will not be presented here  recovered similar to cases of death there is not the presence of spatial correlations between the municipalities in rio de janeiro regarding the recovery rates of people infected with covid-19 in this case the index i of moran presented result i  0014 where again we have the indicative of spatial independence the cluster map -lisa also doesnt identify the presence of autocorrelations between municipalities for recovered people ity of rio de janeiro for morans i statistical analysis applied to the dissemination of covid-19 in the neighborhoods in the city of rio de janeiro we initially present the distribution of the numbers of neighbors for the neighborhoods the histogram shown in fig 15 was calculated using the queen contiguity criterion for the neighborhood shape 35  one observation to be done in this statistical analysis is that the municipality of rio de janeiro has two neighborhoods that do not have neighbors see fig 15  in this way these two neighborhoods are excluded when performing the statistical calculations performed in the following steps  confirmed cases the spatial distribution of confirmed cases of covid-19 in the neighborhoods

in which regions with high rates of cases tend to have neighborhoods that also have a high rate and neighborhoods with low rates tend to be close to other regions with low rates the lisa method applied to confirmed cases for neighborhoods of rio provides the maps shown in figs 16b and 16c  where the presence of spatial clusters and significance results is observed figs 16b and 16c show a large cluster of neighborhoods with high rate of confirmed cases of covid-19 high-high located in the region that has the highest income per capita neighborhoods of the municipality in addition a large cluster of low rate low-low regions is located in the western of the municipality the exceptions are the neighborhoods of olaria and cascadura which also present themselves as regions low-low type but are located outside the western zone when observing the neighborhoods of itanhang and vidi-gal one can notice that both have low rates of confirmed cases however they are surrounded by neighborhoods with a high case rate and therefore present themselves as low-high regions these two neighborhoods do not fall into the category of neighborhoods with higher average per capita incomes the centro neighborhood is the only one present in the high-low category that is it has a high rate of cases confirmed for covid-19 immersed in a region where its neighbors have low rates it should be noted that a result similar to this one of cases confirmed for the neighborhoods of rio de janeiro was found in 6  using data between march 6 2020 and april 10 2020  deaths similar to what happened for state municipalities the death rate for neighborhoods in the municipality of rio de janeiro showed no spatial correlation considering that the moran index i obtained was equal to 0007 indicating therefore a spatial independence between the neighborhoods also the cluster map for the death rate of rios neighborhoods did not identify a significant amount of clusters as to indicate the presence of spatial autocorrelations between the neighborhoods with that the scatterplot for index i moran and lisa maps will not be shown here  recovered results for the rate of recovered people are similar to those found for confirmed cases the moran index i found was 0547 indicating also the existence of significant spatial autocorrelation between the neighborhoods of rio de janeiro with regard to people recovered of covid-19 infection the concentration of points in quadrants i and iii of fig 16 d again reflects the correlation between neighborhoods in relation to the rate of recovered similar to confirmed cases the lisa method presented a large high-high cluster in the region of higher per capita income maintaining the vidigal neighborhood as a region lowhigh and another large low-low cluster in the area west with olaria also remaining in a region of this type however for the rate of recovered the neighborhoods of coelho neto barros filho and itanhang present themselves as zones

medrxiv preprint in order to obtain quantitative results regarding the existence of spatial correlations between the rate of confirmed cases and the average per capita income of the neighborhoods we perform the bivariate moran i statistics using these parameters as two income variables cases and income the same procedure was done for the rate of people recovered in relation to neighborhoods per capita income the results are shown in figs 17a e 17b  where it is possible to observe that morans index i is equal to 0529 for the covid-19 confirmed case rate and equal to 0573 for the rate of recovered people indicating direct positive spatial correlation between these rates and average income per capita of the neighborhoods thus confirming what was previously presented that is for the data considered in the present study the neighborhoods with the highest per capita income are correlated to greater numbers of cases and people recovered while the lower middle income neighborhoods are correlated to fewer cases and people recovered in the present work we first analyzed the evolution of confirmed cases of covid-19 death rates and rates of recov-ered people where death rates were divided into mortality and lethality rates and the rates of recovered people were calculated per 100 thousand inhabitants and for confirmed cases these analyzes were made under three levels of regional scales namely for the entire state for the municipalities and neighborhoods in the municipality of rio de janeiro our results point to an exponential behavior in the early stages of dissemination of rates of confirmed cases of mortality and also for recoveries at all levels of scale state municipalities and neighborhoods it is worth mentioning that these results corroborate studies about the dissemination of covid-19 in brazil and other regions of the world as well as for other contagious diseases 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24  in addition it was observed that some municipalities such as duque caxias and rio de janeiro have mortality rates considerably higher than the other municipalities with duque de caxias still having a high lethality rate which behaves in an approximately as a constant from the 30th day on at the same time the municipality of niteri for a time span of 15 days has a rate of recovery cases markedly higher than other municipalities considering an exponential spread such as for covid-19 an interval of 15 days in which there are high recovery rates can mean many lives saved  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available

was that in our analysis duque de caxias presents itself as the municipality with the highest mortality and lethality in the state of rio de janeiro regarding the municipality of rio de janeiro it was observed a strong trend of confirmed cases and recovery rates in the south of the municipality at the same time for the lethality rate among the 10 largest neighborhoods only 1 belongs to the southern part of the municipality the last method used was the analysis performed through the morans i statistics in order to obtain spatial correlations between the municipalities of the state and between neighborhoods in the capital of rj for the municipalities a significant direct spatial autocorrelation was observed in which it is confirmed that northern municipalities tend to be cluster low rates of cases of covid-19 and the municipalities close to the greater rio tend to form high-rate clusters for neighborhoods in the municipality of rio a strong space autocorrelation was also found in which the municipalities of the southern part of the state concentrate most of the high-rate cluster while the western zone concentrates most of the neighborhoods of low rates although the three used methods are independent it is observed that their results are reinforced and complemented by each other it can be highlighted for example that all three methods point to the fact that the higher average income per capita regions tend to be places with a higher number of cases confirmed covid-19 and recovered persons this result was also confirmed for the fourth time with the use of morans bivariate i statistic pointing to a strong spatial correlation between locations with higher case rates and recovery and neighborhoods in the municipality of rio de janeiro with higher per capita

contribute in the analyzes of creating specific strategic plans in municipalities and even in the neighborhoods for an effective and efficient fight against spread of the new coronavirus  main factors influencing recovery in mers co-v patients using machine learning maya john hadil shaiba   the devastating marks left by infectious diseases on human race are much similar to that caused by famine and war 1 majority of the infectious diseases are caused by viruses bacteria or fungi coronaviruses are a family of viruses responsible for causing diseases ranging from mild infection to death causing diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars since the advent of the 21st century there has been a surge in the discovery of new coronaviruses such as sars co-v hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 etc 2 the detailed medical analysis on the death of a 60-year-old man in saudi arabia led to the discovery of a novel coronavirus 2 which was later coined as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers co-v the incubation period associated with the viral infection ranges from 2 to 14 days the mortality rate associated with mers co-v is over 30 3 mers co-v is a zoonotic virus wherein human beings may get infected due to direct or indirect contact with infected animals 4 camels have been identified as a carrier 5 it is believed that the mers-cov is transmitted to humans from camels through respiratory droplet saliva or consuming undercooked camel meat or milk using viral genome sequencing the zoonotic nature of the virus was confirmed 6 mers co-v rna was detected in nasal swab of infected camels and their antibodies were found in 70 of the positively tested camels 7 contact with infected people in healthcare facilities houses and communities have also contributed to the spread of the disease 8 9 10 11 healthcare facilities are the major source of nosocomial outbreak of the disease 12 studies conducted have reported that there is no pandemic risk associated with the disease acquired through contact with infected people 13 proper awareness of modes of transmission of the disease can help in preventing the spread of the infection several studies have been conducted to assess the knowledge of mers among various sections of the society 14 15 16 a recent study conducted throws light on the lack of knowledge of the general public regarding the probable epidemic nature of the disease 15 according to the information provided by the world health organization who about 27 countries have reported cases on mers co-v infection since 2012 nearly 80 of the cases have been reported from the middle eastern country kingdom of saudi arabia acute respiratory problem along with fever cough or shortness of breath are the most common symptoms of mers co-v infection apart from the aforementioned health problems many people infected with the virus suffered from diarrhoea nausea or vomiting in a small fraction of cases people with infection showed very mild or no symptoms the mortality rate is comparatively high in people suffering from comorbidities 17 people suffering from kidney problems cancer diabetics respiratory problems etc are more likely to be severely infected by the virus 12 rivers et al used poisson regression to identify the risk factors associated with death and severity of the disease they concluded that advancing age and pre-existing diseases were the main risk factors leading to death and severe infection 18 ahmed employed statistical methods to determine the predictors responsible for recovery from the disease after 3 and 30 days of onset of symptoms the study identified old age non-healthcare workers severe infection and hospital-acquired infection as the leading factors responsible for mortality 19 al-turaiki et al used predictive models such as nave bayes and j48 to analyse mers data pertaining to saudi arabia 20 the recovery model generated indicates that the healthcare workers are most likely to recover from the infection in the case of non-healthcare workers pre-existing diseases hamper the recovery the authors also generated a stability model from which it can be inferred that in the case of people with pre-existing diseases symptoms and age turned out to be the significant factors in determining the severity of viral infection abdullah et al used classification methods such as support vector machine random forest and nave bayes to detect mers co-v infection the authors observed that people above 50 years had more chances of infection compared to the rest 21 the studies on the trends associated with infectious diseases are broadly classified into computational mathematical and surveillance based methods 22 our paper aims at identifying the important factors which influence the recovery of mers co-v infected people in the kingdom of saudi arabia machine learning techniques and statistical analysis are employed for the purpose the data for analysis was taken from the control and command centre ministry of health website of the kingdom of saudi arabia mers co-v cases from january 2015 to april 2018 have been used in the study a total number of 983 mers cases were reported during this period although there has been a tremendous reduction in the number of new cases compared to the year 2014 until now the disease has not been brought under control the information gathered consisted of daily records based on new cases recovery cases and death cases the recovery and death cases were mapped with the new cases reported to gather more information regarding the patients infected with mers the unmatched patient records were eliminated and hence 836 patient records were used for analysis out of the 836 cases 52 patients were initially reported as dead hence those cases were also removed from the dataset and 784 cases were used in the study the description of the database used for research is shown in table 1
 the database analysed consists of 261 death cases support vector machine is also known as hyperplane classifier as it strives to find a hyperplane which is capable of dividing the different classes of data with a relatively large margin it has the capability to learn independent of the number of features of the dataset svm with a radial kernel is used to perform the experiments naives bayes is based on the assumption that the factors of the dataset considered are in no way related to one another it is based on bayes theorem which computes the conditional probability of the classification result based on independent factors 23 conditional probability is computed as shown in eq 11pcxpxcpcpxwhere c denotes the target variable and x is the predictor conditional inference tree is a widely used tree-based classification technique it differs from rpart in the strategy adopted to select variables while splitting the tree rpart selects variable by maximizing information criterion while conditional inference tree selects variables which are statistically significant j48 generates c45 trees which are either pruned or unpruned 24 the decision tree method c45 is an extension of iterative dichotomiser 3 id3 the nodes are split based on the difference in entropy c45 is capable of handling both continuous and discrete attributes logistic regression also known as logit regression is a classification method used to predict the value of a categorical variable it models the probability of the response belonging to a particular category logistic regression involves computing the log odds of an event which is considered equivalent to multiple linear regression function in this work binomial logistic regression was used because the outcome of the prediction belongs to any one of the two classes death or recovery the important predictors associated with mers recovery was obtained by computing the variable importance associated with different machine learning methods by considering the entire data as the train data the graphical representation of the variable importance of factors corresponding to various methods are shown in fig 1
 it is evident from various plots in fig 1 that the four most important factors associated with survival of mers co-v infected people are initial status of the disease istatus age pre-existing diseases predisease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not hcw statistical analysis such as univariate and multivariate logistic regression were also carried out to find the important factors associated with recovery from mers the estimate and p-values of the analysis are tabulated in table 2
 the presence of asterisk next to the p-value in table 2 indicates that the attribute is significant the p-values of significant variables are visually encoded the significance codes less than 0001 between 0001 and 001 between 001 and 005 and between 005 and 01 are represented using the symbol    and  dot respectively in the aforementioned table estimate refers to the log of odds a negative value of estimate indicates that the variable has a negative impact on recovery and vice versa it can be inferred from univariate and multivariate analysis that all variables except symptoms and animal exposure are significant in determining the recovery of a patient multivariate analysis was again done by taking the top four significant variables obtained from the multivariate analysis performed earlier and the results are shown in table 3
 it is evident from table 3 that all the four variables are highly significant with p-value less than 001 it can be inferred from table 3 that the most significant factor influencing recovery is the severity of the disease indicated by initial status the most important factors identified by the various machine learning methods are initial status healthcare worker or not age and pre-existing diseases the results of the important variables identified by machine learning models such as svm j48 naives bayes and ctree are consistent with the earlier studies 18 19 2025 the j48 decision tree developed by al-turaiki et al identified that pre-existing disease and whether the patient is a healthcare professional or not are the main factors influencing recovery 20 the study conducted based on mers infection in south korea identified age and comorbidities as vital factors in determining recovery 25 on analysis of the data it has been observed that there is only a slight difference between the death rate in patients exposed to camels and patients not exposed to camels hence the feature animal exposure turned out to be an insignificant attribute however it is to be specially noted that nearly 80 of the recovered patients who had exposure to camels were initially in a stable condition this may have contributed immensely to recovery thereby making camel exposure as an insignificant factor nearly 10 of the mers infected patients exhibited no symptoms and had recovered from the disease it has been observed from the data obtained that all the asymptomatic patients were less severely infected and a majority of them acquired infection from others the death rate among healthcare workers is negligible this is due to increased infection awareness early diagnosis and protective measures taken 26 the univariate analysis of survival yields the result that gender is a significant factor and male are more likely to die there is a considerable difference between the number of male and female infected patients furthermore the survival rate in women are more than men this may be due to the following reasonsinearly 33 of the infected women are healthcare personnel while it is only 8 in the case of meniithe social set up in the country makes men more prone to the disease than women 27iiicompared to women men are most likely to be in direct contact with camels as per the data analysed nearly 94 of the patients in contact with camels were men
 however it is evident from table 2 that on performing multivariate analysis gender feature turns out to be least significant 11 this is due to the fact that attributes such as age pre-existing diseases and critical initial status shield the gender attribute it is obvious that irrespective of gender the aforementioned characteristics adversely affect recovery univariate analysis shows that acquiring infection from others is a significant feature the death rate due to primary infection is nearly double that of infection acquired from others both univariate and multivariate analysis shows that age is a significant attribute in determining recovery and older people are more likely to die the mortality rate is around 50 in patients above 50 years of age this is attributed to the fact that they are most likely to suffer from other comorbidities 12 both univariate and multivariate analysis reflect that pre-existing diseases have a negative impact on recovery the above facts suggest that the elderly and people suffering from comorbidities demand special care in the treatment of mers 18 initial status is the most significant attribute as per the results of both univariate and multivariate analysis this result is consistent with the other machine learning model based methods used in the present work the results of which are depicted in fig 1 positive value for the estimate of initial status stable indicates that the recovery rate is high in patients with less severe disease in this paper the main factors influencing the recovery of mers patients in saudi arabia are identified based on cases reported by command and control centre of ministry of health ksa machine learning models and statistical analysis are used for this purpose the important factors identified include the patients age pre-existing diseases initial status severity of the infection and whether heshe is a healthcare worker or not though mers co-v is zoonotic in nature animal exposure is not a major factor leading to death this is evidently due to stable initial condition of majority of the patients exposed to camels the experiments conducted show that the severity of the disease is the most significant factor influencing recovery from the disease it is apparent that the mortality rate can be reduced considerably if the infected people seek medical attention at the earliest therefore widespread public awareness regarding the symptoms of mers will play a vital role in increasing the recovery rate since the infection also spreads due to person to person contact an effective monitoring system is highly essential to prevent the disease from spreading no funding sources none declared not required  recovery rate and factors associated with smell and taste disruption in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pablo parente-arias pilar barreira-fernandez ana quintana-sanjuas berta patio-castieira   at the end of 2019 some patients in wuhan china developed bilateral pneumonia that was subsequently determined to be caused by a novel coronavirus now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 the disease it causes has been named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and it has become a pandemic that has rapidly spread virtually worldwide the virus is transmitted via oronasal cavities 2 through aerosols and droplets from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients 34 the most common symptoms reported in china include fever coughing dyspnea sputum production myalgia arthralgia headache and diarrhea otolaryngologic symptoms were less prevalent in those studies but included sore throat 715 nasal discharge 5 nasal obstruction 5 and anosmia andor ageusia 5 5 smell and taste dysfunction have been reported by otolaryngologists in covid-19 patients sometimes as the sole symptoms present and this has led to issue specific recommendations in this regard some evidence has emerged implicating both olfactory and gustatory disruptions as indicative clinical symptoms in covid-19 patients outside china the aims of the current study were to investigate and characterize the occurrence duration and recovery of olfactory and gustatory disruptions in a geographically defined cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 and investigate the relationships between these disruptions and demographic and clinical features an observational cohort study involving consecutively diagnosed covid-19 patients between march the 3rd 2020 and march the 24th 2020 in the province of lugo spain was performed inclusion criteria were age  18 years and covid-19 confirmed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr the exclusion criteria were inability to speak on the telephone olfactory or gustatory dysfunction prior to the covid-19 epidemic and lack of informed consent insufficient cognitive skills to collaborate were also considered an exclusion criterion cognitive skills were assessed via interview subjectively assessed by the evaluator and from medical records initial telephone interviews were conducted between april the 1st 2020 and april the 10th 2020 by four researchers form april the 14th 2020 to june 25th 2020 researchers re-contacted patients who had reported persistence of symptoms during the first telephone interview to assess whether they had recovered or were experiencing ongoing persistence electronic charts were reviewed during telephone interviews and all relevant clinical data were confirmed by the patient the questionnaire included age sex date of clinical onset date of testing general clinical symptoms fever dry cough dyspnea diarrhea myalgia among others and their dates of onset presence of otolaryngologic symptoms rhinorrhea nasal obstruction sore throat otalgia facial pain and medical history specific otolaryngologic history comorbidities previous chronic treatment current treatment based on potentially relevant laboratory test results imaging and clinical data obtained from electronic records patients were classified in accordance with wang et al 6 and assigned to a mild group mild to moderate in wangs classification or to a severe group severe and critical in wangs classification questions pertaining to olfactory impairment were based on the self-reported mini olfactory questionnaire 7 but were adapted to be applied to isolated patients ability to smell sanitary alcohol bleach perfume and coffee were assessed based on patients answers they were assigned to a no symptoms group no change in their ability to recognize usual smells hyposmic group who experienced changes in their sensitivity but that they still had maintained perception of strong odors or anosmic group unable to perceive any smells taste impairment was measured by means of relevant questions featured in the united states national health and nutrition examination survey 8 based on the patients answers they were assigned to a no symptoms group no change in their ability to perceive taste a dysgeusia group alteration or distortion of their ability to taste or an ageusia group their ability to taste was reduced or abolished galicia ethics committee santiago de compostela spain approved the study protocol study code 2020-186 and informed consent was obtained from all patients statistical analyses were performed using version 352 of the r programming language r project for statistical computing r foundation relationships between variables were assessed via the chi-square test the kaplan-meier method was used to generate curves to estimate the timing of the emergence of symptoms and curves derived from patients with mild disease were compared with curves derived from patients with severe disease via the log-rank test lastly the comparative influences of different factors on diseases severity were investigated using logistic regression associated odd-ratios and 95 confidence intervals the first 184 patients who tested positive in the first 1007 pcr tests performed at lugo were considered for inclusion in the study but 33 were excluded based on the aforementioned criteria of these 33 patients 9 had been intubated in the intensive care unit during the study 7 were in the intensive care unit and their clinical circumstances rendered participation in the interview impossible 7 had died 4 were uncontactable 3 had dementia 2 were aged 18 years and 1 refused to participate a total of 151 patients completed the study 53 men and 98 women and their mean age was 552 years range 1888 years thirty-five patients were included in the severe group because they fulfilled the requirements at some point during the evolution of their disease condition patient characteristics and comorbidities are summarized in table 1
 and non-mutually exclusive general and otolaryngologic symptoms are presented in table 2
 of the 151 patients who completed the study 99 656 reported olfactory or gustatory symptoms of these 6799 677 reported loss of either smell or taste 899 81 reported just smell alterations and 2499 242 reported only taste alterations table 3
 olfactory dysfunction was reported by 75151 patients 497 including 49 325 who reported anosmia and 26 172 who reported hyposmia isolated anosmia neither general nor otolaryngological symptom unless anosmia was found in 2 patients 13 olfactory dysfunction was significantly associated age 632 of patients aged 60 years vs 312 aged 60 years p  0028 sex 591 in women vs 320 in men p  0003 and comorbidities 619 in patients with no comorbidities 394 with one p  0031 240 with two p  0049 but not with clinical severity 543 of mild to moderate patients vs 342 of severe patients p  03table 3 anosmia or hyposmia developed on the same day as the rest of the symptoms in 1975 patients 253 in the rest of the patients time from clinical onset to olfactory disruption varied from 1 day to 11 days mean 44  06 days the time to anosmia or hyposmia development was significantly shorter in mild to moderate patients than in severe patients p  005 fig 1
 although all patients reported improvement in 1175 147 patients the symptom remained at the final follow-up timepoint which constituted durations ranging from 91 to 108 days mean 1005  33 days in those in whom the symptom had resolved by the final follow-up timepoint it had lasted from 3 to 60 days mean 177  89 days 552 of them in the first 12 days fig 2
 gustatory dysfunction was reported by 91151 patients 603 including 59 391 who reported ageusia and 32 212 who reported dysgeusia the presence of ageusia or dysgeusia was only significantly associated with sex 683 in women vs 434 in men p  0028 the present study adds evidence to the knowledge base pertaining to alterations in smell and taste and covid 19 and to our knowledge its the first study to find association between these symptoms and age sex disease severity and comorbidities the rate of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction found was 656 497 olfactory and 603 gustatory showing a recovery rate of 853 after at least 91 days in the longest follow up reported the prevalence of such symptoms varies markedly between studies from 51 to 980 9 several factors are involved in this variation the most influential is the technique used to assess the presence of olfactory or gustatory disruption chart review studies were initially used by vaira et al 10 and mao et al 11 and reported prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction from 51 to 194 records-based investigations underestimate such symptoms because assessment was not included in previous clinical protocols self-reporting of symptoms via online questionnaires has been used by lechien et al 12 reporting 856 olfactory dysfunction and 880 gustatory dysfunction notably however self-reported olfactory acuity is reportedly inaccurate 13 some studies have assessed symptoms via oral interviews giacomelli et al 14 interviewed 59 hospitalized patients and 339 reported at least one taste or olfactory disorder and 186 reported both although they may both underestimate or overestimate olfactory acuity 15 to study the alteration of smell as a symptom of covid-19 it is crucial that the patient is aware of the disruption and can convey it during an anamnesis visual scales may yield more accurate measures of smell and taste than most other methods 16 yan et al 17 used an online visual scale to compare olfactory and gustatory functions in covid-19-positive and covid-19-negative patients and reported olfactory loss in 68 and gustatory loss in 71 of covid-19-positive patients and 16 and 17 in negative subjects validated quantitative olfactory testing is considered the most accurate method of assessment moein et al have used it to compare covid-19-positive patients with covid-19-negative and found that 98 of covid-19-positive patients had objective olfactory disruption although only 35 of the patients reported smell and or taste disruption previously 18 different recruitment tools may yield different study results recruiting a sample that includes all infected patients from asymptomatic to critical is very difficult some studies are very weak in this respect because participants have been recruited via the internet leaflets andor word-of-mouth strategies whereby the patient can become aware of the aims of the study 12 other studies have tried to overcome these limitations through different strategies pertaining to demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample 1217 and comparisons with other clinical studies 18 in the present study there were associations between these disruptions and age sex and disease severity age is known to be associated with olfactory loss 15 all patients in the present study reported normal olfactory and gustatory function before covid-19 onset and disruption was based on differential acuity thereafter only one previous study has shown this 14 some evidence suggests that olfactory capacity is worse in men than in women at all ages 15 in the covid-19 patients in the current study olfactory and gustatory disruptions were more common in women than in men as it has been reported in other studies 1214 but this was not found in objective testing studies 18 it could mean that women can be aware of smell and taste alteration better than men in our study we found an association between presence of comorbidities and clinical severity and smell disruptions patients with one or more comorbidities reported less smell and taste disruptions and the timing of presentation differed between severe and non-severe patients mild and moderate patients reported an earlier onset of olfactory dysfunction this has not been reported in previous studies even if yan et al 19 reported that anosmia was strongly and independently associated with outpatient care the meaning of the observation is not clear one proposed pathophysiological mechanism of anosmia involves a bigger local inflammatory response the first days of the infection mediated by upregulated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which increases the risk of coronavirus infection resulting in greater olfactory dysfunction but protecting against lung injury as it was proposed in smokers 20 in the present study smell and taste disruptions occurred at various points during disease progression the existence of a common syndrome associated with covid-19 infection termed isolated sudden onset anosmia has been proposed in some studies 21 notably only 2 patients in the present study reported other non-olfactory and non-gustatory symptoms probably exhaustive interview with simultaneous access to clinical electronic data and close follow up allowed to identify other symptoms associated there is a lack of evidence about long term prognosis of olfactive disruption in covid-19 hopkins et al 22 stated that 801 of patients reported improvement in one week and chary et al 23 found that 64 of patients referred complete recovery after 15 days in the present study 853 patients experienced a total recovery of the smell in the first two months smell disruption improved in the remaining patents although continue after three months suggesting that recovery will be more difficult the longer the symptom lasts the pathophysiology of olfactory and gustatory disruption in covid-19 patients remains unclear in the olfactory system sustentacular cells stem cells and perivascular cells but not in olfactory sensory neurons or olfactory bulb neurons constitute a prime candidate for sars-cov-2 infection via the nose and possibly for sars-cov-2-induced anosmia because like respiratory ciliated cells they both have ace2 receptors and membrane-anchored serine protease 2 which are uncommon characteristics in other human tissues via these components nerve dysfunction may be mediated by damage to support cells and ensuing inflammation without neuronal infection or altering neurotransmission in the absence of neurosensory cell death 24 enabling regeneration fluctuation and spontaneous improvement taste sensory receptors may be affected in a similar way because ace2 receptors are expressed in the oral mucosa 2526 the main aim of the present study was to investigate a representative sample of patients that was minimally affected by the usual sources of recruitment bias thus it included all patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the first test performed during a short period in a specific geographical area and resulted in a representative sample with regard to age sociocultural background and disease severity we consider telephone interviews based on a validated questionnaire the most reliable way to assess the presence of smell and taste alteration not acuity both in home-isolated patients and in hospitalized patients and allow a close follow up of the patients that adds information about duration and recovery nevertheless the sample was relatively small and geographically limited the method used to assess olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is not the most accurate ideally an electrophysiological method or sniffing test that can quantify smell and taste acuity and accurately distinguish between olfactory and gustatory symptoms would be used nevertheless such methods require direct interaction between patients and researchers and are thus impractical in patients who are isolated at home or in hospital and may be unnecessary if dysfunction can be reliably established via other patient-based methods irrespective of significance or effects on prognosis although it is the longest follow-up period published whether the persistent olfactory or gustatory disruption reported by some patients at the last interview will be permanent remains to be determined these results suggest that during the current pandemic it may be beneficial to investigate the presence and time of appearance of smell disruptions in individual patients with respect to initial diagnosis preventive isolation and clinical prognosis smell disruption has showed less value for patients these disruptions have good prognosis as they improved in all patients with a complete recovery in 853 in the first two months olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in covid-19 patients has an high prevalence and smell disruption is associated with and age sex comorbidities and time to appearance is associated with clinical severity although all patients improved some of them reports alteration after two months follow-up so further research is needed all authors contributed equally this research

disease caused by corona virus and can lead to severe respiratory diseases in humans with the outbreak of novel corona virus who on 30 th january 2020 declared it a public health emergency and further on 11 th march 2020 covid-19 disease was declared a pandemic india in the initial stages of the pandemic dealt with it in a very effective manner with timely implementation of lockdown india was able to contain the spread of covid-19 to some extent however with the recently announced unlock 10 the sars cov-2 is expected to spread this study aims to track and analyze the covid-19 situation in major states that constitute of 70 percent of the total cases thus the states selected for the study are maharashtra delhi tamil nadu gujarat uttar pradesh and rajasthan these are the states which had more than ten thousand covid-19 patients ason june 10 th 2020 the analysis period is from march 25 th to june 10 th and the data source is indias covid-19 tracker to assess the previous and current covid-19 situations in these states indicators such as active rates recovery rate case fatality rate test positivity rate tests per million cases per million test per confirmed case has been used the study finds that although the absolute number of active cases may be rising however it is showing a decreasing trend with an increase in recovery rates with increasing number of covid-19 cases testing also has increased however not in the similar proportion and thus by developed nation standard we are lagging with increasing tpr and cases per million delhi is well on its way to surpass even mumbai which till now has proven to be worst hit in this pandemic an interesting finding is that of test per confirmed case which shows that every 6 th person in maharashtra and every 8 th in delhi is showing positive result of covid-19 test given such an increase and unlocked india delhi might soon enter into the third stage of community transmission where source of 50 percent or more cases would be unknown there has  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review  been an increase in the covid-19 related health infrastructure with the public-private partnership which involved both private hospitals and lab joining hands to battle covid-19 however affordability still remains an issue if experts are to be believed pandemic isnt over because we ve unlocked the worst is yet to come as covid-19 is predicted to peak in mid-july to august in india thus itd be advisable to not venture out unnecessarily just because restrictions have been lifted also following the guidelines-hand-washing avoiding public gathering social distancing and covering nose and mouth has now become imperative covid-19 like its ancestors sars and mers is caused by a zoonotic pathogen by the name corona virus and can cause severe respiratory diseases in humans 1 2  world health organization on january 30 th 2020 declared novel coronavirus as public health emergency of international concern and on march 11 th 2020 covid-19 disease was stated as pandemic based on its spreads severity 3  a peculiar aspect of covid-19 disease is that its transmission can be symptomatic mild symptomatic or even asymptomatic a study conducted by indian council of medical research said that out of total active cases till april 30 th  28 percent were asymptomatic and it was also observed that such patients were younger and without comorbidities 4  the said study also evaluated covid-19 patients by age and stated that the attack rate per million was highest among 50-69 years old and lowest among children below 10 years old gender wise attack rate was higher among men compared to women 5  india has 287157 confirmed covid-19 cases out of which 48 percent patients constitute the active cases and 49 percent patients have recovered as on june 10 th 2020 6  in order to check the spread of cov-2 at an early stage a nationwide lockdown was implemented in four phases from march 25 th to may 31 st 2020 many studies asserted that without lockdown cases would have tripled or quadrupled in comparison to todays figure 7  on april 11 th the joint secretary of health ministry lav agarwal presented a graph which projected covid cases had lockdown not been implemented and stated the scenario would have been grave as the statistic of confirmed cases and doubling rate would have sky rocketed 8  also the world health organization emergencies programme executive director michael ryan on june 5 th said that due to lockdown in india the doubling time for covid-19 spread is about three weeks at present 9  on 1 st june 2020 around 9 weeks after the first phase of lockdown india announced unlock 10 but the question remains whether lifting the lockdown is a good idea in accordance to the world health organization recommendations a nation could unlock only if and when daily positivity rates fall below 5 percent and remain so for a period of 14 days however indias daily positivity rates was nowhere near 5 percent and stood at 77 percent on june 1st 10  with the increasing spread of corona virus infections it becomes imperative for the testing to increase in the same or at least similar proportion testing per million population serves as an important indicator to compare nations in regard to handling covid-19 disease enough testing ensures and gives the actual figures of covid-19 patients india although has conducted more than 5 million tests yet it is not adequate given indias population the figure for its testing per million population remain less than many other covid-19 affected countries 11  a study while analysing the burden of pandemic in india found that maharashtra having highest number of covid-19 positive cases is solely responsible for more than one third of cases as on may 17 th 2020 followed by gujarat and tamil nadu also higher test positivity rate is another issue in these states along with this the study also forecasted that covid-19 designated hospitals are less in number and that soon all the ventilators will be occupied due to increasing number of patients along with other patients suffering from communicable and non-communicable disease amidst this pandemic 12  this can turn out to be true in forthcoming days as peak of covid-19 cases is expected in mid-july therefore this study aims to track and analyze the covid-19 situations of the major states which share almost 70 burden of the total cases thus the states taken into consideration for the study are the states which had more than 10000 confirmed covid-19 patients ason june 10 th  the six major states so included are

march 25 th 2020 measures like social distancing covering face and nose maintaining hygiene and avoiding public gathering were made compulsory the measures were to ensure the break of human chain for transmission and thus ultimately tackle the sars cov-2 spread the government has been trying to beat covid-19 at two fronts one flatten the curve of coronavirus positive cases and second to restrict the exponential growth in the number of positive cases 14  however with the announcement of first unlock on june 1 st 2020 the statistics are bound to change this study has thus tried to show how indias numbers have behaved since lockdown to till june 10 th ie 10 days into the unlocked india and the strategies used by government of india to counter covid-19 the ministry of health and family welfare stated on june 12 th that indias doubling rate of covid-19 cases has increased from 34 days when lockdown began march 25 th  to 174 days currently 15  along with it indias active cases rate and case fatality rate are decreasing whereas recovery rate is showing an upward trend since the outbreak at present recovery rate is higher than active cases rate however this is not the point to let our guards down as the peak is yet to reach of the pandemic also recovery rates talks about cumulativeaccumulated numbers whereas active rate give the current situation thus making them non-comparable 16  simultaneously an analysis of the current situation in terms of new active cases and new recovered cases in the duration of 10 days from unlock 10 the situation is opposite the active cases are more than recovered cases 17   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 20 2020  this study highlighted the performance of six states but the states that stood out were maharashtra tamil nadu and most importantly delhi which were well below assuring level as there active cases are not only fluctuating but also increasing as indias move to unlock 10 number of new cases coming on a daily basis are alarming in these major states making them a contributor to more than 70 percent covid-19 test positivity rate clearly show how the cases are accelerating with maharashtra and delhi as the top contributors however test per million population of india and in the selected states are increasing an increase in number of testing can trace an infected person at an earlier stage and thus inhibit its transmission at the same time since its source would be recognizable itll save the states from reaching stage three of cov-2 transmission indian council of medical research has granted private laboratories the access to conduct testing for covid-19 and hence this has led to a better and increased capacity and efficiency of testing with the increase in testing the cases per million population has increased and this comes out as a pressing matter of concern for india the study has highlighted the situation of delhi and maharashtra that have become major hotspots as test per positive cases in maharashtra is 6 percent and in delhi it is 8 percent which means in maharashtra out of every 6 person tested one is coming as coronavirus positive and in delhi out of every 8 persons tested one is coming positive this graph is going down steadily for all the selected states and for india as whole meaning that the spread is once again gaining pace as the daily cases are increasing the government has also realized the need of more hospitals in india therefore the number of covid-19 designated hospitals have been increased by 22 percent ie from 2719 covid-19 health centers on may 7 th to 3319 covid-19 health centers on june 5 th 18  with the inclusion of private labs and increasing number of health centers government is trying to counter the covid-19 crisis with increased testing and accessibility of hospitals for infected patients but even after this we are grappling to match pace with the increasing covid-19 cases especially in delhi and maharashtra the number of active and newly infected cases are showing a tremendous increase in these 2 states india has spent only 128 percent of gdp on its health infrastructure which is quite less when compared to other developed nation where pandemic is at peak as per global health experts prediction india lags in health infrastructure and capability to deal with this pandemic 19  though india has performed well in wake of the sars cov pandemic it can be credited to timely  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

transmission yet it struggled to flatten the curve of infected patients however lockdown has delayed the peak of coronavirus in indian subcontinent giving it time to strengthen its health infrastructure and thus be better equipped to fight the upcoming challenge government of india is trying to tackle the pandemic with joining hands and involving both public as well as private laboratories and hospitals to share the burden however to ensure the affordability along with accessibility government needs to have an upper ceiling of the charges that people would have to pay in order to get treated thus it can be said that india fared well at the beginning with timely lockdown and series of quick actions but this was at cost of economy with new regime of unlock 10 india is reluctant to ignore economy anymore and thus indias initial success of containing the spread of cov-2 seems to be faltering india is trying to counter the pandemic with public-private partnership as well as an increase in efficiency and accessibility of testing and health care facility but the affordability still remains an aspect that can be worked upon where on one hand india is grappling to take control of the situation with increase in daily positivity rates and tests per positive cases on the other hand if experts are to be believed we are yet to see the worst of it in around mid-july to august when cov-2 would reach its actual peak hence it goes without saying that it isnt the end of pandemic and even though lockdown has been lifted itd be advisable to not venture out unnecessarily and maintain social distancing avoiding public places and covering mouth and nose along with the recommended hygiene practices  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

in india kuldeep singh aryan agarwal  the present study examines the impact of weather indicators on the covid-19 outbreak in the majorly affected states of india in this study we hypothesize that the weather indicators could significantly influence the impact of the corona virus the kendall and spearman rank correlation tests were chosen to conduct the statistical analysis in this regard we compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts recovered case counts deceased cases average temperature maximum relative humidity maximum wind speed for six most affected states of india during the period of march 25 2020 to april 24 2020 we investigated that the average humidity and average temperature seven days ago play a significant role in the recovery of coronavirus cases the rise in average temperature will improve the recovery rate in the days to come the cities with very high humidity levels or dry weather conditions have high probabilities of recovery from covid-19 the findings of this research will help the policymakers to identify risky geographic areas and enforce timely preventive measures  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an infectious disease which initially detected in wuhan china has now spread all over the world and if not well dealt it could even lead to the worldwide economic crisis this virus exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility that is the reason it has spread all across the world in a very short span of time the world health organization who reported 2626321 covid-19 confirmed cases and 181938 deaths worldwide until april 24 2020 1  the deadly virus has affected more than 210 countries had been affected where united states us alone contributed approximately onefourth of the total cases other major countries having a significant impact are spain italy iran france germany uk turkey china and many more the situation in india has started worsening day by day the first covid-19 case in india was reported on january 30 2020 and as on april 24 2020 india has 23077 covid-19 confirmed cases including 718 deaths 1  as per who india has not entered into the state of the community transmission still it has clusters of cases india had enforced nationwide lockdown from march 25 2020 to april 14 2020 and further extended it till may 3 2020 the lockdown might have lowered the transmission rate of the covid-19 pandemic figure 1 shows the overall picture of confirmed cases of covid-19 across the states of india many geographical social political and environmental factors might influence the impact of this deadly

average temperature same day has shown some associations with confirmed and recovered cases as posited by 16  these outcomes might be due to a certain profile of the temperature in these states 17 also reported similar findings that warm weather would play an important role in suppressing the virus in this study it has been analyzed that the states having different humidity profiles exhibit different recovery response from covid-19 the results show that average relative humidity 7 days ago has a conclusive association with recovered cases in all the states the two states tamilnadu and maharashtra where the average relative humidity is in range  65-85  are positively correlated with recovered cases which implies that recovery chances are higher in the humid environment however the other states where humidity levels are comparatively low and range approximately between 20 to 60 has a negative correlation between relative humidity 7 days ago with the recovered cases it can be concluded that the cities with very high humidity levels or very low humidity levels have high probabilities of recovery from covid-19 by and large the maximum relative humidity on the same day doesnt exhibit a significant association with the covid-19 cases in the duration of this study which contradicts the study in iran 12  in the time interval of this study we observed that the wind speed does

patients   f contributions y l  y n  w  background coronavirus disease 2019 has become a public health emergency the widely used reverse transcription pcr rt-pcr method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment methods a total of 323 samples from 76 covid-19 confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital pcr ddpcr and rt-pcr based two target genes orf1ab and n nasal swabs throat swabs sputum blood and urine were collected clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging in 95 samples tested positive by both methods the cycle threshold ct of rt-pcr was highly correlated with the copy numbed of ddpcr orf1ab gene r 2  083 n gene r 2  087 4 4161 negative and 41 4167 single-gene positive samples tested by rt-pcr were positive according to ddpcr with viral load ranging from 111 to 1232 copiestest then the viral load of respiratory samples was compared and the average viral load in sputum 17429  6920 copiestest was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs 2552  1965 copiestest p  0001 and nasal swabs 651  501 copiestest p  0001 furthermore the viral load in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage 46800  17272 vs 1252  1027 p  0001 analyzed by sputum samples conclusions quantitative monitoring of viral load in lower respiratory tract samples helps to evaluate disease progression especially in cases of low viral load  a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has been identified as the pathogen of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1  the outbreak of covid-19 has spread around the world and become a public health emergency of international concern 2 3 4 5  there have been more than 80000 infections and 2858 deaths reported as of february 28 2020 since the first case was identified in december 2019 6 7  at present viral nucleic acid detection by reverse transcription pcr rt-pcr is regarded as the gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of covid-19 8 9  however the sensitivity and reliability of rt-pcr was questioned due to the presence of negative results in some patients who were highly suspected of having the disease based on clinical presentation and exposure history as well as positive results in some confirmed cases after recovery 10 11  in addition the rt-pcr method has limitations on viral load analysis for evaluating disease progression and prognosis and unable to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral drugs several studies have shown that droplet digital pcr ddpcr has the advantages of absolute quantification and is more sensitive for virus detection than rt-pcr 12 13  in this study we compared rt-pcr and ddpcr for covid-19 diagnosis and explored the changes in viral load in different tissue samples and during disease progression with sars-cov-2infected patients from february 5 to february 19 2020 400 samples from 127 patients were tested simultaneously by rt-pcr and ddpcr in beijing ditan hospital capital medical university as shown in figure 1  the enrolled 127 subjects included 54 confirmed cases 39 suspected cases and 34 patients who were screened due to fever or respiratory symptoms but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for suspected cases which were as follows a patient with one exposure history and two clinical conditions a fever andor respiratory symptoms b imaging features of viral pneumonia c normal or low white blood cell count and reduced lymphocyte in the earlier period of onset or no clear exposure history but meet three clinical conditions 9  the diagnostic criteria was that a suspected case with positive rt-pcr assay or viral gene sequencing that was highly homologous with sars-cov-2 9  among the suspected cases 17 were found not to be covid-19 and 22 became confirmed cases with sars-cov-2 tested positive in respiratory tract samples as a result 76 final confirmed patients were included in the present study the clinical data of the 76 confirmed patients were collected including sex age symptoms and signs other chronic diseases laboratory examination imaging data and clinical typing information the clinical stages were divided into early progressive recovery phase and clinical cure the first three stages were determined according to chest computed tomography ct in the early phase the typical ct manifestations were multifocal bilateral or isolated round ground-glass opacity with or without patchy consolidations prominent peripherally subpleural distribution and mainly in posterior part or lower lobe in the progressive phase the number range and density of the lesions increased significantly and the distribution moved from peripheral to central in the recovery phase the lesions gradually 6 absorbed leaving a few cord like high-density shades 14  clinical cure was considered to be the recovery of temperature for more than 3 days the obvious improvement of respiratory symptoms the absorption of pulmonary imaging lesions and two consecutive negative rt-pcr results of respiratory samples at least one day apart 9  those with normal chest imaging were defined as uncertain stage nasal swabs throat swabs sputum blood and urine samples were collected viral rna  categorical variables were expressed as number  and continuous variables were described as mean  sem comparisons between two groups were made using the mann-whitney u test the correlation between the ct values of rt-pcr and viral load determined by ddpcr was analyzed with the spearman correlation test a p value less than 005 twosided was considered statistically significant the above-mentioned analyses were performed using either prism 70 graphpad la jolla ca usa or spss 190 college station tx usa software the 34 screened cases and 17 of the suspected cases were excluded from further analysis as the 77 samples from them were tested negative by both methods the 76 covid-19 confirmed cases were included in the final analysis the characteristics of confirmed participants are shown in table 1  the median age was 40 years iqr 32-63 range 6 months to 92 years and the proportion of men was 50 the most prevalent signs and symptoms at admission were fever 882 and cough 697 two patients had no symptoms or sign furthermore 776 of patients were the mild type while 224 were the severe type in terms of clinical stage 49 patients were in the recovery phase which accounted for the largest proportion 645 followed by the progressive phase 105 early phase 92 and clinical cure phase 66 seven patients were of uncertain stage because their chest imaging was normal the average days from symptom onset to the early progressive and recovery phases were 4 range 2-6 12 range 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  and 20 range 10-33 days after disease onset respectively the results showed that both rt-pcr and ddpcr were accurate and reliable in highviral-load samples and negative samples but ddpcr was better at detecting samples with low viral load according to the results of ddpcr 164 955 nasal swabs 373 50134 throat swabs and 664 77116 sputum samples were positive no positive results were found in blood or urine  table 2  the positive rate of sputum samples was significantly higher than that of throat swabs and nasal swabs then we further compared viral load among the three respiratory samples  figure 3a  the average viral load in sputum 17429  6920 copiestest was significantly higher than in throat swabs 2552  1965 copiestest p  0001 and nasal swabs 651  501 copiestest p  0001 the above results showed that sputum samples may better reflect the level of virus replication in vivo therefore we further analyzed the dynamic changes in viral load in the disease stages with 116 sputum samples from 44 confirmed patients the results showed that the viral load in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage 46800  17272 vs 1252  1027 p  0001 owing to the limit samples 6 patients were dynamically observed two patients in the progressive stage patient a patient b were each observed 3 times and the viral load increased over time  figure 3c  2 patients in the recovery stage patient c patient d were each observed 4 times and the viral load decreased over time  figure 3d  in addition the other two patients patient e patient f were continuously observed from february 11 to 19 for 6 times and 7 times respectively  figure 3e  patient e had 4 times of single-gene positive in rt-pcr patient f had 5 times and ddpcr showed viral load fluctuations at below 150 copiestest to determine the viral load levels of sars-cov-2 in different tissue samples the dynamic changes during disease progression and performance of ddpcr relative to rt-pcr in detecting the virus a total of 323 samples from 76 confirmed patients were analyzed we found that rt-pcr and ddpcr gave consistent results for high-viral-load samples however ddpcr was better in detecting low-viral-load samples the viral load of different tissues revealed that sputum samples contained more virus than throat and nasal swabs the quantitative results of sputum samples showed that the viral load increased first and then decreased during the disease course of covid-19 the results of rt-pcr and ddpcr were consistent in the 95 positive samples and the ct value of rt-pcr was highly correlated with the copy number value of ddpcr however when ct values were between 34 and 38 the viral load of samples with the same ct value was significantly different indicating that the ct value of rt-pcr may not sensitively reflect the level of viral load when the viral load is low this result is consistent with previous reports 15 16  in 67 single-gene-positive samples and 4 rt-pcr negative samples ddpcr gave positive results with low viral load suggesting that rt-pcr was unstable in the detection of low-vial-load samples previous study showed that sars-cov-2 existed in both the upper and lower respiratory tract 17  we analyzed the viral load of samples from different tissues with ddpcr and found that the positive rate and viral load of sputum were higher than those of throat swabs and nasal swabs these results demonstrated that although sars-cov-2 can colonize the upper respiratory tract lower respiratory tract samples could better reflect the viral replication level in infected patients in addition lower respiratory tract samples may also be more suitable than throat and nasal swabs for the etiological diagnosis of covid-19 which may increase the low detection rate among positive patients furthermore the dynamic changes in the viral load during the course of covid-19 were analyzed using the sputum samples consistent with recently reported studies 18 19  we found that the viral load increased in the early and progressive stages and decreased in the recovery stage in patient e and patient f who entered the recovery stage as determined by chest ct the viral load was found to fluctuate at a low level for more than 9 days before turning negative suggesting that some patients may have a long asymptomatic virus-carrying state before clinical cure some patients who had at least twice negative nucleic acid tests and reached the discharge standard were found to be positive again during reexamination there may be intermittent virus expulsion leading to nucleic acid results positive again in patients 11 recovered from covid-19 20  as time goes on a large number of patients will enter the recovery stage and face discharge and the monitoring of low viral load will be more frequent multiple tests of lower respiratory tract samples and by different methods maybe help to improve the sensitivity and assess whether discharge criteria are met according to the changes in viral load and chest ct in the course of covid-19 highlevel replication of the virus may indicate the progress of the disease effective antiviral therapy can shorten the course of disease and reduce the severity 21  however there is no effective antiviral therapy for covid-19 and it is extremely urgent to develop drugs in the future ddpcr may play an important role in evaluating the efficacy of antiviral drugs by dynamically detecting viral load this study has several limitations first although the result showed that the viral load in the samples of lower respiratory tract was high the sputum throat swabs and nasal swabs of the subjects were not matched during comparison matched analysis will be performed in another prospective cohort study of our team second due to the limited sample size we did not analyze the relationship between the viral load and the severity of covid-19 at different stages and further research is needed rt-pcr is sensitive and reliable but ddpcr performed better in detecting low-viralload samples sputum is a better indicator of viral replication in the body than throat and nasal swabs and the viral load of sputum samples tends to increase and then decrease during the course of the disease   solvable delay model for epidemic spreading the case of covid-19 in italy luca dellaposanna  we present a simple but realistic model for describing the diffusion of an infectious disease on a population of individuals the dynamics is governed by a single functional delay differential equation which in the case of a large population can be solved exactly even in the presence of a time-dependent infection rate this delay model has a higher degree of accuracy than the so-called sir model commonly used in epidemiology which instead is formulated in terms of a set of three ordinary differential equations we apply our model to describe the outbreak of the new virus covid-19 in italy taking into account the containment measures implemented by the government in order to mitigate the spreading of the virus and the social costs for the population  in a very few months a viral infection called covid-19 coronavirus disease 19 originated in china breaking through the borders of all the countries rapidly spread all over the globalized world italy is one of the hardest hit countries suffering from the very dramatic consequences of this disease the outbreak of the virus the new coronavirus which caused the infection seems out of our control in the absence of a therapy and a vaccine social distancing measures and a strict lockdown appear to be the most effective means to contain the growth of the infection we should remind that there are places in the world where often infectious diseases also those already defeated in the so-called more developed countries can still cause very severe consequences among the local populations even if we cannot answer the question why a virus starts spreading and which is its origin we can still wonder how it diffuses the aim of this work is therefore to provide a simple handy model for epidemic spreading which could depend only on the couple of parameters which generally characterize an infectious disease the infection rate and the infectiousness or recovery time both these quantities can be taken from the experience therefore we do not need further parameters to fit the data which could cause artificial predictions we will show that the model we are presenting have the same or even higher predictive power than that of one of the most widely used technique in epidemiology the sir model 1 2 3  this latter model requires the presence of a fictitious recovery rate related to the number of recovered persons without considering that the new cases of recovery and fatality come from infected cases occurring a period of time earlier the model we are proposing instead is based on the fact that the closed cases come from the infected ones after an average delay recovery time therefore contrary to the sir model formulated in terms of a set of three ordinary differential equations it is described by just a single equation a functional retarded differential equation bringing predictions more under control in this work we derive the exact analytical solution of this model in the limit of large population number also in the presence of a time-dependent infection rate which is the case when containment measures are implemented in order to reduce the spreading of the infection moreover the definition of the so-called basic reproduction number r 0 a parameter determining whether a infectious disease can spread or not comes out naturally in our delay model we finally apply this technique to give a quantitative description of the diffusion of covid-19 in italy showing the current scenario based on the actual situation and what would have happened without the containment measures generally it is quite difficult to give a reliable forecast on the fate of the epidemic spreading because it heavily depends on individual and social behaviors on the effectiveness of the containment measures already implemented or that will be taken by the government and on the future political decisions at the time being even if the situation in italy is improving it seems that more efforts are needed in order to change course and rapidly stop the spreading of the disease further measures might be useful like for instance i running more diagnostic tests at least on all the doctors and medical workers who are in contact with many patients ii improving the food distribution to avoid the crowding in the food shops and to ensure subsistence goods also to those who need iii providing medical devices like surgical masks to all the population as last remark we remind that the outbreak of covid-19 has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization many countries are already heavily overwhelmed by this infection and by the risk for the public health therefore in a networked world we all have to behave and operate with an improved spirit of cooperation the bitter lesson imparted by this tough situation is that we cannot save ourselves alone let us first consider the case in which a population of individuals subjected to an infection is not too large or the infection is such that the recovery time for an infected person is sufficiently long in this conditions one can expect that the epidemic diffusion is governed by the logistic equation equivalent to the so-called si model whose solution is simply given by where 1 is that it does not contain the mechanism of reduction of the spreading and the desired end of an epidemic disease we have therefore to take into account the number of closed cases persons who recovered or died which do not contribute to the infection anymore the model we are going to consider includes therefore the total number of infected f t and the total number of recovered and deceased persons rt so that eq 2 becomes in principle also rt can follow another dynamical equation however generally there is an average time of recovering t so that the total number of cases at some time t becomes closed cases at later time t  t namely this seems to be the case also for the new coronavirus spreading by looking at some reported data for covid-19 in italy shown in fig 1 see also ref 4  eq 4 allows us to write eq 3 in terms of only the function f t notice that as we will discuss later eq 3 can be derived also from the sir model if we consider the case where the population p is very large as long as f t p we can neglect the logistic term 1  f t p 1 so to have where  is the heaviside theta function eq 5 is a functional retarded differential equation writing the time t as t  n t  t  where n  t t is the integer part of tt the solution of eq 5 is given by where the functions a fulfill the following iterative equation with a 0 t  0 for any t  t and a 0 t  1 so that for  1 we recover a 1 t  e rt  the full exact solution is therefore obtained by solving a cascade of n local integrals the proof of eqs 6 and 7 is given in appendix a at time t  n t from eq 7 performing the chain of integrals and putting the results in eq 6 we get the following exact result for instance for n  1 and n  2 namely up to twice the infectiousness period the total number of cases is simply surprisingly we find that eq 8 depends only on r t which is called basic reproduction number r 0 see below it is easy to check from eq 8 that while for large r 0  rt f nt is dominated by an exponential behavior for r 0  1 f nt becomes linear in n from eq 6 and eq 7 we can notice that the function f t depends on its past therefore it seems governed by a non-makovian dynamics once we have the total number of infections f t we can also calculate the number of persons who are still infected at a given time t which is defined by in our model  so that eq 5 in terms of this quantity is simply df t dt  r it before to proceed a comment on the comparison with another model is in order the so-called sir model is one of the most used techniques for describing the spreading in time of an infection disease according to this model the population is divided into three parts represented by the number of susceptible st infected it and recovered rt individuals which vary over time see appendix b this model is almost equivalent to our simpler model eq 3-4 however a criticism which can be raised against the sir model is related to the fact that being formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations the model requires the presence of an effective recovery and fatality rate which might not correspond to the actual rate since the new cases of recovery and fatality come from infected cases occurring a few days earlier for that reason instead of writing the problem in terms of ordinary differential equations one has to do it in terms of functional differential equations let us consider eq 5 for t  t in the following form where we introduce and naturally identify r 0 as the so-called basic reproduction number which is a widely used parameter for predicting whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or turns off and represents the average number of cases originated by a single infectious case during the infectiousness period eq 11 implies that the first derivative of f t is equal to its increment in a time interval t divided by t namely increases more than linearly while for r  t 1 r 0  1 f t goes slower than linearly if we let r vary in time when r  t 1 r 0  1 the function f t has an inflection point where it changes from being concave to convex or vice versa making a comparison with the sir model where r 0  r one can identify  the fictitious recovery rate see appendix b with the inverse of the recovery time   1t let us now consider the possibility of having a time-dependent infection rate rt in the dynamical equation for the total number of infected persons also in this more general case the exact solution valid for any profile of rt can be written in the same form of eq 6 namely where now the functions a are given by for instance  this general result implies that if we knew the time dependence of the infection rate or if we could tailor its evolution by for instance containment measures we can know the exact analytical expression of f t the total number of infected persons as a function of time as long as f t is much smaller than p let us consider the delay model in its general form eqs 3- 4 where the infection rate r varies in time as the effect of some containment measures taken in order to reduce the impact of an infection on the population as an example let us suppose that rt is modified by social distancing measures lockdown and the shutdown of many work activities as in it is happening in italy and in many other countries to mitigate and reduce the spreading of the new coronavirus covid-19 after two main decrees imposed by the italian prime minister ordering the lockdown of the whole national territory taken on march 11-th lockdown and shutdown of many stores and march 22-th 2020 shutdown of many factories and strengthening of social distancing measures after some other measures taken right before for local regions eg the decree of march 8-th for the lockdown of lombardy and other areas as a result we can imagine that rt decreases smoothly after those dates taking into account the adaptation time for the individuals to the new social behaviors and the period needed to complete the last activities before the blockade of the factories let us suppose therefore that rt can change in time according to a smooth step function as in eq 17 where t 1 and t 2 are the times where the steps are located  1 and  2 make the function to be smooth r 1 is the initial observed infection rate which causes the starting exponential growth of the epidemic disease r 2 the intermediate rate which fits with the data supposed to be reached after the first decree of lockdown and r 3 the supposed asymptotic infection rate after the second decree of lockdown fixing the average of recovery and fatality time t the basic reproduction number is also a function of time according to r 0  rtt with a profile shown in fig 2  solving eq 16 or analogously using the recursive relation in eq 15 with the time-dependent rate rt given by eq 17  fixed by the parameters producing the profile depicted in fig 2  we obtain the solution f t which slowly goes to saturation over time in perfect agreement with the data for the total number of confirmed infected cases as shown by fig 3  where the blue line is the expected curve while the red points are the official data the dotted gray lines in fig 3 represent f t if the containment measures had not been taken as one can see from figs 2-3 only when r 0 becomes smaller than 1 the curve flattens allowing for a stop of the epidemic spreading avoiding that a large part of the population gets infected for r 0 1 f t would increase linearly and it would become almost constant meaning that the number of new infections would be equal to the number of closed cases a reliable forecast has to take into account the fact that the official data of infectious cases are made by counting mostly the symptomatic cases probably discarding other infectious cases which could transfer the virus even without or with mild symptoms moreover the data of both the total number of infected persons and that of the recovered ones could be affected by the procedure the realization times and the number of the diagnostic tests however since our model relies on the infectiousness time it does not need a fitting of the data for recovered persons which may be affected by systematic errors this uncertainty on the data for closed cases would compromise the result for the sir model on the contrary our theoretical prediction based on the delay model agrees fairly well with the data-set for total infected cases as shown in fig 3  as a final remark we remind that most of the confirmed infected cases in italy are counted after the appearance of the symptoms and the persons who exhibit severe ones are mostly hospitalized and afterwards counted as infected persons some of them unfortunately die approximately 4 days after therefore after approximately 9 days from the onset of the first symptoms as reported by the istituto superiore di sanit wwwissit we observe that splitting the closed cases between real recovered persons r r  and dead persons r d  and since the confirmation of recovery needs extra diagnostic tests which are not widely performed yet the most reliable data are those relatet to dead persons r d t which are found to be linked to the total number of confirmed infected cases f t in the following way with   1 7 and a delay time of t d  4 days as show in fig 4  the number of victims follows the number of total confirmed cases and it is equal to 17 of its value four days before the fatality of the sick persons those who exhibit some symptoms is therefore quite high lim t r d t  we present a simple but realistic model for describing epidemic spreading based on the fact that the closed cases come from infected ones at an early time this observation allows us to formulate the problem in terms of a single functional differential equation depending on two well defined clinically relevant parameters the infection rate and the infectiousness time we provide the exact analytical solution for such an equation in the limit of large population number finding that it depends exclusively on the basic reproduction number r 0  rt see eq 8 we derive the analytic solution also in the presence of a generic time-dependent infection rate we apply our model to the case of the spreading of covid-19 in italy allowing the infection rate to vary in time as a result of some containment measures implemented by the government in order to mitigate the consequences of the infection on the population we find perfect agreement between the official data and the expected theoretical results in general terms the basic reproduction number should be suppressed well below 1 in order to rapidly recover the initial condition by a rough estimation in order to have a decline of the infection as fast as its growth containment measures or possible therapies should be so effective to reduce the basic reproduction number and reach the final value r 0f such that r 0f r0i 2r0i1  starting from an initial value r 0 i  in the case of covid-19 in italy the initial value for the basic reproduction number was r 0i 26 while the current one seems to settle at r 0f 08 implying a rather slow decline of the infection finally we discussed the fatality rate showing that the number of victims is exactly a fraction of the total number of cases few days before appendix a solution of the retarded differential equation for t  t the solution of eq 5 is f t  f o e rt  let us consider t  t  dt with infinitesimal dt from eq 5 using this result we can calculate analogously from that we can proceed calculating f t  3dt  f t  2dt  dt r f t  2dt  f 2dt  f o e rt 1  r dt 3  f o r dt 1  r dt 2  e rdt 1  r dt  e 2rdt 22 and going on by adding infinitesimal time steps we find iteratively that with a 1 t  e rt and defining in particular for m dt  t we have an expression for f 2t in terms of the function at early time f 2t  f ta 2 t we can now start again with the iteration one can proceed in the same way as before getting which can be written as where we can notice that at any step t we can perform the same calculation since we can factorize the function f as where therefore f n t  f o n 1 a t and in the continuum limit dt  0 and m   keeping finite the time interval m dt  t reminding that we finally obtain the result reported eq 7 in the presence of time dependent infection rate splitting again the time in n intervals t and the residual time in m infinitesimal intervals dt we define proceeding iteratively as done for the constant rate case but now taking trace of the different values of r after several steps similar to those done previously we find that eq 31 can be generalized in the following way whose continuum limit is given in eq 14 the most commonly used model for epidemic spreading is the so-called sir model which describes the dynamics of the number of susceptible st infected it and recovered rt persons according to the following differential equations with generally the initial condition s0 p the free parameters  the infection rate and  the recovery rate can be fixed by fitting the data sets defining namely that the sum of the three functions is constant and equal to the population p for any t since at the beginning s0  i0  p therefore which is nothing but the logistic term so that eq 40 is exactly equal to eq 3 where   r this implies that one equation among eqs 36-38 is redundant therefore instead of considering three equations one can take just two for instance we can choose to express the time evolution in terms of f t and rt in particular as long as f t p so that 1  f tp  1 from eqs 43 and 44 we have meaning that only if  is smaller than     the infection shuts down one can introduce the so-called basic reproduction number r 0 which predicts whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or die out and represents the average number of cases originated by a single infectious case in a totally susceptible population during the infectiousness period this quantity is defined as and from eq 45 one can see that only for r 0  1 the infection turns off we notice that eq 43 is equal to eq 3 the difference between the delay model described by eqs 3-4  and the sir model described by eqs 43-44 is that in our model the number of closed cases rt is locked to be equal to the total cases at a former time f t  t an average recovery period t before in other words in the delay model eq 44 is substituted by eq 4 which is equivalent to eq 44 with    but with a different initial condition rt  f 0 the delay time allows us to define the basic reproduction number more naturally as the number of new infections during the infectiousness time t on the contrary in the sir model one has to artificially adjust the rate  to take into account the right initial condition  coronavirus disease 2019the principles of the curve explained simply yelda jozaghi   the x axis is a measure of time the y axis represents the number of people affected during that time the rate may it be by infection mortality or recovery depending on the type of curve although this concept of the curve is often referred to as a single entity there are actually various curves a play in a simple way to conceptualize the population dynamics we can define three fundamental curves the infection curve the mortality curve and the recovery curve the infection curve describes the rates of covid19 infection across our society figure 1 the mortality curve describes the mortality rates across society the peak of this curve is offset to the right on the xaxis as compared to the infection curve figure 2 the peak to peak delta xpm xpi will correspond to the average time duration between infection diagnosis and mortality the recovery curve describes the recovery rates across society the peak of this curve is offset to the right on the xaxis as compared with the infection curve figure 3 the peak to peak time difference x will correspond to the average time duration between infection diagnosis and recovery the corresponding peak to peak population ratio deltay will represent the number of people who passed away at the peak the peak to peak ratio y peakrecoveryy peakinfection will represent the recovery rate at the peak of disease figure 3 without discussing the calculus of these functions understanding the area under the curve is integral to conceptualizing these curves the 2dimensional shaded area below the curve will represent the total number of cases we will designate this area as auc depending on the type of curve it will represent the total number of measured infections mortalities and recoveries hence the following formula will apply auc infection  auc mortality  auc recovery in other words the total number of people infected will be equal to the number of people who pass away added to the number of people who recover figure 4 to save lives you must decrease the area under the mortality curve flattening the curve will inherently modify the rates of infection mortality and recovery by flattening the curve with social distancing the shape of the curve is different the slopes of the tangents are different however the area under the curve does not necessarily change flattening the curve can bring down the peak and widen the base maintaining the same auc figure 5 dr robert katz founding director of the yalegriffin prevention research center has been quoted on this topic if all we do is flatten the curve you dont prevent deaths you just change the dates

 this is why to save lives you must decrease the area under the curve flattening the curve does not necessarily achieve that on its own it has the potential to save lives when combined with the following factors avoiding the threshold of hospital capacity is one way by which flattening the curve can save lives

 by threshold of capacity i am referring the maximal number of people the health care system can accommodate once we reach that limit mortality rises not because we could not have saved those lives it rises because we do not have the resources to save them figure 6 basically we cannot all get sick at the same time thats because there arent enough icu beds or ventilators flattening the curve can also potentially save lives because it buys us time until we find a cure preventive vaccine or effective remedy if a cure is found then the auc at the tail end of the flattened infection curve will be larger than that of a nonflattened curve those are effectively less people infected on the infection curve and lives saved on the mortality curve figure 7 the auc after the cure represents the number of people who avoided the illness that number is larger on a flattened curve ergo flattening the curve can save more people from being infected if a cure is found social distancing measures will bring down the peak of the curve figure 8 this consists of building more ventilators increasing the number of icu beds icu personnel emergency room and medical ward capacity figure 9 basically the aim is to raise the threshold of hospital capacity so high that the curve does not cross it an earlier cure in combination with a flattened curve will maximize the number of lives saved figure 10 to be clear such strategies are designed strictly to minimizing mortality across society during the pandemic this article does not discuss strategies on returning to normalcy nevertheless the ideal trigger to transition from one strategy to the other would be the development of a cure such as a vaccine or effective treatment however if this cannot be found in time our only option may be to gradually return to life on the downslope of the curve doing so hoping that herd immunity may provide protection to the vulnerable in such a scenario mathematical modeling could to inform us on which part of the curve would optimize herd immunity and minimize a rebound  the computation of case fatality rate for novel coronavirus covid-19 based on bayes theorem chi-sheng chang yu-tsen yeh tsair-wei chien jui-chung lin john bor-wen cheng shu-chun kuo oliver schildgen   when a new disease eg covid-19 starts to spread many questions emerge how is the virus transmitted how long is the incubation period what is the influence of those asymptomatically infected what is the definite reproductive number ie so-called r0 how long does viral shedding persist after symptoms faded who is at risk for a severe course and how high is the case fatality rate cfr defined as the total number of deaths known by today divided by the total number of known cases confirmed by today7 the cfr is related to the questions how deadly is this and how many people will die in this outbreak sars mers ebola and h1ni yielded a real cfr of 96 34473 and 04 respectively59 the cfr for covid-19 is of interest to numerous researchers71011 due to the underestimated cfr using the formula deathsconfirmed5 particularly at the fast-spreading period several other calculations of cfr were proposed1215 such as deathsdeaths  recoveries and deathscases x days ago where x denotes the lag days from symptom onset to death3 none of the provisional cfrs can accurately predict the real final cfr7 based on the preliminary covid-19 data6 ignoring the underline meaning of the cfr and carelessly reporting imprecise information with cfr deathscases might be biased see the next section the world health organization who in a press conference on january 29 2020 announced the death rate of covid-19 was 2 based on the calculation of cfr deathscases1617 it was substantially underestimated due to assuming no lag days from symptom onset to death and all currently infected cases totally recovered by computing the cfr particularly in the early stages of this covid-19 epidemic11 accordingly many big media platform released news with such statements as belowthe mortality rate for the new coronavirus is about 21 currently far lower than the 96 of sars18 with a fatality rate of around 2 which experts agree appears to be the current level for the virus19 health experts say they are encouraged by the steady rise in the number of recoveries they take it as evidence that the treatments meted out have been effective and that the virus does not appear to be as deadly as sars sars had a mortality rate of 96 percent and about 2 percent of those reported to have been infected with the new coronavirus have died20 the wuhan coronavirus seems to have a low fatality rate and most patients make full recoveries21 the number of confirmed cases and deaths indicates that it is around 2 percent significantly lower than sars 10 percent however many epidemiologists and people who are following this outbreak closely are assuming that its probably quite a bit more widespread than the case counts suggest22 the statements of underestimated cfr that was false and16 motivated us to ask whether this provisional cfr was truly underestimated with false messages to the public and intrigued us to analyze the data with various cfr calculations in this study bayes theorem alternatively bayes law or bayes rule describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event23 for instance the equation  is to estimate the probability of pa1 based on the condition b someone have cancer a1 or death in this study caused by their age pb the age can be used to more accurately assess the probability of cancer than can be done without the knowledge of the age using bayes theorem to estimation in the current study we are motivated to apply bayes theorem to estimate the cfr probability pa1b through the likelihood of the observed events pb such as the level of staff burnouts and healthcare resource scarcities lsbhrs across countriesregions of covid-19 we assumed that supportive treatment is crucial for severe respiratory disease differences in cfrs may be caused by differences in medical resources among a large epidemic versus care of individual cases hence it is hypothesized that the over-loaded burdens of treating patients and capacities to contain the outbreak ie lsbhrs may increase the cfr probability pa1b where a1 denotes the death and b stands for the factor or cause of the death the aims of the current study are to compare the differences of the proposed cfr formula and design an app that allows better understandings of the daily cfr on the covid-19 situations we downloaded covid-19 outbreak numbers in countriesregions on february 14 2020 from the github website24 that contains information on confirmed cases in 30 chinese locations and other countriesregions all downloaded data were publicly deposited on the website24 ethical approval was not necessary for this study because all the data were obtained from the github website on the internet the prior cfr probability eg 002 is denoted by the deaths a1 the remainder a2 is defined by 1  cfr eg 098 see table 1 the goal is to compute the pa1b ie post-cfr in terms of the outbreak lsbhrs pb see fig 1 the lsbhrs is referred to as the next section the shares of the outbreak lsbhrs pb are proportioned in countriesregions based on currently infected cases defined as the confirmed cases subtracted by deaths and recoveries indicating the medical loadings on covid-19 for instance the daily currently infected cases are reported by 4 designated regions as 20 30 50 and 100 respectively the outbreak lsbhrs proportions for 4 regions ie just exampled in this section are thus computed as 012020  30  50  100 015 025 and 05 based on eq 3 see the computation in table 1  where n is the number of regions totallsbhrs means the summation of the outbreak lsbhrs ie the currently infected cases in all regions and lsbhrsj stands for the outbreak lsbhrs in a particular region the summation of proportions of deaths ie a1 in all regions is defined in eq 4  where n is the number of regions totaldeaths means the summation of death tolls in all regions and deaths stand for the number of deaths in a particular region similarly the summation of all recovered proportions ie a2 in all regions is defined in eq 5 see table 1  both proportions ie shares for the deaths ie a1 and the recoveries ie a2 in each region are assumed ie just exampled in this section and allocated as the 2 of 01 02 03 04 and 015 025 03 03 eq 4 see table 1 from eq 1 the cfr can be obtained in eq 6 see table 1  referring to the example in this section the cfr can be computed by the  where pba1  0101  01502  02503  05040315 pba2  01015  015025  02503  0503  02775 eq 3 we can see that the post probability of cfr is increased from the prior probability of 002 to 0023 due to the unequal weights in regions see scenario a in table 1 the final cfr equals the prior cfr at the end of the outbreak see scenario b in table 1 similarly the post-cfr for a region can be obtained by eq 7  where sharea1 is the product of lsbhrs and  and sharea2 equals the product of lsbhrs and  see the example 1 in the next section four scenarios are illustrated in the scenario c in table 1 1  when the prior cfr  004 tj 2  the prior cfr when all lsbhrs loadings in regions are zero see scenario b in table 1 and then let pba1  02501  02502  02503  02504  025 and pba2  025015  025025  02503  02503  025 3 the provisional  the prior cfr when the unweighted deaths and the weighted recoveries are applied see scenario d in table 1 pba1  02510  025 and pba2  02510  025 4 the provisional  if the surveyed pa1 and pa2 of weighted lsbhrs are substantially different such as pba1  06 and pba2  01 where surveyed pa1 or pa2 means the proportion from a survey eg how many percentages are experienced with the severe outbreak lsbhrs eg intensive care unit icu in deaths or in recoveries as such we can apply the formula from 1 to 6 to estimate the post-cfr and verify that unequally weighted lsbhrs loadings cause the cfr probabilitypa1b to increase when  in eq 6 or  in eq 7 we created html pages showing the death counts on a choropleth map all relevant covid-19 information on the countriesareas can be linked to dashboards on google maps when the color is clicked25 the features and limitations were compared among the 5 cfr formulae including the coefficients of variance cv  the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean were applied to measure the relative variability for each cfr the lower is the cv the higher stable is the feature of the cfr computation a dashboard was developed for daily display of the cfr across various regions using the kano model2627 in which 3 features are displayed including the wow feature top one dimension quality middle and the essential requirement bottom the changes between prior and post-cfrs were compared using the kano model2627 when the bayes theorem was applied to compute the post-cfr details are included in additional file 1 with an ms-excel dataset a choropleth map about the distribution of the deaths in regions is present in fig 2 the darker color means a large number of deaths in the region we can see that hubei province in china with a darker red color when the color is clicked a box will pop up and shows that infected  51986 deaths  1318 003 and recoveries  3900 all data were extracted on february 14 2020 three line graphs regarding the cumulative confirmed cases the daily confirmed cased in the recent 7 days and the trend was linked for interested readers to examine the details for more information about the recent covid-19 situations readers are invited to click on the link28 or scan the qr-code in fig 229 in fig 3 we can see that the bayes estimation d has the lowest cv 010 followed by the deathsconfirmed 011 a deathsdeaths  recoveries 042 b combined bayes and deathscases 7 days ago 049 e and deathscases x days ago 059 c see table 2 in which we explained the equations from a to e in details each method will eventually yield an identical cfr over the course of the outbreak some converged from a lower percentage of cfr to a higher one eg a and d other three eg b c and e dropped from a higher cfr to a lower one from fig 3 the combined bayes and deathscases 7 days ago was recommended instead of the lower cfr who claimed and reported by media a dashboard was developed in responding to the daily cfr in comparison to each region the cfr 37 with purple color greater than the whos 2 was shown on our developed dashboards based on data of february 14 2020 using bays estimation on axis y and prior cfr on axis x in fig 4 from this we can compare the daily cfrs for each region other cfrs eg deathsconfirmed cases on 7 days ago and deathsdeaths  recoveries are present when the bubble of interest is clicked interested readers are invited to scan the qr-code in fig 4 and see the details by clicking the bubble of interest from fig 4 we can see that all bubbles sized by the post-cfr were within the one-dimensional band using the kano model indicating both prior- and post-cfrs were almost equal to each other the black bubbles would denote the post-cfrs equal to zero even if the prior-cfrs were significantly higher toward the right-hand side on axis x the highest prior-cfr 33 is the philippines on february 14 2020 because 3 were infected and 1 died the highest post  cfr was hubei china with post-cfr  366 higher than the prior-cfr  254 indicating the heavy loadings of the outbreak lsbhrs leads to a higher probability of the post-cfr it is worth noting that the prior-cfr is derived from the deathsconfirmed by today and the post-cfr is yielded by eq 6 the post-cfr 37 greater than the prior cfr of 22 on february 14 and equal to 37 on march 13 was evident of the outbreak lsbhrs increasing the cfr due to weighted scheme applied see table 1 the recent cfrs were online computed in fig 5 where prior cfrs are shown on axis x and post-cfrs on axis y the highest prior-cfr was located in suan with 1 died and 1 confirmed case on march 13 2020 see the right-top corner fig 5 all bubbles are sized by the post-cfrs and colored the areas in the kano diagram for instance bubbles in the one-dimensional area are colored in blue the global with the big purple bubble had an increase from the prior cfr 371 to the post cfr 327 in comparison to hubei china having a decrease from the prior cfr  4521 to the post cfr  352 on march 13 2020 due to the outbreak lsbhrs in deaths relatively lower than that in recoveries three countries outside the one-dimensional area are italy spain and france with significantly relative post-cfrs more than the prior-cfrs the recent cfrs are shown on google maps when the qr-code is scanned in figs 4 and 5 we observed that the bayes estimation d has the lowest cv 010 followed by the deathsconfirmed 011 deathsdeaths  recovered 042 b bayes based on deathscases  days ago 049 e and deathscases 7 days ago 059 c all final cfrs will be equal the cfr 37 greater than the prior-cfr of 22 was evident in lsbhrs impact on the cfr a dashboard was created to present the cfrs a dashboard was designed to respond to the daily overall cfr each individual cfr can be viewed by clicking the bubble of interest3031 we found that the method d has the lowest cv 010 and the c has the highest cv 059 the e bayes based on deathscases 7 days ago 049 is suggested to calculate the provisional cfr to the general public the reason for use is illustrated in the next section cfr is a measure of the severity of a disease and is defined as the proportion of cases of a specified disease or condition which are fatal16 we believe that who voiced the cfr 217 with misinformation ie underestimation which is only based on confirmed cases ignoring the lag time between the onset of symptoms and progression to deaths as well as in mild cases assuming the lsbhrs being equal across countriesregions who did not explain to the media and public what cfr implicates the understated cfr has been shared worldwide1822 it is clear that the conventional cfr defined as deathscases in the current fast-growing epidemic gives us a totally useless and unreliable figure when it comes to an outbreak like covid-19 in the past 50 days since february 14 2020 the real fatality rate is hard to estimate because we have many currently infected cases yet known the distributions on age sex and other factors such as the proportion of severity in intensive care units icu and patients with multiple comorbidities and the cfr taking into account those clinically diagnosed cases as confirmed cases determined in hubei since february 14 202032 what who and media did by publishing cfr 2 has served to avoid public panic for a period of time by displaying the comparison of data with the true cfrs of sars 96 mers 344 ebola 73 and h1ni 0459 however true and final cfrs are usually much bigger than the provisional cfrs according to the sars experience when who first reported daily statistics the sars death rate was about 2 it was 24 on march 17 and 18 on march 18 in 200333 in april 2003 cfr was increased to 56 instead of an initial 18 the final cfr in the middle of the summer 2003 raised up to almost 1033 that is the reason why we suggested using the bayes based on deathscases 7 days ago in reporting the provisional cfr to the general public through this we can avoid the negative effect of the underestimated cfr and prepare the population including doctors authorities and epidemiologists etc to face the real threat of covid-19 dr michael ryan executive director of who addressed that the covid-19 fatality rate is 2 in a press conference on january 29 202016 however most of the confirmed cases of this novel coronavirus are still hospitalized many of them in icus the virus does not kill a person immediately hence creating a lag between infection confirmation and death16 for example only patients that had died by today february 14 2020 would have been taken into account in the provisional cfr but these individuals would have been registered as confirmed cases a few days or more than a week ago the provisional cfr is therefore underestimated due to the potential deaths of currently confirmed cases in the next couple of days aka lag days34 as the number of death increased the death rate has also steadily risen leaving the officials worried based on the cfr trend calculated as deathscases see fig 3upper due to the imprecise and carelessness in the calculation the media has misled the public that cfr of 2 on covid-19 is less than the 10 in sars1621 although we compared the final cfr for the sars epidemic with current cfr for covid-19 on the same basis of deathscases what has been forgotten is that cfr was 18 for sars on an early stage in 2003 epidemic calculated using this underestimated method the current calculation of cfr for a growing epidemic stage is not suitable for representing the final cfr an adjusted cfr is required in an epidemic to better elucidate the outbreak we suggest that in a fast-growing epidemic cfr cannot be used at all when referring to cv or the slop of the cfr trend eg in fig 3 if the true cfr managed to reach over 10 while the provisional cfr was just under 3 it makes no sense to use such definition in the calculation of cfr deathscases the best way to calculate the provisional cfr is based on cases that already concluded by either death or recovery however the epidemic is spreading fast and there is not enough time to collect data on how many patients of first say 100 patients recovered and died by any particular day examining the interception of the 2 trends fig 6 might be a reference to predict the final cfr which should be evident in the future with this change it is hopeful that the public would not be misinformed again in our suggested cfr calculation of the method of bayes based on deathscases 7 days ago 3 pivotal components have been focused in the current study assuming unequal lsbhrs proportions based on the daily no-outcome-yet cases across all countriesregions in covid-19 using bayes theorem to adjust the daily provisional cfr and observing whether the cfr trend has been flatted at stationarity phase ie approaching real cfr considering the lag time between symptom to death as the thread alerted at the fast-growing ie beginning period although it is hard to accurately estimate the provisional cfr because we do not know the distributions of age severity number in icu etc an appropriate death lag time eg 7 days was designed in this study the longer this estimated period is the higher the provisional cfr will be316 as with all forms of web-based technology advances in health communication technology are happening every moment35 the provisional cfr shown on a dashboard is practical and worth replicating in other fields of a disease outbreak as we demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 interested readers are recommended to scan the qr codes in figs 46 and read the details about the corresponding line graph on trends of the outbreak our study has some limitations first although the data were downloaded from google sheet on a daily basis we are concerned with different criteria for determining confirmed cases among regions that affect the cfr for instance the confirmed cases are from clinically diagnosed cases in hubei since february 14 202032 second although we applied bayes theorem to estimate the provisional cfr using eqs from 1 to 5 the post-cfr calculated by bayes theorem eq 6 is strongly related to the prior  cfr the result due to lsbhrs among regions drives a little bit of increase compared with the cfr calculated by the deaths over cases assuming all medical resources and staff burnout are equal the bayes based on deathscases 7 days ago suggested in this study is worthy of investigation in the future third the study was based on the data from the github website24 the google team has announced that the service will be terminated and transformed into github24 providing the same information due to the download limit the google team will soon stop the update of this google sheet which might affect the data being transferred effectively and efficiently on the daily calculated cfr eg in figs 4 and 5 fourth the post-cfrs calculated by bayes theorem in fig 4 confused us with the gap from the prior-cfrs resulted from the deathsconfirmed by today such as the philippines 0 33 with confirmed  3 deaths  1 and recovered  1 owing to the lsbhrs 3-1-164460 substantially relatively less than hubei china 51986-1318-390064460 366 254 with confirmed  51986 deaths  1318 recovered  3900 the expected cfr for the philippines thus sharply decreases after computation based on bayes theorem finally we suggest examining the interception of the 2 trends fig 6 as a reference to the final cfr which should be further verified in the future we suggest examining the interception of the 2 trends of the bayes based on both deathscases 7 days ago and deathconfirmed cases as a reference to the final cfr an app developed for displaying the provisional cfr with the 2 cfr trends is encouraged to ameliorate the underestimated cfr reported by who and media the authors thank enago wwwenagotw for the english language review

orthopedic surgery post covid-19 an opportunity for innovation and transformation mariano menendez e andrew jawa derek haas a jon warner j p   1 from the codman shoulder society 1 as the scale of the coronavirus pandemic continues to grow so does the amount of 2 uncertainty this virus has upended life as we know it and we as surgeons are not particularly 3 good at dealing with uncertainty 11 while uncertainty is the norm in areas such as business 4 forecasting and stock price valuations we feel uneasy when grappling with tough questions such 5 as whether to cancel elective surgeries that arent immediately life-threatening but could result 6 in more serious complications down the line take for instance cholecystectomy to remove 7 symptomatic gallstones failure to provide timely definitive treatment may increase the risk of 8 potentially life-threatening pancreatitis 12 how about delaying timely repair of an acute rotator 9 cuff tear in a young patient which likely could impact the outcome it can be hard to draw the 10 line for what is critical urgent or non-urgent surgical care many questions remain unanswered 11 but this crisis also presents value-maximizing opportunities for innovation in the delivery 12 of healthcare with orthopedic surgery as a particular segment presenting opportunity for value 13 creation 14 the current period of turbulence and fear may be a learning experience for providers 15 industry and patients it may promote collaboration and creative thinking that could spur 16 changes in behavior such changes would potentially create value for all stakeholders 17 here we would like to share our thoughts of some changes that may permanently impact 18 orthopedic surgery going forward we group these changes into three broad categories 1 19 technology-aided replacement of in-person services with virtual ones 2 a greater shift in 20 surgeries from hospitals to surgery centers and 3 increased pressure to be cost-conscious and 21 to follow evidence-based medicine guidelines change associated with the coronavirus outbreak initial telehealth-related concerns regarding 25 insurance resistance billing complexities and privacy have evaporated as everyone is now 26 striving to keep providers and patients separate we believe that long-lagging telehealth is here 27 to stay and will become the norm for orthopedic surgery and there is early encouraging 28 evidence of its use for postoperative visits after rotator cuff repair 4 even before this outbreak 29 our group was doing a study in collaboration with harvard business school looking at the safety 30 and effectiveness of virtual visits during the 90-day post-acute care period following shoulder 31 surgery it was evident that most patients who underwent rotator cuff repair as well as shoulder 32 arthroplasty simply did not need to return to the office during this period in fact we could easily 33 see their surgical wound and instruct them how to self-examine themselves to alert us if there 34 was an issue moreover it was evident to us that this would free up office capacity ultimately 35 affecting the patient experience and cost-effectiveness of clinic utilization overall 36 b decreased utilization of formal physical therapy there is little evidence that the 37 amount of formal physical therapy after orthopedic surgery correlates with an improved ultimate 38 recovery 8 we believe that home-based physical therapy surrogates through digital tools will 39 facilitate recovery for patients increase compliance and ultimately optimize costs and outcomes 40 virtual coaching with feedback and videos uploaded to media-sharing platforms such as 41 youtube will reduce the need for as much hands-on physical therapy as we have come to 42 expect moreover some companies are creating new technology inclusive of wearable devices 43 that interface with new computer monitoring programs to allow careful management of virtual 44 recovery with physical therapy one such example is pt genie httpsptgeniecom beachwood c online tools for postoperative recovery we and others are creating interactive 47 modules either through third parties or through our own institutions that will concierge patients 48 through their recovery this may include apps and websites with interactive input that identify 2 a greater shift in surgeries from hospitals to surgery centers there is mounting evidence 77 that ambulatory surgery centers can maximize the value of most orthopedic surgery procedures 78 including shoulder arthroplasty 1 2 following the outbreak there will be such a backlog of cases 79 in hospitals that many of them will get shifted to surgery centers as surgeons get increasingly 80 comfortable performing more procedures such as shoulder or knee and hip arthroplasty in 81 surgery centers they will want to keep doing them there patients are likely going to increasingly 82 prefer a surgery center--where there are no coronavirus patients--to a hospital as well 83 similarly patients may be more motivated to go home after surgery and avoid post-acute care 84 facilities to minimize the risk of contracting the virus 85 a increased cost pressure within hospitals there will be more pressure to tightly 87 manage costs within hospitals this will initially be driven by the coronavirus for instance the 88 stock prices of the two largest hospital chains in the united states hca and tenet declined by 89 roughly twice as much as the sp 500 from the end of 2019 through march 27 2020 the 90 coronavirus pandemic continues for more than a few months it is unlikely to be sufficient to 93 stem the financial losses experienced by hospitals even now in the midst of the crisis some 94 hospitals are already cutting back on the compensation of their physicians and staff once we are 95 through the coronavirus crisis hospitals will likely continue to face financial pressure due to the 96 migration of profitable orthopedic cases from hospitals to surgery centers 97 in order to survive economically hospitals will need to adopt more cost-conscious and 98 effective practices identifying these practices will require the use of sophisticated clinical and 99 operational analytics and advanced cost measurement methodologies such as time-driven 100 activity-based costing 7 one of the first targets will be orthopedic implant costs given the wide 101 variability and lack of transparency in their purchase prices across institutions 3 102 surgery is based more on anecdotal than empirical evidence the considerable accumulation of 104 cases after the outbreak may prompt stricter adherence to evidence-based practice guidelines as 105 to who to prioritize for surgery this will create an opportunity to decrease unwarranted variation 106 of orthopedic procedures that provide questionable value to certain patients eg arthroscopic 107 partial meniscectomy for degenerative meniscal tears 10 subacromial decompression for shoulder 108 impingement 5  however it is important to note that rigid approaches to care that dont allow for 109 any adaptation may pose barriers to innovation now actually may be a great time to innovate 110 either fail fast or allow the patients to reap the benefits creative thinking will be needed to 111 accelerate progress after this outbreak and innovation is critical to creating future evidence 9 112 for too long healthcare has been a nidus for inefficient use of time and resources the 113 future may not permit this in the united states any longer no one knows exactly what will come of the coronavirus pandemic but this was our best stab at some of the unexpected ways that 115 orthopedic surgery may change for the good 116  linear regression analysis to predict the number of deaths in india due to sars-cov-2 at 6 weeks from day 0 100 cases - march 14th 2020 samit ghosal sumit sengupta milan majumder binayak sinha   the pandemic of covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 caused by sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has created a havoc on the human civilization since its appearance in the city of wuhan hebei district in china it has been a relentless march of new cases and deaths 1 what makes it more scary is the novel strain of the virus and the unknowns associated with it 2 the present strategy has been to prevent its spread by social isolation and a scientific overdrive to manufacture newer rapid diagnostic kits as well as medications 3 4 5 coronavirus belongs to a family of rna viruses within the virus family coronaviridae order nidovirales 6 coronaviruses are divided into three groups depending on the antigenic spikes produced by different protein structures of the virus spike membrane  nucleocapsid 7 the sars coronavirus falls under group 2 the ability of this family of viruses to readily undergo genetic recombination not only within same group but also between group makes them readily susceptible to natural selection and changing its nature of virulence 8 the most striking feature however is its ability to freely cross from one species to another hcov 229 e belongs to the group 1 of the coronaviruses family thought to be responsible for the epidemic of common cold 7 transmission from bats to humans is thought to be the initial transmission process for hcov 229 e which had happened within the last two centuries however the two dramatic events- sars-cov originated from bats and got transmitted from civet cats  mers-cov originated from bats and got transmitted from camels in 2003 and 2012 respectively brough our focus back on the coronavirus family 89 the present coronavirus pandemic is the result of changes in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein component via natural selection in human hostin animal vector resulting in its increased affinity for the ace2 receptor site 10 at present we have more than 450000 individuals affected with cov-2 resulting in more than 12000 deaths worldwide 11 in india as the present day statistics holds we have around 718 confirmed cases with 13 deaths 12 several countries including india have gone into a state of lockdown in order to prevent spread of this deadly virus with new rapid-diagnostic kits coming in and trials with potentially helpful drugs underway we need a better understanding of the disease process and what it holds for the near future with all the cov-2 related data available through reliable sources we choose to assimilate the available data on total infection rates total deaths case fatality rates cfr recovery numbers from across the globe and create a predictive analysis on what we can expect in india in the coming weeks the aim was to identify the top 15 countries ie those most heavily affected and hence could contribute to a substantial quantity of robust data and compute a predictive model for india we thought this was of paramount importance since it would help understanding as well as planning for the future course of action india has entered week 4 this analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the covid-19 in india there was one missing data na in the dataset which was the recovery numbers from the us in view of the heterogeneity of data and significant outliers data imputation with mean was ruled out as a recovery strategy a correlation analysis was conducted leaving out the us data using python and a strong r  099 p  0001 was found between total number of infected cases and recovery utilising this robust association and the formula generated from linear regression y recovery cases  usa  b0  b1 total cases  usa with b0  -78105 and b1  0869 the missing value 1117 was derived the analysis was conducted thereafter table 1
 
step 1 correlation study was conducted to ascertain the relationship between the output week 6 death counts and the input variables from week 4 a good correlation was observed with all the input variablesstep 2 multiple regression analysis was done to ascertain the strength of association between the input variables and the output including ruling out issues related to multi-collinearity once again the model created was very robust with r  095 r2  091  adjusted r2  086 table 5 however the p-value for significance was not evident for any of the input variablesstep 3 auto-regression technique- the 5th week death count data was incorporated as the input variable in view of the fact that this end-point was significantly associated with the week 4 death count a separate correlation analysis was performed between week 5 and week 6 death counts and a very robust association r  097 was found justifying its inclusion as the input variablestep 4 using week 5 death count as input a simple linear regression was performed to create a model predicting the week 6 outcomes the model was robust r  096 r2  094 adjusted r2  094 and statistically significant p-value 0001 95 ci 113154step 5 from the regression model formula the minimum maximum and average death count was estimated table 6 the average predicted death count for india was estimated to be 467
 assessing the trends of the top 15 most infected countries a predictive model was created for india assuming that the same trend would follow in other words can we justify the drastic measures being taken what can we expect if we allow the present trend to continue and mimic the exponential growth experienced by china and our western counterparts our analysis predicts a jump from approximately 10 deaths at week 4211 at week 5 and then 467 by week 6 we speculate the need for urgent interventions which are being taken as of now to prevent this drastic and sharp rise in death rates which indirectly also indicates an increase in infection rate the main limitation of this analysis was that it takes most input data into consideration without taking into account the logistic actions being taken or not taken during the process however the end of weeks results are highly indicative of both the virus-related natural trajectory as well as the local governments reactions secondly limiting our analysis to the top 15 most infected countries could lead to an over-estimation of the outcomes however faced with a catastrophe of such magnitude it is worth over-estimating rather than under-estimating in spite of all the limitations the biggest strength of this study was very high adjusted r2 found in all the predictive models in addition there was cross-validation with two different software practically ruling out any error creeping in from one mode of analysis according to our analysis if situation continue in present state projected death rate n is 211 and 467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now respectively keeping these projected mortality data in mind current measured for containment of covid-19 must be strengthened or supplemented none none to declare  incomplete and late recovery of sudden olfactory dysfunction in covid-19 eduardo kosugi macoto joel lavinsky fabrizio romano ricci marco fornazieri aurlio gabriela luz-matsumoto ricci marcus lessa miranda otavio piltcher geraldo santanna druck   human coronaviruses hcovs were first identified in the nasal cavities of patients with the common cold in the 1960s1 being responsible for 10 to 15 of these cases second only to rhinoviruses2 although most cases of hcov infection show symptoms compatible with the common cold or mild flu-like syndromes the lower respiratory tract can be severely affected as in outbreaks caused by the sars-cov mers-cov species and now with the new coronavirus sars- cov-2 which causes the covid-19 disease1 in china the analysis of 72314 cases up to february 11 2020 showed that 14 of patients with covid-19 had severe disease and 5 were critically ill leading to a case fatality rate of 233 in brazil at the beginning of may 2020 there were already more than 145000 confirmed cases with a case fatality rate reaching 684
 in addition to respiratory symptoms an unusual finding started to be noticed in patients with covid-19 sudden anosmia a study focusing on neurological alterations showed only 51 of changes in smell in patients hospitalized with covid-19 in wuhan china5 compatible with a prevalence of 58 of anosmia in population studies6 however in europe 856 of patients with mild to moderate covid-19 had a sudden change in olfaction with 796 anosmia and 204 hyposmia7 this finding did not seem to follow the usual pattern of post-viral olfaction alterations in the usa a study comparing patients with flu-like symptoms showed a 16 prevalence of post-viral olfaction alteration which increased to 68 in positive-covid-19 patients8 similar to the european and in disagreement with the chinese data interestingly in the first study using olfactory tests in these patients carried out in iran the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction assessed in those infected with sars-cov-2 reached 989
 the reports of sudden anosmia by covid-19 led the brazilian academy of rhinology abr academia brasileira de rinologia and the brazilian association of otorhinolaryngology and cervical-facial surgery aborl-ccf associao brasileira de otorrinolaringologia e cirurgia crvico-facial to issue the 4th guidance note to otorhinolaryngologists in relation to the disease caused by the new coronavirus covid-19 on march 22 2020 advising that the presence of sudden anosmia with or without ageusia and without concomitant nasal obstruction could suggest the presence of covid-19 in this scenario of pandemic and sustained transmission of the sars-cov-2 virus10
 considering this new clinical presentation of covid-19 and the possible variation in susceptibility to anosmia caused by the sars-cov-2 virus in different populations it is necessary to assess the characteristics of sudden olfactory dysfunction in this context of the covid-19 pandemic in the brazilian population as there is to date no brazilian data on this topic moreover little is known about the evolution of sudden loss of olfaction related to covid-19 thus the aim of this study was to characterize patients who experienced sudden olfactory dysfunction during the covid-19 pandemic and in particular their recovery an online survey was developed by aborl-ccf and abr to be filled out by physicians who treated patients with sudden olfactory dysfunction starting on february 1 2020 in brazil in this context of the covid-19 pandemic the research investigated the epidemiological profile of patients with sudden anosmia or hyposmia associated symptoms comorbidities treatment used recovery from sudden anosmia or hyposmia if there was a test to confirm covid-19 and the result of this test the survey was distributed digitally by aborl-ccf via its website wwwaborlccforgbr whatsapp and instagram data were collected between march 25 and april 30 2020 the participating physicians were asked for authorization to use the included data data on the recovery from sudden anosmia or hyposmia and test for covid-19 were confirmed via e-mail and information on the time for total recovery from anosmia or hyposmia and how long the patient was followed by the doctor were also collected symptom prevalence rates were described in percentages whereas continuous variables such as duration of complaints and age were described in medians and interquartile range iqr proportions were compared using fishers exact or chi-square test the difference in age distribution time to total recovery and duration of patient follow-up were calculated using the mann-whitney u test due to the non-normal distribution of data calculated by the kolmogorov-smirnov test the level of significance was set at 5 and the tests used were two-tailed a total of 253 patients was included treated in all regions of brazil distributed as follows 142 561 in the southeast 59 233 in the northeast 32 126 in the south 10 40 in the north and 10 40 in the midwest there was a predominance of women 149 patients - 589 and the median age was 36 years iqr 3044 years most patients had sudden anosmia 212 patients - 838 instead of sudden hyposmia and in most cases 196 patients - 775 loss of smell was accompanied by nonspecific inflammatory symptoms coughing fever headache fatiguemalaise myalgiaarthralgia andor anorexia nasal symptoms nasal obstruction sneezing coryza purulent rhinorrhea nasal pruritus and  or nasal burning were reported by 111 patients 439 and sore throat by 16 63 only 364 of the patients reported comorbidities with rhinitis being the most frequent one 53 patients - 209 followed by asthma and systemic arterial hypertension sah with 13 patients each 51 chronic rhinosinusitis was reported by 7 patients 28 the treatment was expectant in most cases 124 patients - 490 when opting for some treatment nasal saline irrigation nsi was the one most frequently chosen 66 patients - 261 followed by analgesics  antipyretics in 30 patients 119 topical intranasal corticosteroids incs in 28 patients 111 antibiotics in 22 patients 87 oral corticosteroids oral cs in 12 patients 47 hydroxychloroquine in 6 patients 24 oseltamivir in 5 patients 20 and olfactory training in 5 patients 20 the information on the recovery of the sudden olfactory dysfunction was obtained from 227 records 897 121 patients with full recovery 533 76 with partial recovery 335 and 30 with no recovery 132 when there was full recovery the time to achieve this result showed a median of 125 days iqr 9252075 days additionally the time of follow-up lasted a median of 31 days iqr 10539 days most patients 183 723 were tested for confirmation of covid-19 with 145 792 positive and 38 208 negative results the untested patients were younger median of 34 years vs 36 years p
  005 with more isolated anosmia 257 vs 71 p
  00001 fewer nonspecific inflammatory symptoms 543 vs 863 p
  00001 and shorter time of follow-up median 15 days vs 315 days p
  0007 than the tested patients sub-analyses were performed between positive- and negative-covid-19 patients there were no differences regarding epidemiological characteristics between positive- and negative-covid-19 patients as shown in table 1
 positive-covid-19 patients more commonly had nonspecific inflammatory symptoms coughing fever headache fatiguemalaise myalgiaarthralgia andor anorexia than negative-covid-19 ones 897 vs 737 p
  002 there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for the other symptoms as shown in table 2
 there were also no differences regarding the patterns of treatment used in the two groups of patients sudden olfactory dysfunction in the positive-covid-19 patients showed a lower full recovery rate fig 1
 and a longer duration than in the negative-covid-19 ones table 3
 full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction was less frequent in the positive-covid-19 than in the negative-covid-19 patients 526 vs 703 p
  005 and the time to achieve full recovery from the sudden olfactory dysfunction was longer in the positive-covid-19 than in the negative-covid-19 patients median of 15 days vs 10 days p
  00006 although the time of follow-up was not different between positive- and negative-covid-19 patients median 31 days vs 355 days p
  037 when analyzing only positive-covid-19 patients it was observed that those with hyposmia recovered more easily than the ones with anosmia table 4
 there was no difference in the full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction due to the different treatments used and that there was no association between full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction due to the presence or absence of other symptoms this is the first brazilian study to assess sudden olfactory dysfunction in the context of the covid-19 pandemic the most relevant finding in the present study was the demonstration that the sudden olfactory dysfunction associated with covid-19 had a lower rate of full recovery and a longer duration than in negative-covid-19 patients only half of the positive-covid-19 patients fully recovered olfaction compared to 703 of the negative-covid-19 ones p
  005 considering only those who fully recovered the olfaction it took positive-covid-19 patients 15 days median to fully recover their sense of smell 5 days longer than negative-covid-19 ones p
  00006 the second relevant point is that the full recovery from sudden hyposmia in positive-covid-19 patients occurred more frequently than that from sudden anosmia p
  004 women have complained more about loss of olfaction during the covid-19 pandemic representing up to three quarters of the cases11 which however is reduced to two-thirds when there is diagnostic confirmation of covid-197 the present research included a total of 591 of women with olfactory dysfunction being 531 when positive-covid-19 cases were confirmed however it is interesting to mention that population studies tend to show a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in men6 this skewed distribution of loss of smell in covid-19 may be due to the decreased capacity of men to perceive the olfactory dysfunction or even womens greater concern for their health or an actual selectivity of sars-cov-2 for the female gender another discrepant point between the olfactory dysfunction related to covid-19 and that found in the general population is the anosmia hyposmia ratio the prevalence of hyposmia is usually more than two-fold that of anosmia6 but the studies by hopkins et al11 and lechien et al7 showed that 744 and 769 of the olfactory dysfunction cases related to covid-19 were those of anosmia not hyposmia in agreement with that 834 of olfaction complaints in the present study were of anosmia reaching 869 in positive-covid-19 patients although hcovs are the second most frequent cause of acute nasopharyngitis2 sars-cov-2 does not seem to predominantly promote nasal or pharyngeal conditions7 8 11 12 13 hence the recommendation made by the 4th guidance note of abr  aborl-ccf was to always suspect covid-19 in the current scenario in cases of sudden anosmia that was not accompanied by nasal obstruction10 however among the positive-covid-19 patients in this study 275 had nasal obstruction concomitantly therefore we should not exclude the possibility of covid-19 just because the patient has upper airway symptoms sore throat was uncommon in the present study 69 vs 105 p
  056 according to the findings of yan et al8 who showed that sore throat was independently associated with negative-covid-19 patients with these patients being 4 to 5 times more likely to report sore throat as a symptom than the positive ones nonspecific inflammatory symptoms such as coughing headache fever myalgiaarthralgia and fatigue are usually the most prevalent ones in covid-197 8 11 12 13 in the present study positive-covid-19 patients with sudden olfactory dysfunction had more general inflammatory symptoms with coughing headache and fever being the most common ones than negative-covid-19 patients 897 vs 737 p
  002 corroborating the supposition that sars-cov-2 causes predominantly nonspecific inflammatory symptoms sudden olfactory dysfunction alone with no other symptoms is not the norm hopkins et al11 showed that only 16 of patients had sudden olfactory dysfunction without other symptoms consistent with our global finding of 121 of isolated anosmiahyposmia in the context of the pandemic it is worth mentioning that among our positive-covid-19 patients only 55 had isolated sudden olfactory dysfunction dyspnea was not a frequent finding in the present study which may represent the inclusion of a profile of patients with mild to moderate disease moreover the presence of sudden anosmia seems to be related to the milder forms of covid-19 as shown by yan et al13 alterations in taste were not objectively assessed in this research which may justify its low prevalence when compared to studies that showed high rates of ageusia associated with sudden anosmia in covid-19 cases8 13
 hopkins et al in a study with a similar design showed that 801 of the patients with sudden olfactory dysfunction had some degree of olfactory recovery one week after the research thus showing that it is likely that the olfaction will recover well in this covid-19 pandemic scenario however full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction was reported by only 115 of the patients and only 53 of patients in the study were tested for covid-19 making it difficult to extrapolate the data14 our global data also showed high rates of some reported degree of olfactory recovery 868 over a 31-day follow-up period median but this does not mean full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction that is return to the levels before the sudden loss of smell which is desired by patients and doctors considering that 183 patients 723 were tested for covid-19 it was possible to compare the result of sudden loss of smell between positive- and negative-covid-19 patients positive-covid-19 patients had a lower full recovery rate from sudden olfactory dysfunction than negative-covid-19 ones 526 vs 703 p
  005 moreover positive-covid-19 patients who managed to attain full recovery took 5 days longer than negative ones median 15 days vs 10 days p
  00006 therefore our data showed that sars-cov-2 infection caused a type of sudden olfactory dysfunction that was more difficult to resolve than sudden anosmiahyposmia in negative-covid-19 patients which may possibly represent other post-viral olfaction losses since in the present sample only 132 of negative-covid-19 patients did not have other associated infection symptoms there are no data on the recovery of post-viral sudden olfactory dysfunction in the acute phase therefore the present study may bring new data in this sense as well the present study also showed that sudden hyposmia in the positive-covid-19 patients had a better evolution than those with sudden anosmia also an unprecedented finding in the literature testing for covid-19 is not the norm in outpatients in most countries so much so that previous studies of sudden olfactory dysfunction in covid-19 with questionnaires showed low rates of tested patients included in the studies ranging from 33 to 5311 14
 the present study involved 723 of patients tested for covid-19 the untested patients had a more benign profile younger age and fewer associated symptoms which probably led to the shorter time of follow-up and possibly to the lack of testing due to the difficulties experienced in the pandemic for this purpose the positive points of the present study were the inclusion of a large sample of patients with sudden olfactory dysfunction with a large percentage of patients being tested for covid-19 and with a median follow-up of one month to assess the recovery from sudden olfaction loss the negative point lies in the purely subjective analysis of sudden anosmia or hyposmia which is not as reliable as the psychophysical tests of olfaction evaluation15 on the other hand these more sensitive tests can indicate changes in olfaction in more than 50 of individuals without olfactory complaints16 and ultimately it is the subjective perception of ones sense of smell that matters to the patient the sudden olfactory dysfunction in positive-covid-19 patients showed a lower total recovery rate and longer duration than in negative-covid-19 patients only half of the positive-covid-19

transmission dynamics in china the biological susceptibility to the infection seems limited among children intermediate among young to mid-age adults but high among those 50 years of age there was no evidence for differential contact mixing by age consistent with most transmission occurring in households rather than in schools or workplaces  an outbreak of a novel coronavirus strain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was identified in wuhan hubei province china in late december 2019 1 2  the outbreak started with identification of four cases of severe pneumonia of unknown etiology but with symptoms similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers 1 3  initial cases were linked to exposure at the huanan seafood market but subsequent infections resulted from rapid community transmission 1 2 3  within about two months over 80000 cases and 3000 deaths occurred across china 2 4  amid extreme preventive measures and outstanding healthcare mobilization 2 3  the resulting disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-2019 by the world health organization who 5  and has been declared a pandemic 6 after affecting tens of countries and territories 4  for simplicity we will thereafter refer to this virus as covid-19 though it is the name of the disease form given its prevalent current use in the public sphere and to avoid confusion between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the aims of this study are to investigate and characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of covid-19 in china including 1 age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to infection 2 age-assortativeness in infection transmission and 3 transition in the rate of infectious contacts and reproduction number following the introduction of mass interventions a deterministic compartmental mathematical model was constructed to describe covid-19 transmission dynamics in a given population and was applied here to the population of china  figure s1 of supplementary information si the model was designed based on current understanding of the infections natural history and epidemiology the model consists of a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations that stratify the population into compartments according to age group infection status infection stage and disease stage analyses were performed in matlab r2019a 7  the model stratified the population into nine age groups each representing a ten-year age band except for the last category 0-9 10-19  80 years susceptible individuals in each age group are at risk of being exposed to the infection at varying hazard rates which are age-and timedependent to capture the variability in the risk of exposure and the impact of public health interventions following a latency period infected individuals are stratified to develop mild infection followed by recovery or severe infection followed by severe disease then recovery or critical infection followed by critical disease and either recovery or disease mortality the model parameterized the variation in the rate of infectious contacts through a woods-saxon function 8 9 10 11 to characterize the transition after chinas robust public health response in terms of its scale or strength smoothness or abruptness duration and the turning point the model also incorporated an age mixing matrix that allows a range of contact mixing between individuals varying from fully assortative mixing only with individuals in the same age group to fully proportionate mixing with individuals with no preferential bias for a specific age group the latter was incorporated to capture any assortativeness in infection transmission mixing by age further details on model structure can be found in section 1 of si the model was parameterized using current data on covid-19 natural history and epidemiology the duration of latent infection was set at 369 days based on an existing estimate 12 and based on a median incubation period across confirmed cases of 51 days 1  adjusted for the observed viral load among infected persons following exposure 13 and reported infection transmission prior to onset of symptoms 14  the age-stratified proportions of infected individuals that will eventually progress to develop mild severe or critical infections were based on the observed distribution of cases across these infection stages in china 3 15 16  the duration of infectiousness was assumed to last for 348 days based on an existing estimate 12 and based on the observed time to recovery in persons with mild infection 3 12 and the observed viral load among infected persons 13 14  individuals with severe or critical infections develop severe or critical disease over a period of 28 days prior to recovery as informed by the observed duration from onset of severe or critical disease to recovery 3  individuals with critical disease had the additional risk of disease mortality 17  the disease mortality rate was fitted factoring the observed crude case fatality rate in each age group in china as of february 11 2020 2 17  the population size demographic structure age distribution and life expectancy of the population of china as of 2020 were obtained from the united nations world population prospects database 18  further details on model parameters values and justifications can be found in tables s1 and s2 and section 2 of si the model was fitted to the following sources of data 1 time series of diagnosed covid-19 cases and of the cumulative number of diagnosed covid-19 cases and of recovered individuals 3  2 time series of reported covid-19 deaths and of the cumulative number of covid-19 deaths 3  and 3 relative attack rate by age that is the proportion of the population that has already been infected by february 11 2020 stratified by age 17  chinas reported cases and deaths were adjusted to reflect the change in coronavirus case definition to include in addition to the laboratory-confirmed cases those who are clinically-diagnosed 19 20 section 2 of si model fitting was used to estimate the infectious contact rate age-stratified susceptibility to the infection degree of assortativeness in the age group mixing overall attack rate overall disease mortality rate time delay between onset of actual infection and case notification and between actual death and reported death and transition in the basic reproduction number 0 r  a nonlinear least-square data fitting method based on the nelder-mead simplex algorithm was used to minimize the sum of squares between data points and model predictions 21  a multivariable uncertainty analysis was conducted to determine the range of uncertainty around model predictions five-hundred simulation runs were performed applying at each run latin hypercube sampling from a multidimensional distribution of the model parameters where parameter values are selected from ranges specified by assuming 30 uncertainty around parameters point estimates the model was then refitted to the input data and the resulting distributions of estimates across all 500 runs were used to calculate the model predictions means and 95 uncertainty intervals uis the model fitted the different covid-19 empirical data such as time-series of diagnosed cases  figure 1a  time-series of reported deaths  figure 1b  and age-stratified attack rate as of between actual death and reported death figure 2 shows the predicted time evolution of covid-19 crude case fatality rate cfr in the early phase of the epidemic the crude cfr increased rapidly following the rise in incidence but plateaued shortly after towards the end of the first month and remained so till incidence reached its peak when incidence started declining 90 days the crude cfr grew rapidly eventually saturating at 150 days the true that is final cfr in the total population estimated through the 500 simulation runs was 51 95 ui48-54 figure s2a of si figure 4 illustrates the predicted degree of assortativeness in the age group mixing across the 500 simulation runs which was estimated at 0004 95 ui0002-0008-there was virtually no assortativeness in infection transmission mixing by age figure 5 and figure s2c of si show the time evolution of 0 r  and its predicted mean and 95 ui across the 500 uncertainty runs respectively in the early phase of the epidemic 0 r was estimated at 21 95 ui 18-24 but rapidly declined to 006 95 ui 005-007 following the onset of interventions the sharp transition duration for 0 r was estimated at 115 days 95 ui 95-130 several key attributes of the epidemiology of covid-19 have been investigated and estimated a finding is that the biological susceptibility to the infection appears to vary by age  figure 3  susceptibility to covid-19 was substantially higher among those 50 years of age compared to those in the younger age groups for instance compared to those 60-69 years of age those 19 years of age 20-29 years of age and 30-39 years of age were respectively 94 68 and 43 less susceptible to being infected notably this age-dependence in the susceptibility to the infection could not be explained by differences in mixing between age groups as the results indicated limited assortativeness in infection transmission mixing by age  figure 4  these findings support an important role for age in the epidemiology of this infection and affirm other studies suggesting lower susceptibility to the infection at younger age 22 23  remarkably the observed attack rate pattern for covid-19 by age  figure 1c  is the inverse or better complement of the age-specific cumulative incidence pattern of the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic h1n1pdm infection  figure s3 of si 24  this may suggest that a potential protective factor against covid-19 acquisition or rapid clearance at young age could be prior recent exposure cross immunity to other viruses particularly other cold coronaviruses 25  an alternative hypothesis has suggested immune imprinting to a similar virus among adults 22  this being said the underlying immunological andor epidemiological factors driving this age effect remain to be investigated with several alternative mechanisms potentially explaining this pattern for instance children and young adults may have subclinical infection with low viral load and rapid clearance with limited transmission potential to others of note that the contact tracing data from china suggest that children do not appear to play a significant role in the transmission 3 26 27  the study predicted that the cfr will reach about 5 by the end of the outbreak in china  figure 2  that is by the time all currently active cases would have been resolved either through recovery or death our results indicated that the crude cfr observed in the first three months of the outbreak underestimated the true cfr by about 50 this is because most infections were still recent infections and have not yet progressed to critical disease or death-death is a late outcome that was estimated to occur 2-8 weeks after onset of symptoms 3  another finding of this study is the limited assortativeness in infection transmission mixing by age  figure 4  that is equal mixing between the different age groups this finding is possibly explained by the fact that most transmissions occurred in the context of households rather than of schools or workplaces as supported by existing evidence 3  indeed analysis of 344 clusters in guangdong and sichuan provinces indicated that 78-85 of clusters pertained to families 3  this finding is also supported by analysis of the contacts stratified by age in china 23  it is however important to highlight that while this finding may apply to the hubei outbreak given the lockdown measures that may have limited all other transmission pathways it may not necessarily be generalizable to other settings the present study affirmed the impact and success of the drastic preventive measures in curtailing infection transmission 0 r was sharply reduced by 97 over a short duration  figure   5  at the beginning of the epidemic on average each infected person had 06 infectious contacts per day that is each person passed the infection to 06 persons per day  figure s2d of si the rate of infectious contacts can be expressed roughly as c p   where c is the number of social contacts conducive to covid-19 transmission per day and p is the transmission probability of the virus in a single contact while p is unknown it is possibly in the order of 1-5 as suggested by contact tracing data from china-1-5 of contacts were subsequently laboratoryconfirmed as covid-19 cases 3  this implies that on average each infected person had somewhere between 10-60 contacts per day at the beginning of the epidemic but very few contacts after the lockdown the latter further affirms the role of the lockdown in severely cutting the contact rate making sustainable infection transmission very difficult this study has limitations model projections are contingent on the quality and representativeness of the input data for instance we assumed infection levels to be as officially documented but evidence suggested that many infections may have been undocumented particularly in the early phase of the outbreak 12  the natural history of this infection is not yet firmly established and the case management protocols have evolved over time 19 20  mortality data seem to suggest that the standard of care improved over time especially in recent weeks when the healthcare sector was no longer overwhelmed with a large case load we  age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the patterns of covid-19 transmission dynamics in china the biological susceptibility to the infection seems limited among children intermediate among young adults and those mid-age but high among those 50 years of age there was no evidence for considerable differential contact mixing by age consistent with most transmission occurring in households rather than in schools or workplaces  all data are within the paper and its supplementary information we declare no competing interests  the model was expressed in terms of a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations for each age group the index a denotes the different age cohorts   1 29 a  in the population with each age group representing a ten-year age band apart from the last one those 80 years of age the population size and demographic structure were set by chinas demography as provided by the united nations world population prospects database 1  however the population size and distribution across age groups were fixed at 2020 levels to disentangle the epidemiologic and demographic effects-a valid assumption given that the current time scale of the epidemic is only few months all covid-19 mortality was assumed to occur in individuals that are in the critical disease stage as informed by the china outbreak data 2  the following set of equations was used to describe the epidemic dynamics in the first age group population aged 0-9 years  the definitions of population variables and symbols used in the equations are listed in table s1  table s1  definitions of population variables and symbols used in the model  here   t  is the rate of infectious contacts parameterized to capture the effect of the public health interventions implemented in china through a woods-saxon function 3 4 5 6  this function is mathematically designed to describe and characterize transitions in terms of their scale or strength smoothness or abruptness thickness duration and the turning point 3 4  age e   the mixing is fully assortative that is individuals mix only with members in their own age group the disease mortality rate   a  was parametrized through an overall fitting factor multiplied by the observed crude age-stratified case fatality rate the input parameters of the model were chosen based on current empirical data for covid-19 natural history and epidemiology the parameter values are listed in table s2   there was a change in coronavirus case definition in china on february 13 2020 to include in addition to the laboratory-confirmed cases those who are clinically-diagnosed 15 16  this led to a very sharp one-day increase in the reported numbers of infections and deaths respectively 17 these outlying observations included the excess cases not accounted for in previous days to correct for this data artifact we distributed the number of cases reported on february 13 2020 over a time duration including this date and previous dates this was done through the condition figure s3  age-specific cumulative incidence of the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic h1n1pdm virus 18   clinical epidemiological analyses of overweightobesity and abnormal liver function contributing to prolonged hospitalization in patients infected with covid-19 xiang hu xiaoqiong pan wei zhou xuejiang gu feixia shen bo yang zhen hu   since coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged at the end of 2019 it rapidly became a global pandemic involving nearly 3 million individuals infected 1 as a global threat to human health the outbreak of covid-19 is bringing public health to the forefront as the american covid-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network reported obesity is one of the most common underlying conditions in patients hospitalized with covid-19 2 by analogy to h1n1 infection which obesity predisposed to its severe pulmonary form 3 obesity might play a critical role in covid-19 transmission and deterioration recently clinical researchers discovered that for covid-19 obesity was associated with hospital admission severity intensive medical intervention and mortality 46 given the evidence supporting that obesity increases the duration of virus shedding of influenza a 7 the influence of obesity on the disease course and recovery of covid-19 which remained to be unclear is of importance to investigate the main clinical symptoms of patients with covid-19 are nonspecific similar to other viral infections targeting the respiratory system included fever dry cough weakness and breathing difficulty 8 clinical evidence marked the presence of extra-pulmonary manifestations of covid-19 like digestive symptoms diarrhea nausea and vomiting 9 notably abnormal liver function alf has been reported in 161763 of patients with covid-19 10 liver damage in patients with coronavirus infections might be directly caused by the viral infection of liver cells previously liver damage has been reported as an important risk factor for severe outcome and death in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 11 similarly recent clinical studies have reported that severity of covid-19 was associated with the incidence of liver injury 12 suggesting clinically significant liver dysfunction an important characteristic of coronavirus infections may be able to predict the prognosis of covid-19 however there are limited studies exploring the effect of existing liver-related comorbidities on the disease course and recovery of covid-19 12 according to the report from the chinese center for disease control and prevention 81 of confirmed cases were classified as mild in spectrum of covid-19 13 the disease course and recovery of this part of patients determined the health and economic burden covid-19 caused which could be reflected by the hospitalized duration to some extent therefore enrolling patients with mild disease of covid-19 the present study conducted a clinical epidemiological analysis to investigate the association of overweightobesity and alf with hospitalized duration to provide clinical evidence for prevention and treatment of covid-19 the present single-centered retrospective study was conducted in the second affiliated hospital and yuying childrens hospital of wenzhou medical university data were derived from 58 confirmed patients who were admitted to the hospital between february 5 2020 and february 20 2020 six patients of them lack the data of height all of the patients were diagnosed as mild covid-19 according to the standards for diagnosis and treatment scheme of new coronavirus infected pneumonia trial version 6 14 the criteria of hospital discharge were as followings 1 body temperature was kept normal for more than 3 consecutive days 2 significant reduction of respiratory symptoms 3 substantial improvement determined by conventional chest radiography detection 4 at least two consecutively negative results of rt-pcr testing separated by an interval of 24 h prolonged hospitalization was defined as lasting more than the median value of the hospitalized days 19 days in this population discharging from hospital in time as 19 days this study was approved by the institutional review board of the second affiliated hospital and yuying childrens hospital of wenzhou medical university due to the retrospective nature of the study informed consent was waived every patient underwent a physical examination after admission which included anthropometric measurements body height and weight and blood pressure bp body height and weight were used to calculate body mass index bmi as follows bmi  weight kgheight2 m2 systolic bp sbp and diastolic bp dbp were assessed with a mercury sphygmomanometer in triplicate with a 3-min interval after 10 min of rest overweightobesity were defined as bmi  24 kgm2 15 laboratory measurements were performed standardly venous blood samples were harvested from all confirmed patients after an overnight fast all laboratory data were obtained from the first serum collection during hospitalization the peripheral absolute value of white blood cell including neutrophils monocytes and lymphocyte fasting plasma glucose fpg alanine aminotransferase alt albumin alb serum creatinine scr blood urea nitrogen bun and c-reactive protein crp were measured using standard methods the present study defined alf as alt more than the upper limit of normal value 40 ul the statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package version 160 spss inc chicago il usa the normality of data distribution was accessed by the one-sample kolmogorovsmirnov test continuous variables were expressed as mean  standard deviation or median with interquartile range according to normal or skewed distribution intergroup comparisons of normally and skewed distributed data were carried out by the unpaired students t test and mannwhitney u test respectively the chi-square test was used for intergroup comparisons of categorical variables kaplanmeier curves reflected and compared the hospitalized duration and possibility to be discharged from hospital in time between different groups cox regression analysis identified the independent factors associated with being discharged from hospital in time all reported p values were two-tailed and p  005 was considered statistically significant a total of 58 participants with an average age of 492  131 years age range 2077 years were enrolled in present study including 36 men 621 and 22 women 379 compared with men women showed lower levels of peripheral absolute value of monocytes and scr as well as a shorter hospitalized duration all p  005 there was no gender difference in other variables table 1 based on bmi and alt patients were divided into those with or without overweightobesity and those with or without alf twenty-nine 558 patients were overweightobesity and 17293 patients had alf compared with those without overweightobesity patients with overweightobesity exhibits longer hospitalized duration 174  61 versus 204

patients with neither overweightobesity nor alf to those with either overweightobesity or alf and to those with both of overweightobesity and alf mean with 95 ci 164 145183 versus 253 216291 versus

present study discovered that overweightobesity and alf predisposed patients with covid-19 to prolonged hospitalization bmi and alt were independently and inversely associated with being discharged from hospital in time for these patients based on the data from a large academic hospital system in new york city american researchers found that in young and middle-aged patients with covid-19 obesity appeared to be a potential risk factor for hospital admission and need for acute or critical care 4 a retrospective cohort study conducted in a single french center revealed that the frequency of obesity was relatively high in patients with severe degree of covid-19 presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation was associated with severe obesity the disease was more severe with an increase in bmi reaching maximal in patients with severe obesity 5 a spanish study also reported that among patients with covid-19 admitted to intensive care unit icu obesity was the most common comorbidities 16 however there is absence of data about the association of obesity and the disease course of covid-19 in chinese population which might attribute to the lower prevalence of obesity in china than that in american and european regions 17 in addition the existing studies above were more concerned on the patients with obesity and severe degree of covid-19 in consideration of the rapid increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide which doubled since 1980 to an extent that nearly one third of the global population is classified to be overweight or obese now 17 the role of overweightobesity in the covid-19 epidemic must not be ignored in patients with mild degree of covid-19 who were the majority of infected population consistent with the previous findings in american and european patients the present study uncovered that patients with overweightobesity were more likely to be hospitalized longer and lower level of bmi contributed to being discharged from hospital in time alf has been observed in some published studies chinese researchers analyzed clinical characteristics of covid-19 among the 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities in mainland china and found elevated levels of alt in 120 198 of patients with non-severe disease and 38 281 of 135 patients with severe disease furthermore more patients with elevated alt reached the primary composite end point including admission to an icu the use of mechanical ventilation or death 18 later a study from south of china also reported a high prevalence of alf 763 in patients with covid-19 and alf became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks patients with alf had higher risk to progress to severe disease 10 nevertheless a study conducted in 52 critically ill adult patients did not find difference in the incidences of alf between survivors 30 and non-survivors 28 19 focusing on patients with mild disease the present study revealed that alf was associated with prolonged hospitalization and alt was a negative factor associated with being discharged from hospital in time because the patients with mild disease are the majority of the patients with covid-19 13 the disease course and recovery of this part of patients determined the health and economic burden and the recovery of public health system and development of society patients were allowed to be discharge from hospital only when they were confirmed to be not contagious 14 hence the hospitalized duration could reflect not only disease course and recovery but also the transmission of covid-19 to some extent therefore the present study findings suggested that the increasing fat accumulation even not reaching the extent of obesity and liver dysfunction might be involved in disease course especially recovery and transmission of covid-19 the underlying mechanism of the association of covid-19 with overweightobesity and alf was unclear with high affinity for covid-19 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which was supposed to mediate the entry of covid-19 into host cells 20 might be one of the common explanations the expression of ace2 is enriched in adipocyte 21 and cholangiocytes 22 with large amounts of ace2-expressing cells people with overweightobesity will be more vulnerable to covid-19 and more of its pathogen and thus they might be easy to spread the disease and hard to recover in addition the virus might be able to directly bind to ace2-positive cholangiocytes inducing systemic inflammation and finally leading to alf 22 the present study has some limitations first this study was retrospective and some cases had incomplete documentation for the history of present illness and the clinical data second the present study did not take into consideration the medical intervention the influence of medicine on alf third lack of the data of other indicators of liver function such as aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase the prevalence of alf might be underestimated forth as patients of this study were from a southeastern city in china these findings cannot be generalized to other regions of varying epidemiological characteristics in conclusion overweightobesity and liver dysfunction contributed to prolonged hospitalization with high risk of covid-19 individuals with overweightobesity and existing liver diseases required close monitoring and prevention and for patients with covid-19 even when the disease is mild extra attentions and precautions should be paid for those with overweightobesity and alf during clinical treatments  recovery a multimodal repository for covid-19 news credibility research xinyi zhou emilio ferrara reza zafarani   as of june 4 th  the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in over 64 million confirmed cases and over 380000 deaths globally 1 governments have enforced border shutdowns travel restrictions and quarantines to flatten the curve 2  the covid-19 outbreak has had a detrimental impact on not only the healthcare sector but also every aspect of human life such as education and economic sectors 10  for example over 100 countries have imposed nationwide even complete closures of education facilities which has lead to over 900 million learners being affected 2 statistics indicate that 33 million americans applied for unemployment benefits in the week ending on march 21 th and the number doubled in the following week before which time the highest number of unemployment applications ever received in one week was 695000 in 1982 7 along with the covid-19 pandemic we are also experiencing an infodemic of information with low credibility regarding covid-19 3 hundreds of news websites have contributed to publishing false coronavirus information 4 individuals who believe false news articles claiming that for example eating boiled garlic or drinking chlorine dioxide an industrial bleach can cure or prevent coronavirus might take an ineffective or extremely dangerous action to protect themselves from the virus 5 given this background research is motivated to combat this infodemic hence we design and construct a multimodal repository recovery to facilitate reliability assessment of news on covid-19 we first broadly search and investigate 2000 news publishers as past literature has indicated there is a close relationship between the credibility of news articles and their publication sources 22 in total 2029 news articles on coronavirus are finally collected in the repository along with 140820 tweets that reveal how these news articles are spread on the social network the main contributions of this work are summarized as follows first we construct a repository to support the research that investigates 1 how news with low credibility is created and spreads in this covid-19 pandemic and 2 ways to predict such fake news the manner in which the ground truth of news credibility is obtained allows a scalable repository as annotators need not label each news article that is time-consuming and instead they can directly label the news site second recovery provides multimodal information on covid-19 news articles basically for each news article we collect its news content and social context information revealing how it spreads on social media which covers textual visual temporal and network information third we conduct extensive experiments using recovery which includes analyzing our data data statistics and distributions and providing baseline performances for predicting news credibility using recovery data these baselines allow future methods to be easily compared to baselines are obtained using either news content alone or combined with social context information within a framework of supervised machine learning the rest of this paper is organized as follows we first detail how the data is collected in section 2 the statistics and distributions of the data are presented and analyzed in section 3 experiments that use the data to predict news credibility are designed and conducted in section 4 whose results can be used as benchmarks finally we review the related dataset in section 5 and conclude in section 6 the overall process that we collect the data including news content and social media information is presented in figure 1  to facilitate scalability news credibility is assessed based on the credibility of the media site that publishes the news article based on the process outlined in figure 1  we will further detail how the data is collected answering the following three questions 1 how to identify reliable or unreliable news sites mainly releasing real news or fake news which we address in section 21 having determined such news sites 2 how do we crawl covid-19 news articles from these sites and what news components are valuable for collection section 22 and given covid-19 news articles 3 how can we track their spread on social networks section 23 to determine a list of reliable and unreliable news sites we primarily rely on two resources newsguard and media biasfact check newsguard 6 newsguard is developed to review and rate news websites its reliability rating team is formed by trained journalists and experienced editors whose credentials and backgrounds are all transparent and

levels based on the fact-checking results of the news articles it has published more details can be found on its methodology page i very high ii high iii most factual iv mixed v low and vi very low such information has been used as ground truth for automatic fact-checking studies 1 what are our criteria referenced by newsguard and mbfc our criteria for determining reliable and unreliable news sites are  reliable a news site is reliable if its newsguard score is greater than 90 and its factual reporting on mbfc is very high or high  unreliable a news site is unreliable if its newsguard score is less than 30 and its factual reporting on mbfc is below mixed our search towards news medium with high credibility is conducted among news articles listed in mbfc 2000 to find news medium with low credibility we search in mbfc and the newly released coronavirus misinformation tracking center 5 of news-guard which provides a list of websites publishing false coronavirus information ultimately we obtain a total of 61 news sites from which 22 are the sources of reliable news articles eg national public radio 8 and reuters 9  and the remaining 39 are sources to collect unreliable news articles eg human are free 10 and natural news 11  the full list of sites considered in our repository is also available at httpcoronavirus-fakenewscom note that several fake news medium are not included such as 70 news conservative 101 and denver guardian since they no longer exist or their domains have been unavailable also note that to achieve a good trade-off between dataset scalability and label accuracy we determine more extreme threshold a reliable news 12 b unreliable news 13 figure 3  examples of news articles collected scores 30 and 90 compared to the initial one provided by news-guard 60 in this way the selected news sites share an extreme reliability or unreliability to reduce the number of the false positive and false negative of news labels in our repository ideally each news article published on a reliable site is factual and on an unreliable site is false figure 2 illustrates the credibility distributions of reliable and unreliable news sites it can be observed from the figure that for reliable news most of them get a full mark on newsguard and are labeled as highly factual by mbfc very high is rare for all sites listed in mbfc in contrast unreliable news sites share an average newsguard score of 15 and a low factual label by mbfc similarly very low is rarely given on mbfc to crawl covid-19 news articles from selected news sites we first determine whether the news article is about covid-19 the process is detailed in section 221 next we detail how the data is crawled and the news content components that are included in our repository in section 222 to identify news articles on covid-19 we use a list of keywords  covid-19 and  coronavirus news articles whose content contains any of the keywords caseinsensitive are considered related to covid-19 these three keywords are the official names announced by the who on february 11 th  where sars-cov-2 standing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the virus name and coronavirus and covid-19 are the name of the disease that the virus causes before the who announcement covid-19 was previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus  14  which also includes the coronavirus keyword which we are considering we merely consider official names as keywords to avoid potential biases or even discrimination in articles collected furthermore a news media article that is credible or pretends to be credible often acts professionally and adopts the official names of the diseasevirus compared to those articles that use biased andor inaccurate terms false news pretending to be professional is more detrimental and challenging to detect which has become the focus of current fake news studies 22 examples of such news articles are illustrated in figure 3  python library 15 the content of each news article corresponds to twelve components c1 news id each news article is assigned a unique id as the identity c2 news url the url of the news article the url helps us verify the correctness of the collected data it can also be used as the reference and source when repository users would like to extend the repository by fetching additional information c3 publisher the name of the news media site that publishes the news article c4 publication date the date in yyyy-mm-dd format on which the news article was published on the site which provides temporal information to support the investigation of eg the relationship between the misinformation volume and the outbreak of covid-19 over time c5 author the authors of the news article whose number can be none one or more than one note that some news articles might have fictional author names author information is valuable in evaluating news credibility by either investigating the collaboration network of authors 14 or exploring its relationships with news publishers and content 20  c6-7 news title and bodytext as the main textual information c8 news image as the main visual information which is provided in the form of a link url note that most images within the news page are noise -they can be advertisements images belonging to other news articles due to the recommender systems embedded in news sites logos of news sites andor social media icons such as twitter and facebook logos for sharing hence we particularly fetch the mainheadtop image for each news article to reduce noise c9 country the name of country where the news is published c10 political bias each news article is labeled as one of extreme left left left-center center right-center right and extreme right that is equivalent to the political bias of its publisher news political bias is verified by two resources allsides 16 and mfbc both which rely on domain experts to label media bias and c11-12 newsguard score and mbfc factual reporting as the original ground truth of news credibility which has been detailed in section 21 we first use twitter search api 17  the general statistics on our dataset is presented in table 1  the dataset contains 2029 news articles most of which have both textual and visual information for multimodal studies 2017 18 21 and have shared on social media 1747 the proportion of reliable versus unreliable news articles is around 21 hence due to class imbalance compared to accuracy rate auc or f 1 scores should be a better evaluation metric when using the collected data to predict news credibility note that the number of users who spread reliable news 78659 pluses that of users spreading unreliable news 17 323 is greater than the total number of users including in the dataset 93761 which indicates that users can both engage in spreading reliable and unreliable news articles next we visualize the distributions of data featuresattributes distribution of news publishers figure 4 shows the number of covid-19 news articles published in each extremely reliable or extremely unreliable news site there are six unreliable publishers with no news on covid-19 hence they are not presented in the figure we keep these publishers in our repository as the data will be updated over time and these publishers may publish news articles on covid-19 in the future news publication dates the distribution of news publication dates is presented in figure 5  where all articles are published in 2020 we point out that from january to may the number of covid-19 news articles published is significantly exponentially increased the possible explanation for this phenomena is three-fold first from the time that the outbreak was first identified in wuhan china december 2019 8 to may 2020 the number of confirmed cases and deaths caused by sars-cov-2 have grown exponentially globally 1 meanwhile the virus has become a world topic and has triggered more and more discussions on a world-wide scale second some older news articles are no longer available which has motivated us to timely update the dataset third the keywords we have used to identify covid-19 news articles are the official ones a b c n ew s b us in es s in si de r c b s n ew s c n b c c hi ca go s un -t im es f iv et hi rt ye ig ht lo s a ng el es d ai ly n ew s n at io na l p ub lic r ad io n

os t u s a to da y w as hi ng to n m on th ly 19 some news articles published in january are also collected as before the who announcement covid-19 was known as the 2019 novel coronavirus  which also includes one of our keywords coronavirus  we have detailed the reasons behind our keyword selection in section 221 news authors and author collaborations figure 6 presents the distribution of the number of authors contributing to news articles which is governed by a long-tail distribution most articles have less than five authors instead of including the real or virtual names of the authors some articles provide publisher names as authors considering such information has been available in the repository we leave the author information of these news articles blank ie their number of authors is zero furthermore we construct the coauthorship network shown in figure 7  it can be observed from the network that node degrees also follow a power-law-like distribution among 1095 nodes authors over 90 of them have less than or equal to two collaborators figures 8 and 9 reveal textual characteristics within news content including news title and bodytext it can be observed from figures 8 that the number of words within news content follows a long-tail power-low-like distribution with an average value of 800 and a median value of 600 on the other hand figure 9 provides the word cloud for the entire repository as the news articles collected share the same covid-19 topic some relevant topics and vocabularies have been naturally and frequently used by the news authors such as coronavirus 6465 covid 5413 state 4432 test 4274 health 3714 pandemic 3427 virus 2903 home 2871 case 2676 and trump 2431 that are illustrated with word font size scaled to their frequencies country distribution figure 10 reveals the countries that news and news publishers belong to it can be observed that in total six countries usa russia uk iran cyprus and canada are covered where us news and news publishers constitute the majority of the population figure 11 is the distribution of political bias of news and news medium publishers it can be observed from the figure that for both news and publishers the distribution for those exhibiting a right bias including extreme right right and right-center is more balanced compared to those exhibiting a left bias including extreme left left and left-center news spreading frequencies figure 12 shows the distribution of the number of tweets spreading each news article the distribution exhibits a long tail -over 80 of news articles are spread less than 100 times while a few have been shared by thousands of tweets news spreaders the distribution of the number of spreaders for each news article is shown in figure 13  it differs from the distribution in figure 12 as one user can spread a news article multiple times as for social connections of news spreaders the distributions of their followers and friends are respectively presented in figures  14 and 15  where the most popular spreader has over 40 million followers or 600000 friends in this section several methods that often act as baselines are utilized and developed to predict covid-19 news credibility using recovery data hoping to facilitate future studies these methods baselines are first specified in section 41 the implementation details of experiments are then provided in section 42 finally we present the performance results for these methods in section 43 broadly speaking all developed methods fall under a traditional supervised machine learning framework where features are manually engineered to represent news articles see section 411 and then classified by a well-trained classifier such as a random forest classifier see section 412 we design and extract the following three feature groups in our experiments liwc features liwc is a widely-accepted psycholinguistic lexicon given a news story liwc can count the words in the text falling into one or more of 93 linguistic eg self-references psychological eg anger and topical eg leisure categories 12  based on which 93 features are extracted here we consider in a total of eight features for each news article 1 the timestamp at which the news was published 2 the number of news authors 3 4 the mean and median number of collaborators of the news authors 5-7 the number of words in news title bodytext and the entire content and 8 the number of news images compared to liwc features that merely focus on news textual information title and bodytext this group of features comprehensively investigates most of the components of news content that are included in the repository social attributes six features are extracted from the available social attributes of each news article in the repository 1 the frequency of the news being spread ie the number of corresponding tweets 2 the number of news spreaders 3-6 the mean and median number of followers or friends of news spreaders in current fake news research often a random classifier is used as one of the baselines 22  which randomly labels a news article as reliable or unreliable with equal probability we further use multiple common supervised learners classifiers in our experiments logistic regression lr nave bayes nb k-nearest neighbor k-nn random forest rf decision tree dt support vector machines svm and xgboost xgb 4  the overall dataset is randomly divided into training and testing datasets with a proportion of 8020 as the dataset has an unbalanced distribution between reliable and unreliable news articles 21 we evaluate the prediction results in terms of precision recall and the f 1 score each performance outcome is obtained by averaging five experimental results repeated with different random seeds on the dataset division all classifiers are trained with default hyperparameters prediction results are presented in table 2  it can be observed from the table that when predicting news credibility using news content alone attribute features are more representative compared to liwc features attribute features can perform best with an f 1 score of 0772 with a random forest classifier and liwc features perform best with an f 1 score of 0708 using xgboost furthermore using both news content and social information to predict news credibility can further improve the performance achieving an f 1 score of 08 related datasets can be generally grouped as i covid-19 datasets and ii fake news and rumor datasets covid-19 datasets as a global emergency 15  the outbreak of covid-19 has been labelled as a black swan event and likened to the economic scene of world war ii 10  with this background a group of datasets have emerged whose contributions range from real-time tracking of covid-19 to help epidemiological forecasting eg 5 and 19  and collecting scholarly covid-19 articles for literaturebased discoveries eg  to tracking the spreading of covid-19 information on twitter eg 3  20 httpswwwsemanticscholarorgcord19 specifically researchers at johns hopkins university jhu develop a web-based dashboard 21 to visualize and track reported cases of covid-19 in real-time the dashboard is released on january 22 nd  presenting the location and number of confirmed covid-19 cases deaths and recoveries for all affected countries 5  another dataset shared publicly on march 24 th is constructed to aid the analysis and tracking of the covid-19 epidemic which provides real-time individual-level data eg symptoms date of onset admission and confirmation and travel history from national provincial and municipal health reports 19  intended to mobilize researchers to apply recent advances in natural language processing nlp to generate new insights in support of the fight against covid-19 allen institute for ai has contributed a free and dynamic database of more than 128000 scholarly articles about covid-19 named cord-19 to the global research community 20 on the other hand chen et al 3 release the first large-scale covid-19 twitter dataset the dataset updated regularly collects covid-19 tweets that are posted from january 21 st and across languages fake news and rumor datasets existing fake news and rumor datasets are collected with various focuses these datasets may i only contain news content that can be full articles eg nela-gt-2018 11  or short claims eg fever 16  ii only contain social media information eg credbank 9  where news refers to user posts or iii contain both content and social media information eg liar 17 and fakenewsnet 13  specifically nela-gt-2018 11 is a large-scale dataset of around 713000 news articles from february to november 2018 news articles are collected from 194 news medium with multiple labels directly obtained from newsguard pew research center wikipedia opensources mbfc allsides buzzfeed news and politifact these labels refer to news credibility transparency political polarizations and authenticity fever dataset 16 consists of 185000 claims and is constructed following two steps claim generation and annotation first the authors extract sentences from wikipedia and then the annotators manually generate a set of claims based on the extracted sentences then the annotators label each claim as supported refuted or not enough information by comparing it with the original sentence from which it is developed on the other hand some datasets focus on user posts on social media for example credbank 9 comprises more than 60 million tweets grouped into 1049 real-world events each of which is annotated by 30 human annotators while some contain both news content and social media information for instance collecting both claims and fact-check results labels ie true mostly true halftrue mostly false and pants on fire directly from politifact wang establishes the liar dataset 17 containing around 12800 verified statements made in public speeches and social medium the aforementioned datasets only contain textual information valuable for nlp research with limited information on how fake news and rumors spread on social networks which motivate the construction of fakenewsnet dataset 13 the dataset collects verified real or fake full news articles from politifact 1056 and gossipcop 22140 respectively the dataset also tracks news spreading on twitter to fight the coronavirus infodemic we construct a multimodal repository for covid-19 news credibility research which provides textual visual temporal and network information regarding news content and how news spreads on social media the repository balances data scalability and label accuracy to facilitate future studies benchmarks are developed and their performances on predicting news credibility using the data available in the repository are presented we find that using news content andor social attributes available in the repository we can achieve an f 1 score of 077 when news has not yet spread on social media ie only news content is available and an f 1 score of 081 can be achieved when it has been shared by social media users we point out that the data could be further enhanced 1 by including covid-19 news articles in various languages such as chinese russian spanish and italian as well as the information on how these news articles spread on the popular local social media for those languages eg sina weibo china countries speaking but not limited to these languages have all been suffering heavy losses in this pandemic and have shown different characteristics in their spreading in the physical world 22  which would be invaluable when investigating the relationship between the spread of the virus in the physical world and that of its related misinformation on social networks furthermore 2

sven saussez   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an ongoing viral pandemic that emerged from east asia and quickly spread to the rest of the world 1 this infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and is so far responsible for more than 15000 deaths worldwide 2 human-to-human transmission is characterized by a troubling exponential rate which has led to steep curves of onset in many areas 3 according to the clinical studies from asia the most prevalent symptoms consist of fever cough dyspnea sputum production myalgia arthralgia headache diarrhea rhinorrhea and sore throat 4 5 the spread of the covid-19 infection in europe has highlighted a new atypical presentation of the disease patients with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions the occurrence of smell dysfunction in viral infections is not new in otolaryngology many viruses may lead to olfactory dysfunction od through an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa and the development of rhinorrhea the most familiar agents being rhinovirus parainfluenza epsteinbarr virus and some coronavirus 6 7 however olfactory dysfunction linked to covid-19 infection seems particular as it is not associated with rhinorrhea over the past few weeks some european otolaryngologists observed that many patients infected by sars-cov-2 presented with severe olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions without rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction at baseline no covid-19 was suspected in some of these patients because they had no fever cough or other systemic complaints faced with numerous reports from otolaryngologists all around europe the young-otolaryngologists of the international federation of oto-rhino-laryngological societies yo-ifos decided to conduct an international epidemiological study to characterize olfactory and gustatory disorders in infected patients the aim of this study is to investigate and characterize the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory disorders in patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection the clinical data of patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection have been collected from four belgian hospitals chu saint-pierre brussels chu ambroise par mons epicura baudour epicura ath and university of mons belgium in addition to these ones many other patients infected physicians and nurses have been voluntarily enrolled in the study from the following hospitals foch hospital paris france ambroise par hospital ap-hp paris chu ambroise par mons belgium hospital universitario donostia donostia spain hospital universitario santiago de compostela santiago de compostela spain morgagni pierantoni hospital forli italy department of neuroscience audiology unit padova university treviso italy and medical departments of the universit degli studi della campania luigi vanvitelli naples italy the following inclusion criteria have been considered adult  18 years old laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr native speaker patients and patients clinically able to fulfill the questionnaire the following exclusion criteria have been considered patients with olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions before the epidemic patients without a laboratory-confirmed covid-19 infection diagnosis patients who were in the intensive-care unit at the time of the study due to their health status thus we mainly included mild-to-moderate covid-19 patients defined as patients without need of intensive cares since we focused on the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory disorders clinical presentation was not considered in as inclusion criteria clinical data have been prospectively collected during the ear nose and throat ent consultation in the patients room or over the phone for house-bound patients or infected health professionals the data were also collected through an online form for house-bound patients the online questionnaire was created with professional survey monkey san mateo ca usa so that each participant could complete the survey only once the selection of the relevant epidemiological and clinical features composing the questionnaire was carried out by the covid-19 task force of yo-ifos which includes otolaryngologists from north america europe and asia 8 experts analyzed the epidemiological publications of the current and the previous coronavirus infections including sras-cov-1 2002 middle-east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus infection mers-cov 2012 and the covid-19 infection from the literature ten experts jrl ss mh jhs pl ta ld fea cch and cmce developed the questionnaire which consisted of four general questions age sex ethnicity and date of diagnosis three general clinical questions comorbidities general and ent symptoms associated with covid-19 infection seven questions about olfactory function four questions investigating gustatory function and one question about the treatment of the covid-19 infection all patients were asked to complete the short version of the questionnaire of olfactory disorders-negative statements sqod-ns 9 the questionnaire has been translated into spanish italian and english by two native speaker otolaryngologists for each language the occurrence of anosmia or hyposmia has been identified in the questionnaire the impact of olfactory dysfunction on the quality of life qol of patients has been assessed through the validated sqod-ns appendix 1 9 this is a seven-item patient-reported outcome questionnaire including social eating annoyance and anxiety questions each item is rated on a scale of 03 with higher scores reflecting better olfactory-specific qol the total score ranges from 0 severe impact on qol to 21 no impact on qol 9 the rest of the olfactory and gustatory questions were based on the smell and taste component of the national health and nutrition examination survey 10 this population survey was implemented by the centers for disease control and prevention to continuously monitor the health of adult citizens in the united states through a nationally representative sample of 5000 persons yearly 10 the questions have been chosen to characterize the variation timing and associated symptoms of both olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions and therefore they suggest a potential etiology note that we assessed the mean recovery time of olfaction through four defined propositions 14 days 58 days 914 days and  15 days referring to the studies that have demonstrated that the viral load was significantly decreased after 14 days 11 we assessed the short-term olfaction non-recovery rate on patients exhibiting double criteria an onset of the infection  14 days before the assessment and the lack of general symptoms at the time of the evaluation statistical package for the social sciences for windows spss version 220 ibm corp armonk ny usa was used to perform the statistical analyses the potential associations between epidemiological clinical and olfactory and gustatory outcomes have been assessed through cross-tab generation between two variables binary or categorical variables and chi-square test incomplete responses were excluded from analysis the differences in sqod-ns scores between patients regarding the olfactory dysfunction were made through the kruskalwallis test a level of p  005 was used to determine statistical significance the general symptoms of patients during the infection are described in fig 2 cough myalgia loss of appetite diarrhea fever headache and asthenia were the most prevalent symptoms accounting for more than 45 of patients the otolaryngological symptoms most related to the infection are reported in table 2 a total of 357 patients 856 had olfactory dysfunction related to the infection among them 284 796 patients were anosmic and 73 204 were hyposmic phantosmia and parosmia concerned 126 and 324 of patients during the disease course respectively the olfactory dysfunction appeared before 118 after 654 or at the same time as the appearance of general or ent symptoms 228 note that 94 of patients did not remember the time of onset of olfactory dysfunction and therefore were not considered for the percentage evaluation considering the 247 patients with a clinically resolved infection absence of general and ent symptoms the olfactory dysfunction persisted after the resolution of other symptoms in 630 of cases the mean time between the onset of the disease and the assessment of this group of patients was 977  568 days the short-term olfaction recovery rate which was assessed in 59 clinically cured patients was 440 the different recovery times of the olfactory function of patients who reported a recovery of the olfactory function are available in fig 3 in total 726 of these patients recovered olfactory function within the first 8 days following the resolution of the disease among the patients who reported anosmia then excluding hyposmic patients the olfactory function recovered throughout the 8 first days following the resolution of the disease in 678 of cases fig 3 in the present study 76 patients did not suffer from nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea 182 among them 203 did not report olfactory dysfunction whereas 662 and 135 suffered from anosmia and hyposmia respectively the impact of olfactory dysfunction on patient qol is reported in table 3 anosmic patients at the time of the evaluation had a significant lower sqod-ns score compared with hyposmic and normosmic individuals p  0001 kruskalwallis a total of 342 patients 888 reported gustatory disorders which was characterized by impairment of the following four taste modalities salty sweet bitter and sour note that 32 patients did not remember if they had gustatory dysfunction and therefore they were not considered for the assessment of the gustatory disorder prevalence the gustatory dysfunction consisted of reduceddiscontinued or distorted ability to taste flavors in 789 and 211 of patients respectively among the 43 patients without gustatory dysfunction 19 442 have no olfactory dysfunction whereas 16 372 and 4 93 patients had anosmia or hyposmia the olfactory and gustatory disorders were constant and unchanged over the days in 728 of patients whereas they fluctuated in 234 of patients among the patients who reported gustatory and olfactory disorders 38 revealed that these disorders occurred during their rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction episodes among the cured patients who had residual olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction 539 had isolated olfactory dysfunction 225 had isolated gustatory dysfunction and 236 had both olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions there was no significant association between comorbidities and the development of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions olfactory dysfunction was not significantly associated with rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction there was a significant positive association between olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions p  0001 the statistical analysis identified a significant association between the fever and the anosmia p  0014 the females would be proportionally more affected by hyposmia or anosmia compared with males p  0001 similar results were found for gustatory dysfunction p  0001 mannwhitney u test the following general treatments have been considered for patients with the covid-19 infection paracetamol 624 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 98 nasal saline irrigations 96 chloroquine 79 mucolytics 50 and oral corticosteroids 14 with concomitant antibiotics fig 4 the treatments that have been most used for olfactory dysfunction were nasal saline irrigations 167 nasal corticosteroids 81 oral corticosteroids 25 and others 25 eg vitamins non-corticoid decongestants and trace elements fig 4 gustatory dysfunction was treated in 14 of patients four patients received treatment consisting of l-carnitine or trace elements and vitamins telemedicine has been used in 426 of patients for prescribing the treatment over the past few weeks an increasing number of otolaryngologists reported sudden anosmia or hyposmia as concurrent symptoms of covid-19 infection in these patients the diagnosis of covid-19 could be missed because these symptoms were not known to be specific as a result the patients were not isolated and the spread of the virus continued in this context the covid-19 task force of the yo-ifos has conducted this study to investigate the prevalence and the short-term evolution of both olfactory and gustatory disorders based on the national health and nutrition examination survey questions our results support that olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are both prevalent in patients with mild-to-moderate covid-19 infection thus 856 of patients reported olfactory dysfunction 796 of them having anosmia interestingly many profiles of patients have been identified first our data showed that 797 of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea reported hyposmia or anosmia supporting the role of otolaryngologists as the first-line physicians for some covid-19 patients second the olfactory dysfunction may appear before during or after the general symptoms with the occurrence of fever being associated with the olfactory dysfunction there have been few studies on the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in asia since only one study reported hyposmia as a symptom of the covid-19 infection 12 in the study of mao et al patients with peripheral nervous system symptoms attributed to covid-19 infection the most common the most common complaints were hypogeusia 56 and hyposmia 51 12 according to the data of the present study the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is substantially higher in european covid-19 patients in addition to the high prevalence physicians must keep in mind that olfactory disorder may appear before the rest of the complaints in 118 of cases yielding the symptoms important for the early detection of the disease one of the most important questions from the otolaryngologists concerned the recovery of olfactory and gustatory functions although our results are still preliminary it seems that at least 255 of patients recovered both olfactory and gustatory functions throughout the 2 weeks after the resolution of general symptoms considering the time to get a significant reduction of the viral load 10 we have estimated that 56 of patients have persistent olfactory dysfunction over the days following the resolution of the covid-19 general clinical manifestations in the same vein some patients seemed to recover olfaction but not taste and vice versa naturally there are short-term observations and it is reasonable to think that a large number of these patients will recover the olfactory or gustatory functions over the weeks following the disease resolution to summarize the present study clearly supports the recent declarations of many physicians from south korea iran germany italy spain france belgium uk and us that olfactory and gustatory functions may be impaired in covid-19 patients the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in the covid-19 infection are still unknown coronavirus has already been identified as a family of viruses that may be associated with anosmia 6 in 2007 suzuki et al demonstrated that coronavirus may be detected in the nasal discharge of patients with olfactory dysfunction moreover they observed that some patients with normal acoustic rhinometry did not recover their olfaction suggesting that nasal inflammation and related obstruction were not the only etiological factors underlying the olfactory dysfunction in viral infection the ability of human coronavirus to invade the olfactory bulb and therefore the central nervous system is most likely a future research path for improving the knowledge about the clinical presentation of patients from a biomolecular standpoint viruses could infect peripheral neurons using the cell machinery of active transport to access the central nervous system 13 thus for the sars-cov receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 it has been demonstrated on transgenic mice that sars-cov may enter the brain through the olfactory bulb leading to rapid transneuronal spread 14 interestingly authors demonstrated that the virus antigen was first detected 6066 h post-infection and was most abundant in the olfactory bulb regions of the cortex piriform and infralimbic cortices basal ganglia ventral pallidum and lateral preoptic regions and midbrain dorsal raphe were also strongly infected after the virus had spread 14 these regions are connected with the olfactory bulb the rapid spread of sars-cov in the brain was also associated with significant neuronal death in humans autopsy samples from eight patients with sars revealed the presence of sars-cov in brain samples by immunohistochemistry electron microscopy and real-time rt-pcr 15 it is currently suspected that the neuroinvasive potential of sars-cov2 plays a key role in the respiratory failure of covid-19 patients 16 medical imaging and neuropathology will certainly play an important rule to detect abnormalities in olfactory bulb cranial nerves and brain of covid-19 patients the otolaryngological symptoms in our european cohort were particularly prevalent compared with the asian cohorts in their clinical series of 99 patients chen et al reported four patients with rhinorrhea 4 17 then guan et al reported a prevalence of nasal obstruction in 5 of patients in a cohort of 1099 patients 18 the lack of otolaryngological complaints in asian papers eg nasal obstruction rhinorrhea and olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions raises many questions either they did not assess the ent complaints or the chinese patients had a few ent complaints the second hypothesis may be likely regarding previous studies benvenuto et al have recently compared the complete genomes of 15 virus sequences from patients treated in different regions of china with other coronaviruses 19 interestingly they observed mutations of surface proteins spike-s-protein and nucleocapsid-n-protein conferring stability to the viral particle such mutations could be clinically relevant because the viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell whereas the n-protein plays a pivotal role in the virus transcription and assembly efficiency previously chan et al determined five virus sequences from patients traveling in wuhan at the end of december 2019 this study reported identities but less than 68 with the sars-related coronaviruses in specific domains particularly the external subdomain region of receptor-binding domain of the s-protein only presents 39 identity and chan et al propose that it might affect the choice of human receptor and therefore the biological behaviour of this virus 20 the affinity of some viruses for some tissues and individuals constitutes another area to investigate and explain the potential clinical differences between patients from different world regions recent studies suggested that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is the receptor of sars-cov-2 could be specific to certain populations li et al demonstrated that some ace2 variants could reduce the association between human ace2 and sars-cov s-protein 21 in other words the expression level of ace2 in different tissues might be critical for the susceptibility symptoms and outcomes of covid-19 infection 21 moreover the comparison of the 15 expression quantitative trait loci eqtls variants of the ace2 gene suggested that there will be a lot of ace2 polymorphisms and ace2 expression levels between asian and european populations 22 according to these studies it is conceivable that the diversity of ace2 expression pattern in asian and european populations could be an important track that needs further investigation moreover regarding our results future studies have to explore the potential gender differences in the development of anosmia the highest susceptibility of females to develop olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions would be related to the gender-related differences in the inflammatory reaction process 23 the present study has several limitations first our patients did not benefit from specific examinations for olfactory and gustatory functions including psychophysical tests or electrophysiological methods 24 25 the use of objective approaches makes sense for investigating both gustatory and olfactory functions in covid-19 patients and to avoid the confusion related to the retro-olfaction these approaches would provide many responses for patients who may recover olfaction but not taste and vice versa second our patient sample consisted of young and mild-to-moderate covid-19 patients with little comorbidities they may be not representative of the infected population however it seems ethically difficult to investigate olfaction and gustatory function in patients in life-threatening condition such as patients in intensive-care units note that in this study the majority of included patients were identified from hospital laboratory results however many infected physicians completed the study and therefore it remains possible that many infected physicians participated to the study because they suffered from olfactory dysfunction although the authors have been particularly vigilant to this potential bias third the lack of consistent follow-up of our patients limits us from inquiring into the recovery time of olfactory and gustatory functions and therefore the rate of permanent anosmia or ageusia fourth it seems difficult to identify the potential negative impact of nasal and oral corticosteroids on the clinical course of the disease these treatments are usually used for anosmia or in common nasal complaints in the absence of such data the precautionary principle may prevail and according to the guidelines of the french society of otolaryngology patients must avoid corticosteroids for the treatment of the covid-19 infection all of these weaknesses should be considered in future studies to investigate and characterize the olfactory and gustatory functions in covid-19 patients since the disease is new and the virus is most likely associated with different mutations and clinical patterns as of yet there remain more questions than answers this study is the first to identify both olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as significant symptoms in the clinical presentation of the european covid-19 infection based on our results it seems that infected patients may just present olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions without other significant complaints the sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the covid-19 infection future epidemiological clinical and basic science studies must elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of these symptoms in such a specific world population  statistical analysis and visualization of the potential cases of pandemic coronavirus r muthusami k saritha   diseases and bacteria or viruses which cause them often have different names the human immunodeficiency virus hiv for example induces the acquired immunodeficiency disease aids the virus that triggers the current outbreak is called coronavirus 2 a serious acute respiratory syndrome shortened to sars-cov-2 the illness shortened to covid-19 is called coronavirus disease the world health organization and the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv 1 gave these names in public speaking the who also refers to the virus as the virus accountable for covid-19 or the covid-19 virus the outbreak was first reported in wuhan city china wuhan is the capital of the hubei province and has a population of around 11 million chinese authorities reported a cluster of related pneumonia cases in the town on 29 december 2019 a novel coronavirus which was later called sars-cov-2 soon confirmed to cause these cases 27 the first covid-19 cases outside of china were found in thailand on january 13 and in japan on january 16 8 the chinese government put the city of wuhan and other cities in the area on lockdown on january 23 covid-19 has since spread to several more countries-cases have been recorded in all regions of the world it grew into a global pandemic by march 2020 and was announced by the who as such 911 while people sometimes refer to the virus that causes covid-19 as the coronavirus several different coronaviruses do exist the word refers to a group of viruses specific to humans coronaviruses cause about 30 percent of all cold cases 12 corona is latin for crownthis group of viruses is named because under an electron microscope its surface looks like a crown as the outbreak of the novel sarscov2 is increasingly spreading in china and beyond threatening to become a global pandemic epidemiological data need to be interpreted in such a way that the model of statistical data analysis and visualization can increase the understanding of situation among the mass population in the coming days 13 14 the world health organization who johns hopkins university researchers and other agencies all maintain dataset on the number of confirmed infected cases deaths and disease recoveries all data obtained in this research work is from johns hopkins university and is freely accessible via the github repository the dataset covered the period from 22 january 2020 to 17 april 2020 which includes time-series and aggregated data 15 we statistically analyzed our dataset with various methods of data analysis and visualized those data to provide a proper understanding of the covid19 outbreak worldwide our exploit analysis was carried out by johns hopkins university with the 2019 coronavirus dataset januaryapril 2020 here between 22 january 2020 and 17 april 2020 we present an effort to visualize and analyze the results covid19 has so far propagated nearly 185 countriesregions 83 citiesprovinces have been registered and 264 separate geographical locations combined using time-series data it estimated the number of individual cases such as confirmed infected deaths and recovered around the globe and the top 10 countries in the world as of 17 april 2020 the united states and spain are among the top ten countries in the world further to the discussion on different cases such as confirmed illnesses deaths and recovery in those countries as seen in the fig 1 worldwide the total confirmed infected cases are 2152646 and the global average rate is 038 with a standard deviation of 215 the global average rate of the top 10 countries is 773 with a standard deviation of 849 in this circumstance the us ranked first with a total of 667801 the global percentage is 3102 and with a total of 184948 the global percentage of 859 spain is second the estimated number of deaths worldwide is 143800 with a global average of 361 for this situation the us occupied the first place with 32916 counts and with 22170 counts italy was second in the top 10 countries around the world the total number of cases recovered is 542107 in the world in this scenario germany ranked first with a total of 77000 with a total of 74797 spain ranked second and the us ranked fourth with a total of 54703 in the top 10 countries of the world from a statistical data analysis it can be understood that 5 of deaths and 8 of recoveries occurred in reported cases in the united states in spain 10 of deaths and 40 of recoveries occurred in confirmed cases we also explore time-series data using visual data analysis to provide a clear and understandable outcome of this extreme outbreak of covid19 this segment will analyze various time-series data using several visual data analysis approaches with the r programming language we have created a graph and given awareness of how sarscov2 spread around the globe from 22 january 2020 to 17 april 2020 it allows individuals to grasp the epidemiological essence of covid19 figure 1 indicates that the confirmed infected cases have been crossed by 2000000 cases around the globe many cases such as death recovery and active have also been shown new cases reported on a single day do not actually represent new cases on that day as the number of confirmed infected cases or deaths announced by any organizationincluding who ecdc johns hopkins university and othersdoes not reflect the total number of new cases or deaths on that day this is due to the long chain of reporting that occurs between a new case or death and its inclusion in national or international statistics regression and generalized linear models glm of data from the covid-19 time series are used to analyze confirmed infected deaths and recovered cases the fitted models have yielded better statistical results the findings shown below represent all three cases in the usa from the models results obtained on the confirmed case the exponential model coefficients are  0807 and 017 the glm poisson model coefficients are 3469 and 0119 and the glm gamma model coefficients are  0433 and 017 both of which are statistically significant as shown in fig 2 in case of death the exponential model coefficients are  2774 and 0144 the glm poisson model coefficients are  2424 and 0151 both of which are statistically reasonable in the recovered case the exponential model coefficients are  2204 and 0137 the glm poisson model coefficients are  2864 and 0163 both of which are statistically significant from the findings it can be understood that all cases such as confirmed infected deaths and recovered are linearly increased the same thing is reflected in the upper part of the graph ie the output of linear and generalized linear models regression and generalized linear models of the covid-19 time series were also used to analyze confirmed infected death and recovered cases in spain the fitting models have provided better statistical results the findings shown below reflect all three cases in spain here too the count has risen linearly in the confirmed case the exponential model coefficients are  2278 and 0185 the glm poisson model coefficients are 4159 and 0093 both of which are statistically significant in case of death the exponential model coefficients are  2919 and 0152 the glm poisson model coefficients are 1329 and 0104 both of which are statistically fine in the recovered case the exponential model coefficients are  2876 and 0165 the glm poisson model coefficients are 0914 and 0124 both of which are statistically appropriate in the event of an outbreak of an infectious disease it is necessary not only to track the number of deaths but also the rate of increase in the number of deaths if there is a fixed number of deaths over a fixed period of time we call that linear growth but if they continue to double within a fixed time span we call it exponential growth based on the results looking at the rate of death growth we have understood that it is linear growth in the us and spain figure 3 indicates that changes every day occurred in confirmed cases between 22 january 2020 and 17 april 2020 from the usa and spain by this we will conclude that the reported cases will accelerate on 20 march 2020 and that the last day of change is 31451 in the us in spain the confirmed case rises linearly from 03 march 2020 to 15 april 2020 the last day of change is 7304 it is clear that the real-time analysis of these data is extremely useful in documenting the epidemiological behavior of this severe disease we believe that this method of data analysis will certainly increase understanding of the situation and inform behavior this study examined three separate categories of data including confirmed infected death and recovered cases across the globe for the period from 22 january to 17 april 2020 it will also include a comparative overview of all the cases reported in the united states and spain nevertheless we are discussing various cases internationally in order to explain the various cases identified over a particular time span after review 2152646 confirmed cases of covid19 occurred worldwide on 17 april 2020 in the us where the highest count is 667801 the global percentage is 3102 death cases were 143800 across the globe 668 with the us top count being 32916 493 the cases recovered were 542107 around the globe 2518 with germany at the top of the list with a total of 77000 cases the visual analysis of the growth rate of confirmed infected deaths and recovered cases between the us and spain is another investigation the goal of this article on covid-19 is to summarize existing research collect relevant data and make it possible for readers to make sense of the published data and early research on the coronavirus outbreak much of our work focuses on known problems for which we can link with well-established research and evidence on covid-19 the research presented here is based on statistical and visual data analysis methods with the aid of a dataset provided by john hopkins university the research was done with r studio 125033 and r 40 beta versions of the windows 10 operating system each and every description of the different cases of covid19 is documented here between 22 january 2020 and 17 april 2020 we are now also observing the harmful outbreak of the sarscov2 virus to the world this is extremely troubling in this analysis we examined the top 10 countries most affected and comprehensive reported cases of the united states and spain in conclusion the dataset covid-19 2019-ncov from the johns hopkins csse data repository 22 january 2020 to 17 april 2020 was used for our experiment it has supported us to generate and disseminate detailed information to the scientific community and to the public especially at the peak phase in order to understand the growth and impact of the novel coronavirus nevertheless knowledge of this novel sarscov2 virus remains minimal among the general population around the globe raw data published from different sources are not adequately capable of offering an insightful understanding of covid19 as a consequence of sarscov2 a user-friendly data analysis platform would also be more effective in recognizing the epidemic of this severe disease the informative graphics of the visualization platform provide an intuitive interface and a simple view of all raw data hopefully in the coming days we will continue to track the epidemiological data of this outbreak that we have used in this study and from other official sources    this paper presents an open-source computer simulation program developed for simulating tracking and forecasting the covid-19 outbreak the program is built in simulink with a block diagram display the mathematical model used in this program is the sir and seird models represented by a set of differential-algebraic equations it can be easily modified to develop new models for the problem the program uses the outbreaks of china and italy as test models the infection and recovery rate functions are treated as constant variable or a combination of the two in addition an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is employed and proposed to train the model and predict its output the program showed good matching between the simulated and the reported cases and it predicts the final size of the italy outbreak to be 265000 cases at the end of july 2020  oronavirus disease 2019 known as covid-19 or 2019-ncov is a disease caused by a novel virus called sars-cov-2 1  the first reported case of this disease was on dec 31 2019 in wuhan china the outbreak has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization who on jan 30 2020 2  and as a pandemic on march 11 3  the virus spread rapidly around the world and several large-size clusters of the spread have been observed worldwide including outbreaks in china iran italy spain france uk and the usa 4  according to johns hopkins university the total number of confirmed cases surpassed one million cases on april 2 2020 5  an essential part of minimizing the spread of the virus is to monitor track and estimate the final size of the pandemic this is extremely useful for decision making against the public health crises 6  one way to predict the dynamic spread of the epidemic is by the use of computer simulation following the mathematical model of an epidemic in the literature several analytical approaches have been proposed to model the pandemic including susceptible-infected-removed sir model 6 7  susceptible-exposed-infected-removed seir model 1  susceptible-infected-recovered-dead sird model 8 9  and fractional-derivative seir 10  and seird 11  while some recent studies are addressing this epidemic using the aforementioned models 6 7 8 9 10 11  there is an increasing need to develop an open-source computer program to perform a time-domain simulation of the dynamic spread of the virus references 12 13 present matlab code scripts to achieve this objective reference 14 presents a python-based program called chime covid-19 hospital impact model for epidemics for hospital uses it is advantageous to have an educational program that displays the mathematical model of the epidemic in a visualized block diagram instead of a coded script one of the widely-used platforms for studying the dynamic behavior of a system is simulink it has been used by many academic researchers in different fields for simulating a system using time-domain simulations a dynamic system such as the covid-19 epidemic can be mathematically modeled by a set of differential equations des or a set of differential-algebraic equations daes depending on the employed model simulink provides the user with useful mathematical tools including parameter estimation and system optimization which are needed in simulating a pandemic such as covid-19 simulink allows the user to enter and plot the confirmed cases of infection of the disease as an input to the system and then compute the system parameters for instance infection rate recovery rate etc so that the output of the simulation and the collected actual data are equals or very close to each other this paper presents an open-source program for tracking estimating and simulating the coronavirus outbreak unlike the existing models the mathematical model of the outbreak is represented and visualized as a block diagram in simulink using sir and seird representation the infection and recovery rate functions are treated as a constant variable or a combination of them with the application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system anfis the outbreak of china and italy are implemented in simulink using both a standard mathematical model and anfis system 11 sir seir and sird models sir model is a basic representation used widely to describe a disease spread and it is the fundamental model for the other models such as seir and sird sir model consists of threecompartment levels susceptible infectious and removed any individual belongs to one of these groups a brief description of these compartments is given below susceptible individuals are those people who have no immunity to the disease but they are not infectious since there is no vaccine yet developed for this disease we can say that the entire community is exposed to get infected by this disease and hence the susceptible compartment can be represented by the entire population an individual in the susceptible level can move into the next level of the model infectious through contact with an infectious person by this single transmission the number of susceptibleinfectious people reducesincreases by one respectively the next group of people is for the infectious people who have the disease and can spread it to susceptible people infectious people can move to the removed compartment by recovering from the disease the removed compartment includes those who are no longer infectious and the ones who have dies from the disease closed cases the summation of these three compartments in the sir model remains constant and equals the initial number of population a basic sir model is shown in fig 1  where denotes the infection rate or the transmission rate or the force of infection and denotes the recovery or removed rate generally speaking these parameters    are not constant they are functions of the size of infectious and recovery compartments these are the parameters that we want to optimize and estimate so that the reported and simulated cases are approximately equals to solve this set of differential equations we need initial values for the three-state variables   and namely 0  0  and 0  the initial value 0 is the community population impacted by the outbreak 6  whereas 0 is the number of confirmed cases that can be any value but not zero we can set 0 to zero if the start times of the spread and simulation are equals the transmission rate reduces monotonically with time 6  mathematically a standard sir model can be represented using the following differential equations where denotes the total population size     for the seir model an additional compartment is added between the susceptible and infectious compartment called exposed this compartment is dedicated to those people who are infectious but they do not infect others for a period of time namely incubation or latent period note that the summation of the four state-variables at any time stays constant and refers to the incubation period for the sird model an additional compartment is added at the end of the sir model to distinguish between recovered and death cases in the removed compartment note that the ratio gives us an important metric called basic reproductive number or 0  0 is a measure of how contagious a disease is in other words how many people are infected by a single infected person if 0  1 there is a spread of disease which is a strong sign of a pandemic if 0  1 there is a decline in the spread 15  the differential equations 1-3 are built in simulink using the built-in blocks available in the library browser different colors are used to distinguish these equations blue for susceptible red for infectious and green for removed compartment note that the control measure parameters    are functions of time to be found and estimated by the program figure 2 shows the block diagram of the model since reliable long-time data is available only for the case of china we will first consider this test case and simulate it using the sir model all the numerical data for the test cases were taken from 16  the collected data officially reported cases displays some inconvenience observations in the reported cases of infection the evidence is the jump in the curve on feb 13 th  which is reportedly 6 caused by a sudden change in the way the data was collected the proposed method to estimate the variable parameters is to divide the curve either the daily-infection-rate curve or the cumulative-infectious curve into at least two parts around some observed critical points the objective is to cover and better fit the concave-up and -down portions of the curve in this study and for more reliable results the cumulative reported cases graph is split into three periods at two critical points 1 period-1 from time zero until 1 where stands for starting time 2 period-2 from 1 to 2 and 3 period-3 from 2 until the rest of simulation time the critical time points  1 and 2 were chosen empirically based on some observation notes about the given curve it is also possible to let these values variables to be found by the program the total period of time was chosen to be from the day when the first case of the disease was reported until the curve starts to flatten three step-blocks were used for the parameters    these quantities are unknown variables we want to determine their values and the overall shape forms so that the output of our simulation and the collected data are equals the parameter estimation tool in simulink was employed to optimize the system and predict the infection and recovery rates a reasonable set of initial values were selected for the parameters positive values between 0-2 for the recovery gains and negative similar values for the exponential powers used for the infection function figure 3 shows a part of this simulation with the number of iterations values of the parameters at each iteration and the comparison between the collected and simulated data we can observe a quite matching between the two curves after 100 iterations it should be noted that the selection of initial values given to the optimization algorithm plays a significant role in the speed to reach the desired accuracy therefore it is recommended to set reasonable values for these quantities to accelerate the simulation an important indicator of a pandemic is the ratio between the infection and recovery rates or namely the reproduction ratio

reproductive ratio of more than one a sign of pandemic from the beginning of the outbreak until around the inflection point of the curve the numerical results obtained from this simulation are plotted and shown in fig 5a for the china outbreak and fig5b for the itay outbreak the daily infectious state variable is plotted on the left y-axis whereas the cumulative infectious variable is plotted on the right y-axis note that the cumulative infectious is the sum of the daily infectious values which can be modeled in simulink using an integrator as mentioned in 6  the sudden jump in the curve is due to the way the data was collected and the diagnosis techniques which is not interpreted by a natural variation of a pandemic therefore the program tries to change the parameters so that the simulated cumulative cases are close to the actual recorded ones there is a good matching between the two cumulative plots although the daily infectious plots show some mismatch at peak time due to the aforementioned reason for the italy outbreak there is a quite matching between the simulated and the reported cases as there is no change in the calculation method in addition since there is still a relatively high daily-infectious in italy we need to estimate the final size of the epidemic the program estimates the rest of the simulation and the results show that the total cases for italy outbreak could rise to 265000 cases at the end of july 2020 this estimation is based on the given data from the beginning of the reported cases until the date april 09 2020 for the china outbreak it is enough to take data for simulation until the settling time of the curve which is around middle of march 2020 fig 5a shows a zoomed part of the actual simulation time it is worth mentioning that simulink provides several optimization techniques that can be used for this problem including gradient descent nonlinear least square pattern search and simplex search in addition various options are included in the toolbox for instance the gradient descent technique allows applying active-set interior-point trust-region-reflective andor sequential quadratic-programming methods nonlinear least square technique comes with either levenberg-marquardt or trust-regionreflective strategy pattern search strategy involves positive basis np1 and 2n genetic algorithm latin hypercube and nelder mead techniques furthermore the cost function can be selected as either sum squared or absolute error from the simulation experience it is found that the simplex search technique shows faster running time but it ignores the limits specified for the problem the sir model described above does not give information on the exposed people who are infected but not detected yet not confirmed yet it does not provide any knowledge of the closed cases of infectious people who have passed away an exposed variable can be added to the sir model to form a seir model whereas a closed death variable can be added to the sir model to form a sird model these two variables can also be added together to the sir model and form a new model called seird this model is more general and is adopted in this section 11  the differential equations of this model are as follows where refers to the exposed state variable refers to the closed or death case refers to the exposed parameter and refers to the dead variable summing 4-8 should give zero whereas the total sum of the state variables should be constant and equals the population a new simulink program was developed for this model and is shown in fig 6  note that the actual collected data was used as input to this model this data is stored in excel sheets and there is a block in simulink that allows us to import data from external sources and build a customized signal the name of the block is signal builder the ratio between the daily dead and daily infectious is used to represent the mortality rate this signal represents an actual data-based signal which is multiplied by the simulated infectious signal to be integrated and form the cumulative dead variable using an integrator block in simulink in the figure orange color is used for exposed and dark red is used for dead compartments using the same initial values used for the sir model the model gives similar results comparing to the standard model but with two new variables the exposed and mortality cases the parameter optimization process and the numerical outputs are not plotted here owing to its similarity to the above model and for space limitation reasons however all these models and programs are provided with this paper total or partial lockdown social distancing and stay-athome control steps can influence the spread of the virus and flatten the curve earlier if these steps were applied in advance in the simulink model we can represent all these control measures by a step function and simulate the system under these conditions these controls affect the infection rate giving a decline in the beta function on the other hand developing a vaccine or involving any other ways to recover or slow down the disease such as providing the hospitals with all the necessary ventilators affect the recovery-rate parameter by increasing this value as a result the reproduction ratio reduces by any change in these two parameters it is also easy in simulink to see the impact of a delay in response on the curve this can be achieved by adding a delay block to the infection function for instance one can determine the difference in mortality cases if italy took action for instance two weeks earlier by simulating the same system and adding a delay to the infectious rate signal however more details about the model are needed for this problem  cc-by 40

machine-learning program to simulate the same system using the input and output data of the model simulink provides the user with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system anfis toolbox to generate if-then fuzzy rules automatically based on training the given data references 17 present a detailed description of this technique in which the same methodology is employed in this paper using a basic sir model built in simulink with a variable infection rate and constant recovery rate the model is trained using input-out data the input could be the infection rate recovery rate or a combination of the two the output could be the infectious output or its cumulative function in this study the beta function and its derivative are used as input variables to the anfis model whereas the infectious and cumulative infectious variables are chosen for the output in two different training processes anfis allows us to use only one output for each block and for this reason two separate processes are used to generate two anfis blocks for the two outputs more outputs require more anfis blocks figure 7 shows a simple simulink program used in this training the recovery function is treated as constant as proposed in 6 whereas the infection rate is treated as variable 6  with the parameters optimized the anfis toolbox is used to generate seven fuzzy rules for each output the membership function used in this training is the gaussian function figure  8a -c shows the training iterations fuzzy rules and the anfis outputs for the cumulative and infectious variables figure 9 shows the simulink model for the anfis blocks used in this simulation these if-then rules are used to simulate the case of china outbreak and the results are shown in fig 10a  whereas fig 10b shows the infections and recovery parameter values notably the results show some good matching but it needs improvement a more detailed and complicated beta function formula can be used to improve the accuracy of the results this paper presents an open-source program to model simulate and predict the coronavirus covid-19 outbreak using simulink several models were employed including a simple sir representation with constant recovery rate and a one-step beta function sir with three step-functions and a more detailed seird model in addition an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system was used to generate the output of the model based on some training tasks applied to the system the tests used in this study were the cases of china and italy outbreaks the results obtained showed good matching between the simulated and reported cases it also estimates the case of italy to reach around 265000 cases at the end of july 2020 this paper promises some lasting values in the field of the coronavirus spread the program can

of covid-19 in italy luca dellaposanna  we present a simple but realistic model for describing the diffusion of an infectious disease on a population of individuals the dynamics is governed by a single functional delay differential equation which in the case of a large population can be solved exactly even in the presence of a time-dependent infection rate this delay model has a higher degree of accuracy than the so-called sir model commonly used in epidemiology which instead is formulated in terms of a set of three ordinary differential equations we apply our model to describe the outbreak of the new virus covid-19 in italy taking into account the containment measures implemented by the government in order to mitigate the spreading of the virus and the social costs for the population  in a very few months a viral infection called covid-19 coronavirus disease 19 originated in china breaking through the borders of all the countries rapidly spread all over the globalized world italy is one of the hardest hit countries suffering from the very dramatic consequences of this disease the outbreak of the virus the new coronavirus which caused the infection seems out of our control in the absence of a therapy and a vaccine social distancing measures and a strict lockdown appear to be the most effective means to contain the growth of the infection we should remind that there are places in the world where often infectious diseases also those already defeated in the so-called more developed countries can still cause very severe consequences among the local populations even if we cannot answer the question why a virus starts spreading and which is its origin we can still wonder how it diffuses the aim of this work is therefore to provide a simple handy model for epidemic spreading which could depend only on the couple of parameters which generally characterize an infectious disease the infection rate and the infectiousness or recovery time both these quantities can be taken from the experience therefore we do not need further parameters to fit the data which could cause artificial predictions we will show that the model we are presenting have the same or even higher predictive power than that of one of the most widely used technique in epidemiology the sir model 1 2 3  this latter model requires the presence of a fictitious recovery rate related to the number of recovered persons without considering that the new cases of recovery and fatality come from infected cases occurring a period of time earlier the model we are proposing instead is based on the fact that the closed cases come from the infected ones after an average delay recovery time therefore contrary to the sir model formulated in terms of a set of three ordinary differential equations it is described by just a single equation a functional retarded differential equation bringing predictions more under control in this work we derive the exact analytical solution of this model in the limit of large population number also in the presence of a time-dependent infection rate which is the case when containment measures are implemented in order to reduce the spreading of the infection moreover the definition of the so-called basic reproduction number r 0 a parameter determining whether a infectious disease can spread or not comes out naturally in our delay model we finally apply this technique to give a quantitative description of the diffusion of covid-19 in italy showing the current scenario based on the actual situation and what would have happened without the containment measures generally it is quite difficult to give a reliable forecast on the fate of the epidemic spreading because it heavily depends on individual and social behaviors on the effectiveness of the containment measures already implemented or that will be taken by the government and on the future political decisions at the time being even if the situation in italy is improving it seems that more efforts are needed in order to change course and rapidly stop the spreading of the disease further measures might be useful like for instance i running more diagnostic tests at least on all the doctors and medical workers who are in contact with many patients ii improving the food distribution to avoid the crowding in the food shops and to ensure subsistence goods also to those who need iii providing medical devices like surgical masks to all the population as last remark we remind that the outbreak of covid-19 has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization many countries are already heavily overwhelmed by this infection and by the risk for the public health therefore in a networked world we all have to behave and operate with an improved spirit of cooperation the bitter lesson imparted by this tough situation is that we cannot save ourselves alone let us first consider the case in which a population of individuals subjected to an infection is not too large or the infection is such that the recovery time for an infected person is sufficiently long in this conditions one can expect that the epidemic diffusion is governed by the logistic equation equivalent to the so-called si model whose solution is simply given by where 1 is that it does not contain the mechanism of reduction of the spreading and the desired end of an epidemic disease we have therefore to take into account the number of closed cases persons who recovered or died which do not contribute to the infection anymore the model we are going to consider includes therefore the total number of infected f t and the total number of recovered and deceased persons rt so that eq 2 becomes in principle also rt can follow another dynamical equation however generally there is an average time of recovering t so that the total number of cases at some time t becomes closed cases at later time t  t namely this seems to be the case also for the new coronavirus spreading by looking at some reported data for covid-19 in italy shown in fig 1 see also ref 4  eq 4 allows us to write eq 3 in terms of only the function f t notice that as we will discuss later eq 3 can be derived also from the sir model if we consider the case where the population p is very large as long as f t p we can neglect the logistic term 1  f t p 1 so to have where  is the heaviside theta function eq 5 is a functional retarded differential equation writing the time t as t  n t  t  where n  t t is the integer part of tt the solution of eq 5 is given by where the functions a fulfill the following iterative equation with a 0 t  0 for any t  t and a 0 t  1 so that for  1 we recover a 1 t  e rt  the full exact solution is therefore obtained by solving a cascade of n local integrals the proof of eqs 6 and 7 is given in appendix a  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

time t  n t from eq 7 performing the chain of integrals and putting the results in eq 6 we get the following exact result for instance for n  1 and n  2 namely up to twice the infectiousness period the total number of cases is simply surprisingly we find that eq 8 depends only on r t which is called basic reproduction number r 0 see below it is easy to check from eq 8 that while for large r 0  rt f nt is dominated by an exponential behavior for r 0  1 f nt becomes linear in n from eq 6 and eq 7 we can notice that the function f t depends on its past therefore it seems governed by a non-makovian dynamics once we have the total number of infections f t we can also calculate the number of persons who are still infected at a given time t which is defined by in our model  so that eq 5 in terms of this quantity is simply df t dt  r it before to proceed a comment on the comparison with another model is in order the so-called sir model is one of the most used techniques for describing the spreading in time of an infection disease according to this model the population is divided into three parts represented by the number of susceptible st infected it and recovered rt individuals which vary over time see appendix b this model is almost equivalent to our simpler model eq 3-4 however a criticism which can be raised against the sir model is related to the fact that being formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations the model requires the presence of an effective recovery and fatality rate which might not correspond to the actual rate since the new cases of recovery and fatality come from infected cases occurring a few days earlier for that reason instead of writing the problem in terms of ordinary differential equations one has to do it in terms of functional differential equations let us consider eq 5 for t  t in the following form where we introduce and naturally identify r 0 as the so-called basic reproduction number which is a widely used parameter for predicting whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or turns off and represents the average number of cases originated by a single infectious case during the infectiousness period eq 11 implies that the first derivative of f t is equal to its increment in a time interval t divided by t namely increases more than linearly while for r  t 1 r 0  1 f t goes slower than linearly if we let r vary in time when r  t 1 r 0  1 the function f t has an inflection point where it changes from being concave to convex or vice versa making a comparison with the sir model where r 0  r one can identify  the fictitious recovery rate see appendix b with the inverse of the recovery time   1t let us now consider the possibility of having a time-dependent infection rate rt in the dynamical equation for the total number of infected persons  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

exact solution valid for any profile of rt can be written in the same form of eq 6 namely where now the functions a are given by for instance  and so on for constant r eq 14 reduces to eq 7 see appendix a for more details about the derivation the solution f t has therefore to fulfill the following recursive equation after splitting the time in n intervals t with the residual time t this general result implies that if we knew the time dependence of the infection rate or if we could tailor its evolution by for instance containment measures we can know the exact analytical expression of f t the total number of infected persons as a function of time as long as f t is much smaller than p let us consider the delay model in its general form eqs 3- 4 where the infection rate r varies in time as the effect of some containment measures taken in order to reduce the impact of an infection on the population as an example let us suppose that rt is modified by social distancing measures lockdown and the shutdown of many work activities as in it is happening in italy and in many other countries to mitigate and reduce the spreading of the new coronavirus covid-19 after two main decrees imposed by the italian prime minister ordering the lockdown of the whole national territory taken on march 11-th lockdown and shutdown of many stores and march 22-th 2020 shutdown of many factories and strengthening of social distancing measures after some other measures taken right before for local regions eg the decree of march 8-th for the lockdown of lombardy and other areas as a result we can imagine that rt decreases smoothly after those dates taking into account the adaptation time for the individuals to the new social behaviors and the period needed to complete the last activities before the blockade of the factories let us suppose therefore that rt can change in time according to a smooth step function as in eq 17  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

times where the steps are located  1 and  2 make the function to be smooth r 1 is the initial observed infection rate which causes the starting exponential growth of the epidemic disease r 2 the intermediate rate which fits with the data supposed to be reached after the first decree of lockdown and r 3 the supposed asymptotic infection rate after the second decree of lockdown fixing the average of recovery and fatality time t the basic reproduction number is also a function of time according to r 0  rtt with a profile shown in fig 2  solving eq 16 or analogously using the recursive relation in eq 15 with the time-dependent rate rt given by eq 17 fixed by the parameters producing the profile depicted in fig 2  we obtain the solution f t which slowly goes to saturation over time in perfect agreement with the data for the total number of confirmed infected cases as shown by fig 3  where the blue line is the expected curve while the red points are the official data the dotted gray lines in fig 3 represent f t if the containment measures had not been taken as one can see from figs 2-3 only when r 0 becomes smaller than 1 the curve flattens allowing for a stop of the epidemic spreading avoiding that a large part of the population gets infected for r 0 1 f t would increase linearly and it would become almost constant meaning that the number of new infections would be equal to the number of closed cases a reliable forecast has to take into account the fact that the official data of infectious cases are made by counting mostly the symptomatic cases probably discarding other infectious cases which could transfer the virus even without or with mild symptoms moreover the data of both the total number of infected persons and that of the recovered ones could be affected by the procedure the realization times and the number of the diagnostic tests however since our model relies on the infectiousness time it does not need a fitting of the data for recovered persons which may be affected by systematic errors this uncertainty on the data for closed cases would compromise the result for the sir model on the contrary our theoretical prediction based on the delay model agrees fairly well with the data-set for total infected cases as shown in fig 3  as a final remark we remind that most of the confirmed infected cases in italy are counted after the appearance of the symptoms and the persons who exhibit severe ones are mostly hospitalized and then counted as infected persons some of them unfortunately die approximately 4 days after therefore after approximately 9 days form the onset of the first symptoms as reported by the istituto superiore di sanit wwwissit we observe that splitting the closed cases between real recovered persons r r  and dead persons r d  and since the confirmation of recovery needs extra diagnostic tests which are still not widely performed the most reliable data is that of dead persons r d t which is found to be linked to the total number of confirmed infected cases f t in the following way with   1 7 and a delay time of t d  4 days as show in fig 4  the number of victims follows the number of total confirmed cases and it is equal to 17 of its value four days before the fatality of the sick persons those who exhibit some symptoms is therefore quite high lim t r d t  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it

present a simple but realistic model for describing epidemic spreading based on the fact that the closed cases come from infected ones at an early time this observation allows us to formulate the problem in terms of a single functional differential equation depending on two well defined clinically relevant parameters the infection rate and the infectiousness time we provide the exact analytical solution for such an equation in the limit of large population number finding that it depends exclusively on the basic reproduction number r 0  rt see eq 8 we derive the analytic solution also in the presence of a generic time-dependent infection rate we apply our model to the case of the spreading of covid-19 in italy allowing the infection rate to vary in time as a result of some containment measures implemented by the government in order to mitigate the consequences of the infection on the population we find perfect agreement between the official data and the expected theoretical results in general terms the basic reproduction number should be suppressed well below 1 in order to rapidly recover the initial condition by a rough estimation in order to have a decline of the infection as fast as its growth containment measures or possible therapies should be so effective to reduce the basic reproduction number and reach the final value r 0f such that r 0f r0i 2r0i1  starting from an initial value r 0 i  in the case of covid-19 in italy the initial value for the basic reproduction number was r 0i 26 while the current one seems to settle at r 0f 08 implying a rather slow decline of the infection finally we discussed the fatality rate showing that the number of victims is exactly a fraction of the total number of cases few days before  cc-by-nc-nd 40

describes the dynamics of the number of susceptible st infected it and recovered rt persons according to the following differential equations with generally the initial condition s0 p the free

41 namely that the sum of the three functions is constant and equal to the population p for any t since at the beginning s0  i0  p therefore which is nothing but the logistic term so that eq 40 is exactly equal to eq 3 where   r this implies that one equation among eqs 36-38 is redundant therefore instead of considering three equations one can take just two for instance we can choose to express the time evolution in terms of f t and rt  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

so that 1  f tp  1 from eqs 43 and 44 we have meaning that only if  is smaller than     the infection shuts down one can introduce the so-called basic reproduction number r 0 which predicts whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or die out and represents the average number of cases originated by a single infectious case in a totally susceptible population during the infectiousness period this quantity is defined as and from eq 45 one can see that only for r 0  1 the infection turns off we notice that eq 43 is equal to eq 3  the difference between the delay model described by eqs 3-4  and the sir model described by eqs 43-44 is that in our model the number of closed cases rt is locked to be equal to the total cases at a former time f t  t an average recovery period t before in other words in the delay model eq 44 is substituted by eq 4 which is equivalent to eq 44 with    but with a different initial condition rt  f 0 the delay time allows us to define the basic reproduction number more naturally as the number of new infections during the infectiousness time t on the contrary in the sir model one has to artificially adjust the rate  to take into

due to a lack of eligible patients while the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size moreover we used a terminal or cure rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement rmti in this context to analyze the reconstructed data due to the existence of death as competing risk and a terminal event the remdesivir trial of beigel et al reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups and the rate ratio for recovery while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information we reanalyzed the data to report other percentiles of the time to recovery

quantify the survival difference in randomized clinical trials it is no longer an interpretable quantity if the proportional hazards ph assumption is violated 20  by contrast the rmst has the advantages of being nonparametric and model-free yet carrying clinically meaningful interpretations given the pre-specified time point   the estimate of the rmst difference between two groups can be interpreted as the extra survival gain on average during the time- followup period clinical trials during the epidemic of an infectious disease might fail to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients if the outbreak can be quickly controlled 22  however early termination of a clinical trial would inevitably lead to loss of power  in the original analysis of cao et al 7

mortality rate was not low with severe hospitalized covid-19 patients 192 in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 250 in the standard care group the original analysis 7 treated death before day 28 as right-censored at day 28 no matter when death had occurred this may cause ambiguity because it cannot distinguish the situations where all deaths in one group occurred earlier while those in the other group occurred later as death is a terminal event a terminal or cure rate model would be more appropriate for analysis of such data a terminal rate model can be viewed as the counterpart of the traditional mixture cure rate model 13 14 15 16  which can be developed by slight modifications as death is a terminal event patients who died during the 28-day follow-up period would never reach the clinical improvement ie the time to clinical improvement was infinity denoted as   death can also be viewed as competing risk for clinical improvement the upper panel of table 1 shows that neither was

an increasingly important role in oncology trials the advantages of adaptive design may be mitigated to large extent under such a fast patient enrollment because the impact of any adaptation may be

financial crisis and recession of the post-war period world growth continues to be slow and even falling in most countries there is now even the risk that the world could be drifting toward a new global financial crisis and recession this paper examines the reasons for 1 the slow recovery of the united states after the recent global financial crisis 2 the united states growing faster than other advanced countries particularly europe and japan 3 growth slowing in most emerging market economies and 4 the prospects of the world facing a new global financial crisis 
table 1
shows that at the depth of the recession in 2009 the percentage fall of real gdp among the largest advanced nation ranged from 28 for the united states to 56 for germany and it was 45 in the euro area as a whole 29 in canada 43 in the united kingdom and 54 in japan despite powerful traditional and non-traditional qe expansionary monetary and fiscal policies the recovery from 2010 to 2017 was slow in all advanced nations averaging 21 percent in the united states 13 percent in the eu-19 or euro area which even fell back into recession in 2012 and 2013 20 percent in the united kingdom 15 percent in japan and 23 percent in canada britain and canada fared generally better than the euro area and japan since the end of the crisis with growth rates comparable to those in the united states japan suffered six recessions during the past twenty-five years including in the ones 2011 and 2014 and was facing a new recession in 2020 the recovery and growth from the recent global financial crisis and great recession in the united states was the slowest of all the us recessions of the post-war period fig 1
shows that the average yearly growth of real gdp following the 20082009 recession averaged only 21 percent over the 20092017 period and as such it was the slowest of all the 11 recession that the united states faced over the 19492017 period the general reasons for this are also more or less clear a reduction in the growth of labor productivity and labor force in the united states fig 2
shows that the growth of labor productivity and labor force have been smaller drivers of potential us growth since the global financial crisis than in previous decades and are expected to remain smaller in the next decade  the only exception is the slower growth of labor productivity in the 19741981 period there are however some major disagreements on the more basic underlying causes for the slow us growth after the crisis supply-siders believe that the slow us growth was the result of low growth of labor productivity excessive economic regulations and inadequate social and physical infrastructures demand-siders on the other hand blame inadequate infrastructure investments and rising income inequalities that dampened private consumption during the first three years of his administration trump adopted many of the growth policies that he promised on the campaign trail on the taxation front the trump administration passed a tax reform bill that lowered the federal corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent with personal income taxes reduced from 7 to 4 brackets of 10 percent 25 percent 35 percent and 37 percent trump was also able to obtain funding for more infrastructure investments and the military but not as much as he promised because of the very large increase in budget deficits and national debt that they would entail on the domestic regulatory front the trump administration rolled back parts of the doddfrank act of 2010 reduced many regulations imposed during the eight years of the obama and of previous administrations and repealed the individual mandate that required every employee to have health care but he did not succeed in repealing the affordable care act or obamacare as a whole as he had promised to do during the presidential campaign and as of the end of february 2020 trump was able only to get partial funding for the wall on the mexican border to reduce illegal migration on the international front as he had promised trump dropped out of the trans pacific partnership tpp put the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip on hold and dropped out of the paris climate accord he negotiated a new trade agreement with south korea renegotiated nafta now usmca and is negotiating a new trade agreement with japan trump also imposed a tariff of 25 percent on us steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on us aluminum imports from many nations trump also started a trade war with china by imposing a 25 percent tariff on nearly 370 billion of chinese exports to the united states which remained in place despite signing a phase-one trade agreement with china in january 2020 this in retaliation for chinas large scale and systematic stealing of us intellectual property and in order to bring back some manufacturing to the united states and in the hope of reducing the huge and unsustainable us trade deficit with china white house office of trade and manufacturing policy 2018 trump predicted that his policies would lift us growth to more than 2530 percent per year as shown in table 1 us growth did indeed rise to 29 percent in 2018 but it then fell to 23 percent in 2019 and it is forecasted to be 20 percent in 2020 and 17 percent in 2021 refer table 1 it seems that the bump in growth in 2018 was primarily the result of the tax reform which caused a sharp increase in the us budget deficit but this was only temporary as it now seems that us growth is reverting back to the post-crisis average of about 2021 percent per year although the us recovery after the recent global financial crisis was the slowest of all its post-war recessions it was faster than in europe see fig 3
 the figure shows that starting at about the same level in 1983 the gdp in purchasing power parity terms ppp at 2014 dollars grew more slowly in the euro area than in the united states salvatore 1998 salvatore 2004 salvatore 2007 and that the divergence widened significantly from the start of the global financial crisis in 2008 until 2015 but why was the great recession so deep and the recovery so slow in the united states and other advanced countries one important reason is that the great recession was triggered and accompanied by a banking and financial crisis and experience indicates reinhart  rogof 2009 that this type of crisis is much more difficult and takes much longer to overcome than a purely economic crisis because it is usually accompanied by heavy deleveraging by the banking sector but there also other more specific reasons that made this recovery and growth so slow the most important of these is the sharp decline in labor productivity in advanced nations since the recent global financial crisis table 2
shows that while us labor productivity increased at a yearly average of 24 percent in 19992006 it rose by only 10 percent in 20072018 comparable figures in percentages were respectively 18 and 04 for japan 24 and 02 in the united kingdom 15 and 05 for the euro area and 19 and 07 for the european union of 28 eu-28 population growth also continued to slow down after the great recession considerably in most advanced nations but again more so in europe than in the united states with the growth of labor productivity and labor force declining the growth of advanced nations declined another reason for slower growth and less job creation in the united states and other advanced countries was outsourcing most multinational corporations from advanced nations in their effort to minimize production costs transferred a great deal of production and jobs to emerging market economies especially china during the past decade this started before the recent global financial crisis but it rapidly accelerated afterwards rising protectionism since the great recession however caused disruptions in the global supply chains thus reversing to some extent the globalization process even before trump and this slowed down growth in the united states and the rest of the world growth was also discouraged in advanced nations by high taxes overregulation and policy uncertainty  again more so in europe than in the united states and the united kingdom as shown in fig 4
 to be noted is that the difference in growth between the united states and europe is somewhat less on a per capita than in total because of the higher population growth in the united states than in europe salvatore 2017 after their spectacular growth before the global financial crisis growth also slowed in emerging market economies as a result of the crisis klein  salvatore 2013 the economic crisis in emerging market economies started as a result of contagion as the recession-afflicted advanced nations sharply cut imports from and the flow of investments to emerging markets during the global financial crisis this was one reason for the decline in chinas previous spectacular growth while indias growth held up the average annual percentage growth of real gdp in other large emerging countries those in the g20 group has been very slow with exception of china india and indonesia  see table 3
 the slowdown in chinas growth rate from 2010 to 2017 however was also the result of the effort to restructure its economy toward more internal demand and from a manufacturing to a service economy rather than relying on continued export growth and on heavy domestic investments as in the past the former because it was no longer sustainable and the latter because of the setting in of the dreaded diminishing returns in the process chinas demand for primary commodity imports from other emerging markets especially from brazil and many african countries also declined sharply this caused an even greater growth slowdown in other emerging market economies than the decline resulting from the recession in advanced countries starting in 2018 chinas growth slowed further as a result of the uschina trade war as discussed in section 4 the growth forecast of china and other countries shown in table 3 also does not take into consideration the reduction of growth of china and the rest of the world as a result of the coronavirus covid-19 that struck china in december 2019 and spread to many other nation in the beginning of 2020 of course if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic as feared in february 2020 the new york times 2020 there could be a very deep world recession in 2020 as the demand for their primary exports of emerging market economies declined their currencies sharply depreciated or were devalued thus making the servicing of their previously accumulated heavy financial debt and dollar borrowings of over 6 trillion by 2018 unsustainable emerging market economies also experienced large net financial outflows which exacerbated their economic problems even more brazil faced recession with a decline of real gdp of 35 in 2015 and 2016 russia faced even more economic difficulties as a result also of the wars and the economic sanctions imposed on it and argentina and turkey also faced an economic crisis the economic crisis in most emerging market economies would have been even deeper had they not been operating under some form of exchange rate flexibility or had not devalued their currencies which cushioned to some extent their reduction in exports and had they not also entered the crisis with more foreign exchange reserves accumulated during the commodity boom of the previous decade 
fig 5
shows oecd 2019 that the uschina trade restriction imposed from july 2018 through august 2019 would reduce business investment after 23 years with respect to the baseline by about 28 percent in china 25 percent in the united states 23 percent in the euro area and 15 percent in japan and it would reduce chinas growth by about 10 percent us growth by 07 percent and world growth by 06 percent but if the uschina trade war progresses and intensifies in 2020 the economic harm in terms of the reduction in world growth would be much higher especially if other nations are also drawn into the trade war the uschina trade war is almost certain to also worsen the other economic weaknesses in the world economy today these are 1 the excessive total indebtedness in the chinese economy now in excess of 275 percent of its gdp 2 emerging markets total indebtedness in dollars which now exceeds 6 trillion and in the face of an appreciating dollar 3 the new financial bubble arising from nominal interest rates near zero in the united states britain and canada and negative in japan the euro area as well as in denmark sweden and switzerland thus leading to inflated stock markets and also leading investors in search for returns to undertake excessively risky investments and now february 2020 we can add 4 the effect of the coronavirus or covid-19 for the result of other similar simulation exercises see oecd 2016 and salvatore and campano 2018 each of these weaknesses or dangers could on its own trigger a new global financial crisis and recession but in the current trade-war situation each could actually lead to a perfect storm ie a global financial crisis even deeper than the previous one at a time when most advanced nations have fewer and less effective monetary and fiscal policies tools to deal with it in december 2019 the united states and china signed the phase-one agreement which avoided a further escalation of their trade war but with the united states leaving tariffs of 25 percent in place on nearly 370 billion of imports from china until a more extensive trade agreement is hopefully reached in 2020 this will continue to reduce international trade and growth but even if such an agreement were reached strong international trade controversies are likely to recur in the future especially between the united states and china unless the wto were reformed and strengthened and a truly rule-based international trade system were established after a decade from the end of the deepest global financial crisis and recession of the post-war period world growth continues to be slow and even falling in most countries there is now even the risk of the world drifting toward a new global financial crisis two very important reasons for the slow recovery and growth in the united states and other advanced countries after the recent global financial crisis have been the decline in the growth of labor productivity and the labor force since these declines have been greater in europe than in the united states the former has grown slower than the latter the reason the growth of labor productivity has been slower in europe than in the united states was due mostly to the higher taxation and excessive regulations in europe than in the united states since his election president trump has reduced us taxes and regulations and increased expenditure for infrastructures and the military these policies did increase us growth but only temporarily and led to much higher budget deficits accusing most nation of not engaging in fair trade trump also imposed higher tariffs on us imports of steel aluminum and other products on many countries and started a trade war with china which reduced us and world growth in the highly interdependent and globalized world of today the slower growth of advanced nations and china reduced the growth of most other emerging market economies among the g20 market economies only china india and indonesia are growing rapidly even though chinas two digits growth rate prior to the global financial crisis has been cut in half the world is now facing the danger of another and possibly deeper financial crisis and recession if the uschina trade war resumes a crisis can also be triggered or amplified by the excessive indebtedness in the chinese informal banking sector by emerging markets total indebtedness in dollars from the financial bubble arising from nominal interest rates near zero in the united states britain and canada and negative in japan the euro area and other nations and if the coronavirus turned into a pandemic  rna virus reverse genetics and vaccine design christopher stobart c martin moore l   vaccines remain one of the greatest accomplishments of human ingenuity scientific endeavor and the combined global efforts of the public health community the rates of incidence and mortality associated with infection by rna viruses such as polio measles mumps and rubella have declined by greater than 95 compared to pre-vaccination rates 1 though highly successful in the past conventional approaches to rna virus vaccine development such as live-attenuation through passaging forward genetics or inactivation may be less efficient for generating good candidates than rational targeted mutagenesis reverse genetics advancements in recombinant dna technology and virus reverse genetics have provided key critical insights into the replication and pathogenesis of rna viruses and facilitate vaccine development through targeted modifications and directed attenuation the advent of reverse genetics and molecular engineering of viruses has transformed the field of virology by permitting study of targeted genetic changes in virus genomes in 1981 the first infectious rna virus clone was isolated from cdna to generate poliovirus 2 since then reverse genetics technology and recombinant virus design has been employed to generate reverse genetic clones representing all major virus families in addition these techniques and approaches have now become the focus of new efforts to design vaccines that incorporate specific changes in either component-based or virus-based systems to induce lasting immunity in the host without health risks or deleterious effects  since the development of effective live-attenuated vaccines new vaccine preparations utilizing well-established vectors expression of specific viral proteins or components subunit vaccines and development of virus-like particles vlps have continued to shape the domain of vaccine discovery and development the challenge of establishing a safe immunogenic platform which induces lasting immunity in the context of a wide variety of viral systems has resulted in remarkable creativity and variability in the approaches employed use of replicating viruses in vaccines such as live-attenuated or chimeric vector-based platforms have the benefits of high immunogenicity lower costs and ease to transport and administer yet these viruses have the potential to revert to more pathogenic phenotypes and may be under-attenuated in immunocompromised hosts conversely component subunit or killed pathogen vaccines have the benefits of generally being safer and can be used to display the most immunogenic antigens however the costs time of development and weaker induced immune responses present their own challenges to design and implementation in this review we describe rna virus reverse genetics systems and provide an overview of current efforts to use reverse genetics technology in the development of safe and effective vaccines current rna virus reverse genetics systems make use of multiple common features of rna virus biology first rna viruses generate genomic copies through the activity of a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp in addition nearly all rna virus replication strategies are independent from the host cell nucleus and instead reside in the cytoplasm for positive-strand rna viruses such as poliovirus immediately after entry and uncoating the genomic rna is directly translated by host ribosomes to generate viral protein products since the virus rarely needs to package additional nonstructural proteins in the virion most positive-sense rna virus reverse genetics systems largely focus on delivery of either transcribed genomic rna into the cell cytoplasm or delivery of cdna under the control of a viral transcription promoter such as t7 or cmv figure 1 345678910 however negative-strand and double-strand rna virus reverse genetic systems often require the use of additional helper constructs to introduce the rdrp and other essential proteins to initiate genomic replication a recent alternative approach which has been employed in the field of influenza research is to synthesize viral rna and drive mrna production through the activity of the host polymerases such as pol i and pol ii 1112 this approach has simplified the logistics of plasmid transfection and increased the efficacy of recombinant virus recovery a similar approach has been successfully employed for recovery of an arenavirus lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus lcmv 13 one additional platform that has been employed for rna virus infectious clone generation is the bacterial artificial chromosome bac bac constructs are single-copy dna plasmids based on the f-plasmid of bacteria which are genetically stable in e coli and permit the insertion of large dna fragments to be transcribed under the control of a transcriptional promoter such as t7 bac constructs have been employed for many years in the recovery of large dna viruses however the genetic stability of these constructs has led to their use in recombinant rna virus platforms several positive-strand rna viruses and one negative-strand rna virus have used bacs as a platform for reverse genetic design table 1 since most rna virus replication strategies are segregated from the host genome and replication machinery few rna viruses modify host gene expression and cause oncogenesis as a result rna reverse genetic systems do not typically have to account for the potential transformation of host cells lastly most rna viruses are limited to small genome sizes with the majority smaller than 15 kb due to reduced genomic stability and the lowered fidelity of the viral rdrp subsequently reverse genetic approaches often employ the use of cdna genetic clones for greater versatility in manipulation and modification of the virus genome  picornaviruses are a family of non-enveloped positive-strand rna viruses which collectively infect a wide range of human and animal hosts human picornaviral pathogens cause illnesses which vary from the common cold to poliomyelitis the picornavirus virion consists of an icosahedral capsid structure surrounding an rna genome ranging from approximately 7 to 9 kb in size poliovirus and rhinovirus remain two of the most extensively studied picornaviruses to date and have become model systems for the study of rna virus biology pathogenesis and epidemiology during the 1950s extensive efforts began to develop and implement a polio vaccine in the hopes to eradicate the virus since no non-human primate reservoirs are known to exist in nature the effectiveness of the inactivated salk vaccine and live-attenuated sabin vaccines led to increased efforts to develop and design vaccines for many other human pathogens international vaccination efforts are aimed at eradicating the disease the success and employed strategies for implementation of vaccines for poliovirus opened the door to evaluating new approaches and efforts to study and understand rna virus biology a major step occurred in 1981 when racaniello and baltimore introduced a full-length cdna clone of poliovirus into a cell and recovered infectious virus 2 although initially the mechanism by which a cdna clone in a plasmid could give rise to productive rna virus infection was unknown the cdna platform approach used by racaniello and baltimore was rapidly adapted to develop similar reverse genetics systems for a number of picornaviruses including coxsackie b virus 24 rhinovirus 25 hepatitis a virus 26 theilers virus 27 foot and mouth disease virus 28 swine vesicular disease virus 29 and two echoviruses 3031 advances in the understanding and engineering of plasmids for gene delivery led to more efficient cdna-based systems which represent the primary reverse genetics approaches used for recovery of picornaviruses today  no commercially available rhinovirus vaccines exist today despite effective reverse genetics platforms for several serotypes rhinoviruses remain the primary cause of the common cold worldwide and have been extensively studied for over 50 years yet the great puzzle of developing a broadly protective rhinovirus vaccine involves solving the overwhelming task of developing an immunogenic platform which can provide protective immunity to the greater than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus that currently circulate in nature 3233 the capsid of rhinovirus is comprised of four distinct serotype-specific proteins vp1 vp2 vp3 and vp4 which are known to be immunogenic and potentially elicit cross-reactive antibodies 32343536 yet development of broadly-neutralizing rhinovirus protection will likely require the formulation of a polyvalent vaccine which includes incorporation of several serotype variants of the immunogenic capsid proteins 36 efforts at designing polyvalent rhinovirus vaccine formulations have yet to provide the broad immunogenic memory necessary to be effective however regions of vp0 precursor of vp2 and vp4 have been shown to be conserved across a and b group rhinoviruses and combination with a th1 promoting adjuvant induced a crossserotype immune response in mice 34 the discovery of conserved epitopes and recent development of chimeric or new reverse genetics platforms including a mouse model of infection may provide a novel avenue to the efficient display of epitopes from the breadth of rhinovirus diversity 373839 coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand rna viruses which encode the largest known rna virus genomes varying in size from 26 to 32 kb 40 coronavirus infections in humans are associated with upper and lower respiratory illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars over the last 12 years four new human coronaviruses have been identified including sars coronavirus and the recent middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus 41 despite a high clinical and economic burden and potential for emerging infectious disease no commercially available vaccines currently exist  there are currently two common platforms that are used for generating full-length infectious coronavirus clones the first platform involves in vitro transcription and capping of a full-length cdna clone of the coronavirus genome followed by introduction into competent cells by either transfection or electroporation the coronavirus genome which is approximately 30 kb in size is often maintained as fragments in low-copy plasmids during virus assembly the fragments are restriction digested and ligated together prior to transcription this approach has been successfully used to recover clones of many coronaviruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev 8 murine hepatitis virus mhv 10 nl63 42 sars coronavirus 9 sars-like bat coronaviruses 43 and mers coronavirus 5 another common platform utilizes existing bac technology the coronavirus genome is introduced into a bac construct under the control of a cmv promoter this approach has been successfully used to recover clones of human viruses oc43 and mers coronavirus 316 both of these approaches yield productive infections and high titers of progeny virus a third approach involving a vaccinia vector platform has also been used successfully for the production of human 229e infectious clones 7 efforts to design a coronavirus vaccine have focused on a variety of approaches including development of inactivated virus live-attenuated virus and a variety of subunit vaccines one major focus of current coronavirus vaccine efforts is focusing on ways to create a live-attenuated vaccine strain which combines existing treatments with a less virulent and more stable virus platform during the sars epidemic patients showed little improvement when treated with ribavirin recent studies have shown that coronaviruses are resistant to ribavirin treatment due to the presence of a viral exonuclease nsp14 with proofreading activity 4445 additionally deletion of the exonuclease proofreading activity results in a hypermutation phenotype that appears genetically stable and induces protection in murine models 464748 the recent outbreak of mers-cov has triggered a demand for the development of a mers vaccine 49 several approaches are being explored including identifying effective neutralizing antibodies use of the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein as a component to induce immunity and direct changes to recombinant mers-cov 3505152 the availability of effective reverse genetics platforms for coronaviruses associated with high mortality viruses such as sars and mers coronaviruses and the potential for low cost for development and implementation provide promise for creating an effective vaccine platform  flaviviruses are small enveloped positive-strand rna viruses that infect a wide range of hosts flavivirus genomes are markedly smaller than coronaviruses at approximately 1012 kb in size and the transmission of most flaviviruses is dependent upon an arthropod vector hence their common name arboviruses flavivirus diseases range from asymptomatic to severe neurological disease such as encephalitis meningitis and myelitis 53 yellow fever virus yfv a deadly flavivirus associated with over 30000 deaths annually who was identified in 1901 by walter reed and was the first human viral pathogen ever discovered 545556 outbreaks and disease connected to flaviviruses have stressed the importance of developing reverse genetic platforms and efficacious vaccines similar to picornaviruses nearly all flavivirus reverse genetics platforms involve either in vitro transcription of full-length or ligated cdna fragments of the genome or use a bacterial artificial chromosome bac platform table 1 and are subsequently transfected or electroporated into competent cells reverse genetics platforms have been developed for a wide range of flaviviruses including yfv 5758 dengue types 14 5960616263646566 jev 67 kunjin virus 68 tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev 697071 murray valley encephalitis virus 72 langat virus 73 west nile virus wnv 674 and omsk hemorrhagic fever virus 75 advances in the recombinant flavivirus approaches have been instrumental in new vaccine design efforts  some of the first vaccine efforts were directed at generating inactivated or live-attenuated strains for vaccinations against flaviviruses in 1937 max theiler developed a safe yfv live-attenuated vaccine called 17d through the use of a serial passaged virus originally isolated from an african patient 76 the vaccine composition used today remains largely the same as that first developed over 70 years ago and provides protective immunity for over 30 years 777879 jev was first isolated and studied in the 1930s and an inactivated vaccine derived from a mouse brain was first developed in japan in 1954 5380 the current formulations of the jev vaccines include inactivated beijing-1 strain or liveattenuated strains which elicit greater immunogenicity and broader protection than the original nakayama strain 53 despite the success of vaccine development for yfv and jev unique challenges have been presented in developing vaccines to some well-known flaviviruses such as dengue virus and new emerging flaviviruses such as wnv  dengue virus is endemic to tropical and subtropical locations worldwide to date five distinct serotypes of dengue virus are known including a new serotype identified in 2013 5381 infection with one serotype increases the severity of disease upon a secondary infection with a different serotype 82 consequently any dengue virus vaccine must either provide protection to all extent serotypes to prevent priming for increased disease by a heterotypic infection or remove the immunogenic components of the virus that cause increased disease severity upon heterotypic infections efforts to develop stable chimeric platforms for the development of dengue virus vaccines have recently been focused on expressing dengue virus surface proteins in chimeric viruses with other more stable flaviviruses such as yfv 838485 one vaccine candidate is a tetravalent vaccine from sanofi pasteur which involves the formation of a chimeric yfv strain 17d virus containing the prme genes of each dengue serotype 85 this approach has also recently been adapted to develop similar vaccine candidates to the recently identified wnv 8586 despite several commercially available wnv vaccines for veterinary purposes there remains no approved wnv vaccine for humans the future licensure of dengue and wnv vaccines will likely continue to focus on development of liveattenuated or inactivated virus models of vaccination due to the high immunogenicity of flavivirus infections paramyxoviruses are enveloped negative-sense single-strand rna viruses which are responsible for a variety of human and animal diseases human paramyxoviruses have been identified which are responsible for diseases including measles mumps pneumonia and the common cold paramyxoviruses carry a single copy of their genome which is typically 15 to 19 kb in length like other negative-strand rna viruses paramyxoviruses must incorporate their replication machinery including the rdrp into the virion during assembly paramyxovirus reverse genetic systems employ very similar mechanisms first the full-length genome or antigenome and helper plasmids expressing nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins are cloned as cdna and are under transcriptional control by a promoter such as t7 rna polymerase the plasmids are co-transfected into permissive cell lines earlier reverse genetics systems utilized a co-infection approach with a vaccinia virus expressing t7 however most modern reverse genetics systems use a t7 cell line or transfect a t7 plasmid recently the first bac-based reverse genetics system for a negative-strand rna virus was developed for respiratory syncytial virus rsv 21 reverse genetics systems for many paramyxoviruses have been generated including measles virus 89 mumps virus 90 hendra virus 91 nipah virus 92 rsv 2193 despite the availability of reverse genetics systems development of paramyxovirus vaccines has been met with variable success  the first paramyxovirus vaccine was developed during the 1950s john enders was able to develop a cultivation system for measles virus and cultured an attenuated measles virus called the edmonston strain named after the child from which it was isolated the edmonston strain though initially underattenuated was later adapted and led to the successfully license of a measles vaccine in 1963 94 maurice hilleman was able to build on the success of the live-attenuated measles vaccine and cultured and adapted by passage in fertilized hens eggs a strain of mumps called jeryl lynn named after his daughter from whom it was isolated 95 hilleman was later instrumental in the development of the mmr vaccine combining live-attenuated strains of measles mumps rubella wistar ra 273 strain which was first licensed for use in 1971 96 the early success of the measles and mumps vaccines prompted renewed efforts to develop vaccines to other pathogenic rna viruses one of the greatest challenges to viral vaccine design remains the development of a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus rsv  respiratory syncytial virus rsv was first isolated in 1955 from a chimpanzee displaying upper respiratory illness 97 since its identification rsv has become recognized as the leading cause of infant mortality by a virus worldwide 9899 in the united states alone rsv upper and lower respiratory infections have led to over 100000 hospitalizations annually 9899100 despite a high clinical burden no licensed rsv vaccines are available and current treatments are cost prohibitive while only providing passive immunity by administration of prophylactic antibodies 101102103 the most susceptible population for rsv infection is young infants 9899100 consequently the ideal rsv vaccine must be immunogenic genetically stable and safe for vaccination in infants however an early tragic failure during the 1960s of a formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine has dampened efforts to develop and implement new vaccines 104105 to date the most clinically advanced rsv vaccine candidates have been live-attenuated viruses developed through virus passage and reconstitution by reverse genetics 106107108 one of the more promising of these candidates to date has been medi559 which includes many introduced mutations which render the virus temperature-sensitive and provides some level of protection 106107 however these candidates have not been able to achieve the level of protection and genetic stability necessary for implementation 109 ongoing studies continue to evaluate new targets for attenuation however successful development of an rsv vaccine will require finding the proper balance of attenuation and immunogenicity orthomyxoviruses are enveloped negative-sense rna viruses whose genomes consist of multiple linear segments and are approximately 12 to 15 kb in size similar to paramyxoviruses many orthomyxoviruses cause respiratory illnesses in humans most notable is influenza flu a key hallmark of orthoymyxovirus evolution is the reassortment of the virus genomes through co-infection of a cell in order to be transcriptionally active influenza viruses require a functionally active viral ribonucleoprotein complex rnp which consists of the viral genomic rna nucleoprotein np and the viral rdrp comprised of pb1 pb2 and pa proteins 110 the first reverse genetics approaches developed for orthomyxoviruses were generated for influenza a virus iav however these systems utilized helper viruses that had to be selected against to recover recombinants 111112 the first helper virus-free systems were developed around the turn of the millennium 113114 these first systems required the co-transfection of four or more plasmids under the control of a pol ii promoter as well as eight plasmids expressing the eight viral rna segments the number of plasmids cotransfected for recovery varied greatly depending upon the number of viral genomic segments and the organization of the helper protein constructs ranging from 10 which expressed two of the helper proteins on each of two plasmids using the pol ii promoter and an ires to as many as 17 113114115116117118 however recent advances in the reverse genetics platforms have reduced the number of total plasmids needed to 8 or less using a bidirectional expression system 1112 in this system a human pol i promoter coupled with either a murine poli terminator drives viral rna synthesis and a cmv pol ii promoter is responsible for viral mrna synthesis 11 this improved production of iav however generation of recombinant virus for vaccines is limited to a select number of mammalian cell lines such as african green monkey kidney epithelial cells vero or madin darby canine kidney mdck cells 119120 however these cell lines had limited transfectability and differences in pol i and pol ii compatibility have hindered the efficacy of these uni- and bidirectional approaches incorporation of species-specific polymerase promoters has provided improved efficacy of recovery in several of these cell lines 119120 a recent advancement has been the combination of up to 8 pol i driven iav genes on a single plasmid and up to 3 pol ii drive genes on an additional plasmid this approach improves the probability of a single cell receiving all necessary plasmids during recovery 121 the availability of applicable reverse genetics systems for studying and identifying the structure and function of influenza proteins has revolutionized influenza vaccination strategies  for many years the trivalent vaccine that is currently provided consisted of three separated strains 2 a strains and 1 b strain which were selected based on the who recommendations prior to the next flu season however these vaccines were made using either live-attenuated through cold-adaptation or inactivated virus grown in fertilized chicken eggs next generation vaccination strategies include tetravalent or quadrivalent vaccines which may be grown in animal cell cultures rather than chicken eggs or virus-like particles vlps in cultures of s frugiperda insect sf9 cells 122123124125126127128129 in 2013 the fda approved a seasonal influenza vaccine comprised of purified ha proteins prepared using a baculovirus-expression system 130 these recombinant vaccines were successfully used to vaccinate individuals between 18 and 49 years of age and represents a major step in influenza vaccine design and implementation because this system reduces production time compared to the conventional egg-based approach 131  a major frontier of synthetic biology is the development of new vaccines and therapeutics and the improvement of the implementation and efficacy of those already on the market one major complication to the successful implementation of vaccines currently is the limitations in time between vaccine design and production influenza viruses require seasonal vaccinations and determination of the proper formulations leaves little time for development and implementation new advances in reverse genetics technology are reducing the potential time of recovery and production from months to weeks for instance dormitzer et al have developed an improved platform approach and demonstrated that with current reverse genetics technology it is feasible to generate a recombinant influenza virus from new ha and na sequences within 5 days 132 as new emerging viruses continue to appear and pandemics continue to occur rapid approaches to recover and adapt viruses will be instrumental in the public health response development of common chimeric reverse genetic platforms for rapid cloning and expression of surface antigens from emergent pathogens will help increase the efficacy and timing of delivery during epidemic and pandemic outbreaks one key limitation to the development of effective live-attenuated vaccines is genetic stability rna viruses generally exhibit high mutation rates due to decreased fidelity of the rdrp yet recent studies have shown that codon-usage bias can be used to alter the translation and consequently replication of viruses several groups have shown that substituting non-preferred codons based on host cell codon usage bias a process referred to as codon-deoptimization into the genome of poliovirus resulted in reduction of plaque areas and virus yields 133134 by changing codons rather than amino acids the amount of viral protein may be modulated without impairment in its function more importantly the potential for reversion is greatly limited due to the sheer number of codon changes introduced into the coding sequence this approach represents a promising new avenue to develop attenuated but genetically stable vaccine platforms despite the presence of reverse genetics systems for many human pathogens not all have resulted in successful vaccine platforms advances in biotechnology and key discoveries have led to novel reverse genetic approaches which may be employed in new generation vaccines structural vaccinology or structure-based antigen design has become a common practice for optimizing antigens for display in vaccines 135 as mentioned previously rsv remains a key hurdle to reducing viral childhood morbidity since the discovery and implementation of palivizumab currently the only licensed prophalytic inhibitory measure to rsv infection considerable energy has been devoted to evaluating the antigenic sites of the rsv fusion f protein and optimizing f expression constructs for higher immunogenicity 105 current structural vaccinology efforts to evaluate the pre-fusion and post-fusion antigenic forms of rsv f protein have led to the induction and identification of potent neutralizing antibodies with higher neutralizing potencies than palivizumab 136137 the availability of new structures and sequences has made predictive structural modeling and structure-based antigen design viable options for renewed efforts at design of vaccines for which no current vaccines exist advances in biotechnology have shaped the field of virology as much as any other field of science the capacity to engineer reverse genetics platforms for the study and manipulation of rna virus genomes has revolutionized the field of vaccine design we have described here rna virus reverse genetic systems and past and current efforts to develop vaccines to provide immunity to several human rna virus pathogens the incorporation of new advances in reverse genetics technology adjuvants non-human models of infection and surveillance will continue to drive the development of next generation vaccines to pathogens for which we already have vaccination strategies as well as those that we currently do not ongoing changes in human demographics and accessibility to health care are likely to modify cost-benefit analyses and provoke allocation of new resources for scientific study and development of vaccines despite the ongoing evolution of vaccine design and implementation the hallmarks of an effective viral vaccine will remain the same high efficacy safety and stability  covid-19 pandemic a mobility-dependent seir model with undetected cases in italy europe and us nicola picchiotti monica salvioli elena zanardini francesco missale s    a  the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 emerged in china at the end of 2019 and has spread worldwide within few weeks reaching a pandemic status china and italy followed by other countries have implemented strict control measures including complete lockdown the effects of such measures and the optimal strategies to relax them are major public health concerns we introduce a seir compartmental model describing the covid-19 pandemic taking into account the region-specific fraction of undetected cases the effects of mobility restrictions fitting google covid-19 community mobility report data and the personal protective measures adopted as frequent hand washing or use of the model is experimentally validated with data of italian regions european countries and us obtaining fitting parameters in good agreement with previous literature the mean absolute percentage error analysis for forecasting accuracy judgement showed that our model was highly accurate in 12 regions 46 good in 7 27 and reasonable in 7 27 the estimation of the undetected cases allows to evaluate different post-lockdown scenarios which is crucial for public-health decision makers conclusions the proposed model calibrated and designed on measured or literature-based parameters was successfully applied in all scenarios analyzed and the estimation of the dynamic of the whole number of infectious individuals could help the planning of different strategies aimed at relaxing the lockdown measures picchiotti et al highlights  covid-19 pandemic size and evolution is highly dependent on both detected and undetected cases  undetected cases are estimable from lethality data and death records  a seir model for covid-19 pandemic calibrated on mobility data changing  different scenarios depending on when and how the lockdown measures are relaxed  italy was the first european country experiencing a substantial outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and consequently applying lockdown emergency measures to contain the spread of the epidemic similarly to the chinese strategy in particular as the number of infections was growing exponentially 1  the italian authorities decided to close all schools on march 5th 2020 and introduced community containment lockdown measures starting on march 9th spain france germany united kingdom uk and united states us are the countries with the highest number of infections and deaths all these countries adopted public health measures and most of them implemented a complete lockdown but such measures were introduced at different time points following local outbreaks and with different strengths 1  the aim of our work is to model the evolution of the covid-19 pandemic in different regions taking into account major confounders such as undetected cases related to the different case fatality ratio measured and taking into account background death data and different mobility changes as effect of public health measures assuming that isolation is successfully applied to the positive detected cases undetected and asymptomatic cases will represent the main source of infections in the near future potentially determining new outbreaks this poses a crucial challenge for public health decision makers namely to determine when and how to relax the control measures implemented so far taking into account the whole number of estimated infectious individuals and not only the tested cases our model provides an accurate estimation of the undetected and asymptomatic cases therefore allowing to predict future epidemic peaks and design the most effective way to relax the control measures in terms of timing and strength in term of mobility restrictions and adoption of personal protective behavior moreover it can be expanded and tailored when more and new region-specific data will become available we model the spread of the covid-19 pandemic in different geographical regions using a modified seir compartmental model 2  fitted using publicly available data from the 2019-ncov data repository by johns hopkins csse and from the italian official repository updated as of 24th april 3 in a classical seir model the population is divided into four classes susceptible exposed infected and recovered in our specific case illustrated in supplementary methods we added the classes of positive tested undetected infected and both for detected and undetected ones the two possible ending point healing and death  figure 1a  disease-specific parameters were derived from the recent literature including a mean incubation time  1  of 5 we compared available italian death records data from years 2015-2020 considering only february and march and assumed that the increase in deaths registered in 2020 until 28th march in each italian region is entirely related to the covid-19 pandemic even though only a fraction was confirmed as positive in particular we estimated that undetected covid-19 cases in italy represent 53 of the registered covid-19 deaths table 1  which is consistent with other scenarios for instance on 17th april 2020 the chinese government announced that in hubei province there are 1290 covid-19-related deaths occurred from the beginning of the pandemic which were not previously registered as covid-19 deaths and that represent about 40 of the officially registered deaths 9  this fact supports the use of the italian estimation for all analyzed countries therefore by combining the background death records data with the measured nave case fatality rates ncfrs up to 10th march ranging from 226 in germany to 1827 in lombardy italy to obtain an acfr of 14 ci95 12-17 8  it is possible to give a reasonable estimate of the proportion of undetected cases in different regions we introduced in the model the public health measures taking into account the effects of mobility changes as well as the potential effects of adopting a personal protective behavior like frequent hands washing and wearing a mask the former is modelled with a decreasing logistic function where the target plateau is the average mobility change reported by google covid-19 community mobility report in each geographical area over the last 7 available observations 11th-17th april and the shape is calibrated knowing the date of the implementation of public health measures social distancing advisement or school closures 1 and date of the maximum reduction of the mobility  figure 1b-d  a b c d the effect of the adoption of a personal protective behavior as frequent handwashing or masks wearing recommended worldwide 10  was derived from a metanalysis of studies performed in the context of sars epidemic 11  estimating an odds ratio or of the use of masks of 032 ci95 025-040 and an or of frequent handwashing of 045 ci95 036-057 for the risk of infection the models are fitted until 17th april leaving the last 7 observed days for the accuracy analysis of models predictions through mean absolute percentage error mape analysis 12  the model is deterministic thus the reasonable confidence intervals of fitted estimates were derived considering the ci95 of the acfr and the ci95 of personal protective measures ors derived from literature data 8 11 mathematical details of the model including the equations parameters calibration and fitting procedure are illustrated in the supplementary methods in the italian scenario the undetected proportion of cases ranges from 76 in lazio to 96 in sardinia being 93 for the whole italy table 1 figure 2a  epidemic curves obtained using the calibrated seir models are reported in figure 2b  the accuracy analysis of forecasting showed a median mape of 92 interquartile range iqr 36-145 range 09-348 table 1  the forecasting procedure permits an estimate on 24th april of the whole fraction of infected population including undetected cases ranging from 04 ci 03-05 for campania to 136 ci 134-139 for lombardy being  5 to 40-fold higher than positive tested cases as shown in table 1 and in heatmaps in figure 2a  this is coherent with recent literature results estimating the covid-19 prevalence until 7th april ranging from 035 to 112 across different italian regions 13  in the international context the number of supposed undetected cases ranges from 60 in germany to 92 in uk the application of the seir models tested in the whole italy france germany uk spain and us was satisfactory permitting also to show the trajectories of overall cases including undetected ones  figure 3a  analyzing the forecasting

through the next generation matrix method 14  the contribution of positive detected cases or undetected ones for the generation of secondary cases is weighted to obtain the overall reproductive number

show how the infection dynamics depend on the level of target mobility that is restored compared to the baseline and on the adoption of personal protective measures these two factors can make the difference between a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed and manageable one  figure 3b  since its first discovery as a new human virus on january 8th in wuhan china the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread worldwide determining the covid-19 pandemic that up to 6th may 2020 has caused over 3 588 773 confirmed cases and 245 503 death 16  the main public health issue regarding covid-19 disease is that 5 to 10 of the patients need intensive care recovery with artificial ventilation for onset of pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards as a consequence the number of intensive care beds which is often limited can become insufficient 17  despite the proven effectiveness of lockdown measures as shown in the chinese epidemic the challenge is now to assess their efficacy and to plan strategies to progressively relax them 18 19  mathematical models can help to determine the trajectories of the pandemic considering the confirmed cases and estimating the undetected ones in particular the sir or seir compartmental models have the advantage of providing useful insights for health care decision makers and of being easily manageable from a mathematical point of view 2 20  moreover if adequately calibrated with good literature-based parameters the simplicity of these models can avoid overfitting results 2  the supposed proportion of undetected cases is reported to be highly variable its estimation from case fatality rates was already proposed 1  but its integration with background death records data can further improve this estimate in the available published literature searching pubmed between dec 1st 2019 and april 19th 2020 we found several papers modelling the covid-19 pandemic using seir models most of them studying the evolution of the epidemic in wuhan or hubei or in single geographical context and proposing different scenarios depending on different transmission rates however only few of them take into account a measurable effect of public health intervention eg mobility changes 21  the work by gatto et al 21 is of major interest as they apply a modified seir model sepia using data of geo-located smartphone users to estimate the effect of lockdown intervention measures on the italian epidemic evolution 22  our results in the italian case-study report the cumulative number of overall affected cases as of march 25th and march 28th equal to 146106 ci to the best of our knowledge our is the first seir compartmental model taking into account the mobility

personal protective measures hand washing an masks wearing derived from literature estimates 11  fitting the recovery reporting time after the isolation of positive tested cases permitted to depict wide differences among countries iqr 36-95 days but also in-between italian regions iqr 38-99 days of note the fitted value of 10000 days for uk is the consequence of the interruption of disclosing publicly recovery data since the beginning of april 2020 recoverys reporting time heterogeneity is of main interest as the removal time of recovered individuals is expected to influence the shape of the epidemic curves of active cases before and after relaxing the lockdown measures furthermore as shown in the hubei case-study  figure 3b  the outputs of our model in term infectious groups undetected or not already confirmed cases can be even though specific and quantitative predictions from a mathematical model need to be taken with caution some key messages can be derived as the estimation and the evolution of complex phenomena that are hardly imaginable by the common sense for instance the hidden dynamic of undetected cases parallel to the dynamic of detected ones 23  despite having some limitations not considering spatial-temporal dynamics and stochastic features the main advantage of our system is its easy application that can be even improved by further updating mobility information nowadays publicly available and acquiring region-specific background death records data none none declared because this study involved the use of publicly available aggregate data approval by a research ethics board was not required all data used in this manuscript are publicly available covid-19 epidemiological data for italy are available at httpsgithubcompcm-dpccovid-19 and

community mobility report are available at httpswwwgooglecomcovid19mobility downloaded on 23rd april 2020 herein we introduce the mathematical details of the epidemiological model presented in this study it is a modified version of the well-known seir susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered compartmental model accounting both for specific features of the covid-19 infection and for the impact of public health protective measures on the dynamic of the transmission rate the population is divided into nine classes representing the possible states of the individual in relation to the diseases  susceptible s it is the class containing individuals that can potentially contract the disease  exposed e includes individuals that have been exposed to disease infected but are not yet capable of transmission not yet infectious  infected i includes individuals that are both infected and infectious  positive tested p contains individuals recognized as positive by the health national system and assumed to be well isolated either hospitalized or quarantined and not infectious anymore  recovered r includes subjects healed and whose recovery is notified by the health system  dead d  hidden infected   includes subjects affected by the disease either asymptomatic or symptomatic but not officially tested and registered as infected by the health national system  hidden recovered   includes individuals recovered form the disease but previously not registered as positive by the health national system  hidden dead   includes individuals not officially registered by the health national system who were infected and died the mathematical model is described by the following set of nine ordinary differential equations odes representing the time rates of change of the introduced variables in a population of size  in the equations above the number of susceptible individuals   decreases over time due to contacts with the infectious population    the force of the infection is driven by the transmission rate parameter defined as the probability of disease transmission in a single contact times the average number of contacts per unit time per personall the other parameters represent the rates at which individuals pass from a compartment to the subsequent one they can be seen as the inverse of the number of days on average spent in the former class specifically for an exposed individual is the rate of change from the class to either the infected   or the hidden infected   ones 1 is the rate of change from the infected class to the class the parameter 2 and represent respectively the recovery rate of a hidden infected or the recoverys notification rate by the health system of a positive tested subject similarly and are the mortality rates as said before the number of days spent in each class is given by the inverse of the corresponding rate the incubation period  1  the infectious period of visible infected 1  1 1  the average diagnosis time for an exposed individual to being positive tested 2  1 2 and the average dead period of both positive tested  1 and hidden infectious   1  the recovery periods of the hidden infectious is given by   1  we stress the fact that the recovery period of the visible infected individual is given by  1  2 1  as regards the other parameters and represents the probability for an individual respectively in or to end in the dead class or  whereas the parameter  is the fraction of that becomes hidden infectious  in figure 1a of the main text we report the compartmental diagram illustrating the model as well as the introduced parameters the odes system is supplemented by the initial conditions note that the variables   and are cumulative and that the system has the mass conservation property since the total population is constant over time in our model the average number of contacts is described by considering an initial constant value 0 reduced over time by a decreasing function   with 0  1 similarly for the probability of transmission we have the modelling of the mobility time dependent part   is given by a decreasing logistic function with a plateau defined as where the normalization constant granting 0  1 is in eq10 the parameter is the abscissa of the inflection point and the parameter is related to the first derivative calculated in that point that is the steepness of the function the parameter is the plateau of the function the parameter is calibrated using the google covid-19 community mobility report data by computing the average mobility changes for the period 11th-17th april for the four categories retail and recreation grocery and pharmacy transit stations and workplaces mobility as regards the second effect of personal protective measures we do not assume an explicit behaviors of the   function instead we incorporated its effect as a reduction of the plateau  the consequent transformation of the mobility decreasing function can be described by considering the aggregate product of both the time dependent terms as note that despite this transformation the second derivative is invariant and the abscissa of the inflection point is still the same of   in order to fit the function with the actual data we note that the derivative in the inflection point is equal to the initial date of the transition can be written as a function of and  and similarly the final date of the transition is in figure 1b  the parameter 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases arising from a typical primary case in an entirely susceptible population we exploit the next generation matrix method van den driessche   a comparison study of realtime fatality rates severe acute respiratory syndrome in hong kong singapore taiwan toronto and beijing china paul yip s k lam f eric lau h puihing chau kenneth tsang w anne chao   severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a highly contagious and severe atypical pneumonia which is caused by a new coronavirus and is predominantly transmitted by droplets and contact with contaminated fomites tsang ho ooi et al 2003 rota et al 2003 seto et al 2003 riley et al 2003 sars has rapidly spread worldwide and there were in total 8098 reported cases with 774 fatalities at july 31st 2003 world health organization 2003a an ongoing controversial topic is the estimation of the fatality rate of sars the usual definition of the fatality rate that has been adopted by the world health organization who is the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of infected people in the course of the epidemic world health organization 2003b this is often called the case fatality rate and is assumed to be a constant while the outbreak was on going and there were patients still in hospitals over the course of the epidemic the who estimate assumed implicitly that all remaining sars inpatients would eventually recover it therefore led to an underestimation of the true case fatality rate for example in the midst of the sars outbreak at april 15th 2003 the fatality rate in hong kong was 45 according to the who estimate but it hit a record high of 170 at the end of the epidemic furthermore the who estimate cannot reflect the changing fatality rate over the course of the epidemic in a timely manner owing to the use of cumulative data in the calculation the who estimates of the fatality rates of hong kong singapore taiwan beijing and toronto were 170 139 107 65 and 158 at july 31st 2003 respectively hong kong appeared to have the highest fatality rate 
donnelly et al 2003 were the first to apply a survival analysis framework to analyse the sars data and to estimate the time delay distributions of the times since infection to onset onset to admission admission to death and admission to discharge they assumed a fixed probability  the case fatality rate and 1 for the respective outcomes of death and recovery for each inpatient on admission during the whole course of the epidemic their approach projected an estimate of the case fatality rate and the estimate depends on whether the age of the patient is over 60 years or not their formulation can also be easily extended to a mixture of regression or threshold models to incorporate exogenous variables in this setting the constant case fatality rate is often interpreted as a measure of the severity or virulence of an infectious disease for a completely new disease like sars it would be worthwhile and informative to inves tigate how the rate of death given that a patient either dies or recovers varies with time as clinical experience on diagnosis and management improve over time when modelling this rate there is no need to model the infectious process as our interest is in measuring the fatality that is inflicted by the epidemic also the duration of hospitalization of individual patients is not taken into account since the initiation of hospitalization of an sars patient is dependent on several factors including the very early screening of hospital staff who are exposed leading to detection and hospitalization of very early and asymptomatic disease which is in contrast with the reluctance of some cases to seek medical attention thereby delaying their hospitalization in the process in this paper we call this rate the realtime fatality rate the rapid accumula tion of experience and knowledge on the diagnosis investigation and management along with different age groups being affected at different times compounded by differences in viral loads and other confounding factors do not permit the assumption of a constant rate throughout the period of the outbreak  to monitor the fatality of an emerging epidemic an estimator for such a timespecific rate at the population level should be used to assess the efficacy of treatment in realtime especially when the disease is rapidly evolving for instance there is also considerable controversy on the treatment of sars wenzel and edmond 2003 the efficacy of ribavirin and corticosteroids which were commonly used in hong kong for an empirical treatment of sars is not proven by controlled trial studies that were impossible to organize during the initial outbreak in the absence of large scale clinical trials to assess the efficacy of various treatments investigators are interested in the estimation of the realtime fatality rate over the course of the epidemic with a broad assessment of the effect of other factors including variation in clinical management and other exogenous including unidentified or unspecified factors over the course of the outbreak in this paper a counting process in a competing risk setup is used to model the transitions from inpatient to death and from inpatient to recovery andersen et al 1993 yip and lam 1992 1993 the inpatients are subject to death or recovery or to remain in the hospital over the course of the epidemic here the timescale of interest is the calendar time rather than the usual time to event from admission in standard survival analysis studies as in donnelly et al 2003 a new measure termed the realtime fatality rate is proposed in this paper and is defined as the probability of death conditioned on a transition to death or recovery at time t this formulation can therefore model the fatality rate in realtime for the infected community in a macro perspective since rate estimates from survival models are usually estimated as step functions a kernel method is used to smooth the estimates of the transition rates for recovery and death at time t and for the realtime fatality rate this realtime fatality rate is also useful in providing information on the efficacy of certain treatments and on the management of the disease during the outbreak of the disease the approximate pointwise confidence limits of the respective transition and the realtime fatality rates are readily available the method is applied to the sars data from the regions affected namely hong kong singapore toronto taiwan and beijing the daily data on admission discharge and death for all sars patients in hong kong singapore taiwan beijing and toronto were obtained from the web sites of the respective government agencies and authorities hong kong httpwwwinfogovhkinfosarscnewshtm singapore httpappmohgovsgsarsnewsupdatesasp taiwan httpsarsdohgovtwnews beijing httpwwwmohgovcnzhglyqfbindexhtm toronto httpwwwhc-scgccapphb-dgspspsars-sraseu-aeindexhtml all patients with probable sars were diagnosed according to the criteria that were established by the who world health organization 2003b briefly patients with probable sars presented with high fever temperature above 38c coughing or breathing difficulty contact history with sars patients and pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia on chest radiographs or high resolution computed tomography of the thorax that could not be explained by an alternative diagnosis tsang mok wong and ooi 2003 the criteria from the who and centers for disease control and prevention 2003 do not require microbiological confirmation although most patients with sars in hong kong have positive serological evidence of sars coronavirus infection ie a significant rise in immunoglobulin g after a period of 21 days peiris et al 2003 for each inpatient the final outcome must be either death or recovery the primary target of most medical treatments and policies for lethal epidemics such as sars is to lower the fatality rate during the outbreak of the epidemic ie to lower the force of death relative to recovery rather than necessarily to shorten the period of hospitalization hence a measure of treatment efficacy should be time sensitive calendar time but not chronological time and focus on their effects on death and recovery by considering these two outcomes as competing risks as in yip and lam 1992 we can obtain a realtime fatality rate which serves well for treatment or policy evaluation during the epidemic the two risks which are not necessarily independent are assumed to operate simultaneously on the inpatients since the times of the outbreak in sarsaffected areas are different we have different time origins different calendar times for different regions depending on the time of onset of the sars epidemic and the availability of the data with all areas followed longitudinally up to june 30th 2003 the method proposed makes use of the information only on the cumulative number of deaths cumulative number of discharges and sars patients who are still in hospital on day t for the hong kong region t0 for march 1st 2003 t1 for march 2nd 2003 and so on denoted by n
1tn
2t and it respectively suppose that n
1t and n
2t are counting processes with intensity processes or causespecific instantaneous transition rates for a transition to death and to recovery on the tth day denoted by 
1t and 
2t respectively that satisfy the multiplicative intensity model

are zeromean martingales with respect to the increasing family of fields f
tt0 on the basis of standard martingale theories the cumulative causespecific transition rates can be estimated easily by the usual nelsonaalen estimator a smoothed version of the causespecific transition rates can be estimated by the ramlauhansen 1983 estimator given by

where t
i1t
i2 denote the ordered exit times due to cause i b is the window width of a kernel function which determines the degree of smoothing and b is a kernel function one frequently used kernel function is the epanechnikov kernel function

 details on the estimation of 
1t and 
2t can be found in yip and lam 1992 1993 since the time unit is days there were situations where several people recovered or died on the same day for simplicity we assume that all the deaths occurred before the discharges on each day this assumption has very little effect on the estimates it should be noted that only those exit times t
il for which tbt
iltb would contribute to the estimation of 
itwhereas the information on those days that are outside the range would have no contribution under some mild regularity conditions estimator 1 suitably normalized is distributed according to a normal distribution asymptotically see andersen et al 1993 pages 241243 and the variance of the estimator is consistently estimated by

 hence approximate 1001 pointwise confidence limits can be constructed for the 
i easily the choice of the bandwidth b for the kernel function in equation 1 leads to a tradeoff between the variance and bias of
 the optimal bandwidth for  can be obtained by minimizing the integrated meansquare error andersen et al 1993 in theory however a subjective value of b by visually examining the fitted  would be sufficient for our purpose after many trials of different bandwidths window widths of 5 7 6 3 and 12 days were chosen for hong kong singapore taiwan beijing and toronto respectively depending on the volatility and sparseness of the data a natural estimator for the ratio of the transition rates t
2t
1t was given by

 by the martingale theories it can be shown that the estimates of the cumulative intensities  for i12 are nearly orthogonal and hence the covariance is 0 the delta method can be used to estimate the variance of

 finally we propose a new measure of the fatality rate t defined as the probability of death conditioned on a transition to death or recovery at time t mathematically

 a natural estimator for t is thus

and again using the delta method the variance estimator for

 approximate 1001 confidence limits for t can also be obtained in a similar manner to that for t also it is important to note that as mentioned earlier there is no need to model the complex hospitalization process iu in our formulation as far as the estimation of the realtime fatality rate is concerned for the entire hong kong region up to july 31st 2003 altogether 1755 cases were hospitalized of these 1456 and 299 cases were discharged and died from sars respectively figs 1a and 1b depict the estimates of 
1t and 
2t respectively together with the associated 95 confidence bands both transition rates increased with time since the beginning of the epidemic the estimated intensity of transition to death
 peaked around march 20th decreased and then increased again around may 15th 2003 the estimated intensity of recovery
 peaked around april 1st where most of the sars patients who were medical health workers from a regional hospital prince of wales hospital were discharged and another two peaks were also found around the end of april and on may 19th fig 1c depicts the ratio estimate of the two rates
 while fig 1d shows the plot of the estimated realtime fatality rate at time t
 over the course of the epidemic together with the who estimate the who methodology estimated the case fatality rates of sars in hong kong at march 30th april 15th and may 25th 2003 as 25 99 and 158 respectively and started to stabilize thereafter with a final estimate of 17 at june 30th in contrast the realtime fatality rate was chaotically high at the beginning of the outbreak since few patients were discharged in the early stages of the outbreak the realtime fatality rate seemed to have stabilized from early april fluctuating between 15 and 20 similar figures for the estimated realtime fatality rates with different origins for singapore taiwan beijing and toronto are given in fig 2
 the number of sars cases in singapore was smaller than that of hong kong probably because of the confinement of outbreaks within hospitals and the lack of major community outbreaks such as that occurring in amoy gardens in hong kong there were altogether 238 cases with 33 deaths with a whoestimated case fatality rate of 139 fig 2a shows that the realtime fatality rate appeared to stabilize approximately 4 weeks after the outbreak which was similar to what happened in hong kong the fatality rates fluctuated between 15 and 19 after the middle of april data from taiwan became available from april 4th 2003 altogether 37 deaths were found out of the 346 cases with a who case fatality rate of 107 however the timevarying rate suggested an unusually high rate in the early part of the outbreak which subsequently improved most of the major outbreaks were found within hospitals in taiwan for toronto the data were available from march 18th 2003 with a total of 39 deaths from 247 infected cases giving a who case fatality rate of 158 sars had made a comeback in the community httpwwwhc-scgccapphb-dgspspsars-sraseu-aeindexhtml the most recent date of onset of illness and isolation among probable cases was june 12th most of the sars cases in canada were found in toronto for beijing a special hospital was built within two weeks to treat the sars patients in may 2003 the government implemented very effective measures to prevent infection in the community and in hospital including the removal of the minister of health and the mayor of beijing city who failed to deal with the epidemic control a very high level working group was set up and headed by a vicepremier the realtime fatality rate was estimated to be high in the early stage of the epidemic and continuously improved over the course of the epidemic such that the rate was less than 5 by june 10th however the who case fatality rate was much higher than this june estimate of the timevarying rate since the former was very much affected by the early data an estimation of the fatality rate in the situation of an emerging outbreak or epidemic is never straightforward this is particularly true for sars when clinicians all over the world had to deal with this highly contagious and frightening pneumonic illness with no idea of its aetiology pathogenesis clinical features management issues or prognosis other than anecdotal information from colleagues from mainland china tsang and lam 2003 lee et al 2003 the original estimate of the fatality rate for sars was only about 45 by both the who and the hong kong health authority department of health of hong kong government 2003 even as late as the beginning of april 2003 this was later adjusted to about 10 in may 2003 this underestimation of the fatality rate from sars must have undoubtedly affected the health care planning measures that were taken to contain sars and thus the outcome of the sars outbreak at the community level our comparison of the estimated realtime fatality rates among the sarsaffected areas shows that the sars fatality rate appears to be changing with time in all regions besides beijing the realtime fatality rates of all other areas seem to fluctuate around 1220 the constant fatality assumption which was adopted by donnelly et al 2003 does not reflect the situation at the population level indeed the approach of donnelly et al 2003 can be extended easily to regression models set up to allow for differences in the diagnosis and management of patients by allowing the time constant case fatality rate to depend on relevant possibly timevarying explanatory variables however a timevarying fatality rate at a population level is always helpful and meaningful to medical researchers in addition this changing fatality pattern is not reflected by the definition of case fatality rate that has been adopted by the who that derives from the ratio of cumulative deaths to the total number of cases diagnosed any variation in clinical outcome measures eg as a result of improved treatment modalities would not be depicted by such a definition by using the actual calendar timescale rather than duration of hospitalization the method proposed provides a visual assessment of the effect of other factors including variation in clinical management and other exogenous including unidentified factors over the course of the outbreak a stable estimate of the fatality rate could reflect a more mature approach to the diagnosis and treatment of sars although the efficacy of using high dose corticosteroid and ribavirin to deal with the lung parenchymal inflammation and coronavirus itself are largely controversial booth et al 2003 wenzel and edmond 2003 cyranoski 2003 the constant case fatality assumption is more suitable for some wellknown infectious diseases such as rabies or smallpox because the aetiology pathogenesis and treatment have been well studied with a standard treatment protocol it is recommended that the realtime fatality rate be investigated at the outbreak of an emerging epidemic it can serve as an indicator of the change in the fatality rate over time and can provide information on the effectiveness of the policy and treatment that are adopted our data show that sars fatality rates among hong kong singapore and toronto were similar whereas beijing appeared to have a lower rate after the first month of the epidemic in the absence of data from controlled clinical trials for the treatment of sars it would be interesting to speculate whether the timevarying fatality rates that are calculated by our model could be related to the different clinical treatment protocols that were used by these areas for instance the use of ribavirin was essentially forbidden in canada by late april 2003 whereas it has consistently been the standard empirical practice in hong kong the use of continuous positive airway pressure delivered by nasal masks to patients with hypoxia has been partly attributed as a cause of the low case fatality and low intensive care unit admission in mainland china personal communication from professor n s zhong of guangdong the use of traditional chinese medicine has also been claimed to be the cause of low case fatalities in beijing and glycyrrhizin an active component of liquorice roots has been shown to inhibit the replication of sarsassociated coronavirus cinatl et al 2003 the singaporian practice of using ribavirin and corticosteroid in the treatment of sars is not uniform and the standard protocol that is practised in taiwan has not been fully published twu et al 2003 hsu et al 2003 although these differences in clinical practices could contribute to a difference in case fatalities it should be cautioned that they do not necessarily equate to conclusions that are drawn from controlled clinical trials not withstanding these limitations especially acknowledging the insensitivity of the case fatality rate as a clinical outcome and the possible discrepancy in the diagnostic stringency it is possible that ribivarin treatment could have no effects in the clinical outcome of sars patients there is increasing concern about emerging infections all over the world and sars is only an example of how ignorant we are in dealing with the statisticalepidemiological and clinical management of this condition our model of using the realtime fatality rate should allow epidemiologists to monitor not only sars but also other emerging infections and conditions in the future corrigendum for this article in journal

half of patients and nearly a quarter of those patients required acute dialysis aki was independently associated with higher mortality many survivors 44 did not recover kidney function by hospital discharge and of all patients with aki only 30 survived and recovered kidney function we also trained and tested a machine learning algorithm to predict aki requiring dialysis with good performance while the current covid-19 pandemic is caused by a coronavirus like the sars-cov-2 outbreak in 2005 the reported incidence of aki associated with covid-19 disease appears to be substantially higher10 the incidence of aki in this study is higher than what has been reported in china and italy and similar to the incidence in another new york city healthcare system northwell11 there are several key differences in the mshs cohort including higher proportions of patients with comorbidities of hypertension diabetes and ckd which are risk factors for developing aki2 in our analysis there was no association between hypertension diabetes with several aki but ckd was independently associated with severe aki as others have reported patients who were admitted to the icu had a higher incidence of aki likely reflective of more severe disease currently the exact mechanisms of aki due to covid-19 are unclear a postmortem case series reported by su et al found significant acute tubular injury in all their patients1 however in another case series in patients with normal creatinine urinalysis abnormalities hematuria proteinuria and leukocyturia were common and unexpected finding in acute tubular necrosis12 given the high incidence of aki and lack of full recovery on discharge identification of potential mechanisms of covid-19 related aki would allow for potential interventions to reduce this devastating complication this study is the first study in the united states to report the persistence of kidney dysfunction lack of recovery in survivors of covid-associated aki over 40 of patients with aki in the setting of covid-19 did not recover kidney function back to baseline given the overall severity of aki as evidenced clinically high peak creatinine need for dialysis as well as the knowledge that many patients with covid-19 have extensive acute tubular injury on tissue examination as well as microthrombi along with a high prevalence of proteinuria it is not surprising that recovery from aki was incomplete in most patients1 a study in a chinese cohort reports similar findings with less than half of patients fully recovering kidney function13 it remains to be seen

follow-up and further investigation using a small set of features derived early in the hospital admission we were able to train a ml classifier to predict the need for aki requiring dialysis with good performance several features found to have a big effect on model performance included creatinine age and potassium additional features such as lymphocyte percentage were found to have more of an impact on the ml classifier than comorbidities such as hypertension this likely reflects the association of lymphocyte percentage and disease severity as has been previously documented in covid-19 disease or due to the loss of the protective effects of lymphocytes2021 pending additional study of the utility of the ml model this could be used for resource allocation and planning to prevent shortages of essential supplies our study should be interpreted in light of the following limitations over half of patients did not have a baseline creatinine values however we used mdrd imputation as suggested by kdigo guidelines and the incidence was nearly identical for those with known baseline serum creatinine vs those that we imputed because of missing serum creatinine prior to admission7 recovery was assessed at time of discharge which may not reflect patients new baseline kidney function as the covid-19 pandemic is still evolving few long term follow up lab test have been performed we did not have sufficient data on inflammatory makers eg interleukin 6 ferritin and fibrinogen in a large proportion of patients since they were not routinely checked early in the pandemic and a majority of patients did not have these values 22 additionally urinalysis was also missing in the majority of patients and we did not include in the analysis although further studies could benefit from characterizing the urinalysis profile of covid-19 associated aki lastly baseline medications of interest including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers statins and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not included in conclusion in a diverse cohort of patients with hospitalized with covid-19 in nyc we described a very high incidence of aki severe aki requiring dialysis and risk of death associated with aki we identified several predictors associated severe aki and found that half of patients did not recover kidney function at time of discharge lastly we developed a ml classifier that had good performance for the prediction of aki requiring dialysis the results of this study may be useful to other centers for resource planning during the

the eurozone claudius grbner philipp heimberger jakob kapeller   the coronavirus and the resulting lockdowns and economic restrictions are severely testing the structural resilience of european economies on the domestic level the imposed restrictions tend to hit economically weaker households and firms harder causing large-scale economic hardship that might fuel public resistance against economic restrictions based on public health concerns hence social divisions may undermine the resilience of european societies in terms of public health on the level of domestic economies likewise preliminary evidence on the european level suggests that economically weaker nations within the eurozone are hit harder by the corona crisis which may have severe repercussions for the eurozone as a whole while this article focuses on the latter aspectby asking how the corona crisis may contribute to the amplification of economic polarisation within the eurozonea common observation worth spelling out in both the domestic as well as in the european context is that existing social divisions limit the collective resilience of societies in public health terms in both contexts weaker actors are not only hit harder but have also fewer resources and leeway to cope with the immediate consequences of the crisis for the case of the eurozone the present article points out that because of the polarisation processes that started well before the corona pandemic both the extent of existing vulnerabilities as well as the policy space to counter the crisis differ considerably across eurozone member countries as a consequence the economic impacts are likely to be asymmetric and will in the absence of coordinated policy responses accelerate existing polarisation processes between an economically more well-off northern and a struggling southern eurozone1 the enormous challenge of economic recovery after the corona health crisis will be most pressing in the southern parts of the eurozone which consists of greece italy portugal and spain in these southern countries the crisis is forecast to reduce gdp growth rates more than in the northern eurozone countries comprising austria belgium finland germany and the netherlands see panel a of fig 1 since france often takes an intermediate position it is reported separately furthermore unemployment rates in southern countries have not only reached much higher levels in pre-corona times as compared to the northern eurozone they also seem to be more strongly affected by the advent of the corona crisis according to the most recent macroeconomic forecasts2 southern countries will suffer a relatively more pronounced increase in unemployment due to the economic downturn aggravating the already existing differences in the eurozone see panel b of fig 1 thus recovery needs differ considerable across regions in northern and southern parts of the eurozone european commission 2020a at the same time southern eurozone countriesabove all italy and greecehave entered into the corona crisis with high levels of public debt recent forecasts suggest that increases in fiscal deficits in the southern periphery will be particularly severe due to increasing government spending and decreasing tax revenues and public-debt-to-gdp ratioswhich are quantitatively affected by both increasing fiscal deficits as well as decreasing gdpwill rise strongly see panels c and d of fig 1 furthermore government revenues are expected to decline more in southern eurozone countries against the background of bigger losses in economic activity than in northern eurozone countries at the same time government spending is forecast to increase more in the northern eurozone countries reflecting a stronger response by automatic stabilizers as well as bigger discretionary efforts to counteract the corona crisis see fig 2 against this background there is a risk thatunder current institutional conditionsitaly and other southern eurozone countries will be able to finance only the most urgent measures while northern eurozone countries with a better starting positionespecially germany austria or the netherlandshave more fiscal space to support a rapid recovery once the economy is jump-started in this view the main constraints that prohibit a quicker recovery of southern countries arise from the current institutional arrangements under which fiscal space is typically correlated with macroeconomic performance heimberger and kapeller 20173 available data already point to such asymmetric fiscal responses at the national level in particular the immediate increase in fiscal spending in germany in the form of additional government spending on medical equipment short-time work subsidies for small and medium-sized enterprises etc amounts to more than 10 of economic output in 2020 compared with only 09 for italy 11 in spain 25 in portugal and 11 in greece but also the indirect fiscal responsethe deferral of taxes and social security contributions as well as other liquidity provisions and loan guaranteeslags behind germany in all southern countries except italy see fig 3 based on anderson et al 2020 while the numbers shown in fig 3 are influenced by a series of qualitatively different factorsincluding the impact of the pandemic and the state of the public health systemsthey also reflect differences in fiscal space across countries especially in the context of direct spending undertaken by governments this observation suggests that existing differentials in economic performance are indeed aggravated through the corona pandemic and that the competitiveness as well as the standard of living in the southern countries is likely to deteriorate further relative to other parts of the eurozone this article discusses these uneven macroeconomic consequences and economic policy responses against the background of an analysis of longer-term macroeconomic divergence in the eurozone previous research has shown that the underlying processes are path-dependent and relate not only to the divergence of major macroeconomic indicators but also to the polarisation of production structures between eurozone member countries and the associated development of divergent export-led and private-debt-led growth models simonazzi 2013 botta 2014 storm and naastepad 2015 celi et al 2018 grbner et al 2020b the present paper also highlights that increased macroeconomic polarisation in pre-corona years has fuelled political polarisation which has become visible in recent corona policy debates concerning the appropriate response to the macroeconomic consequences of the covid-19 pandemic countries such as italy and spain have immediately pushed for a stronger common european fiscal response only to find their more ambitious proposals about european burden-sharing of the crisis costs turned down by northern eurozone countries a more nuanced discussion about the potential for a pan-european recovery initiative only started with a considerably time lag promoted by a change in the political stance of the german government it will be argued below however thatin the absence of coordinated policy interventionsthe process of economic divergence occurring in the eurozone must be expected to accelerate further after the lockdown such a process would put the eurozone as a whole at risk with an eye to preventing the common currency area from falling part we will discuss some elements of coordinated fiscal and industrial policy action that could contribute to countering economic polarisation in the context of the corona crisis such policies could also be designed in a way that is consistent with a longer-term orientation towards achieving social and environmental sustainability the gap in per capita incomes between northern and southern eurozone countries has widened considerably since the birth of the euro about twenty years ago see fig 4a particularly the 10 years before the corona crisis have been characterised by a persistent divergence in terms of living standards of large parts of the eurozone which can be traced back to the co-existence of distinct growth models within the emu southern european countries mainly followed debt-led growth models which came with increasing private-sector indebtedness linked to the accumulation of current account deficits eg storm and naastepad 2016 at the same time northern countries mainly followed export-led growth models which came with current account surpluses and a stronger reliance on foreign trade when the financial crisis and the subsequent euro crisis hit the fragility of these imbalances built up in pre-crisis times laid bare the underlying reality of macroeconomic divergence grbner et al 2020b essential factors for explaining the long-term divergence of eurozone countries are to be found in the unequal regulatory conditions in the context of the european race for the best location for example in the areas of the labour market tax and corporate law or financial market regulation see kapeller et al 2019 as well as in the different technological capabilities across eu countries grbner et al 2019 2020b technological capabilities serve as an important driver of long-term economic development and there exists a strong positive relationship between the level of economic complexity used as a proxy for technological capabilities see hidalgo and hausmann 2009 and gdp per capita levels see fig 4b the problem in the decades running up to the corona crisis has been that the accumulation of these technological capabilities is a highly path-dependent process in the absence of coordinated policy measures existing differentials in technological capabilities will be self-reinforcing over time particularly within the eurozone where traditional compensation mechanisms for individual member countries are either not available currency devaluations or severely restricted fiscal and monetary policy due to existing institutional arrangements technological capabilities are also relevant when it comes to explaining the emergence of the unsustainable co-existence of export-driven and debt-driven growth models in the emu countries in the north were better equipped to follow an export-led growth model precisely because their economies have accumulated a sufficient amount of the technological capabilities necessary to compete successfully on international markets where technological sophistication is more important than price competitiveness storm and naastepad 2015 dosi et al 2015 grbner et al 2020b furthermore northern euro countriesmost of all germanywere able to strive over recent decades not despite but also because of the rise of asian economies such as china for firms that have focused on the production of technologically complex products the rise of asian countries came with additional export opportunities to asian partners who were keen to acquire more complex products and capital goods technological sophistication of firms in northern eurozone countries represented a unique competitive advantage in the global economy that remains relevant until today the emergence of these different growth models also had a feedback effect on the further development of production structures while germany and other northern countries have expanded their cumulative advantage in high-tech manufacturing over the past 2 decades southern european countries have increasingly been locked into lower-tech and non-tradable activities eg simonazzi 2013 botta 2014 as a consequence northern firms often do not directly compete with spanish portuguese greek or even most italian firms instead they are price-setters due to their strong market standing which is generated by a high degree of technological sophistication in contrast firms located on the southern periphery eg greece and portugal are more often confined to the role of price-takers as they compete with low-cost asian producers straca 2013 as a consequence they were much less able to base their competitiveness on technological capabilities while competing in terms of low wages or reduced environmental or labour protections would also be economically infeasible and politically destructive given the current levels of wages and regulations in europe in summary most european firms with a strong technological position typically operate from their home base in northern countries such as germany and austria despite important exceptions particularly in the industrial north of italy and spain many firms in the southern eurozone are relative technological laggards and the overall international competitiveness of southern economies has deteriorated due to the cumulative nature of the underlying processes existing differences in technological capabilities are to be seen as both a driving factor as well as a major outcome of long-term divergence within the eurozone grbner et al 2020b which is reflected in increasing macroeconomic polarisation as captured by fig 4 the macroeconomic impact of the corona crisis on northern and southern eurozone countries will be asymmetric due to existing differences in production structures and because of the vulnerabilities of the different growth models described above the most recent macroeconomic forecasts suggest that domestic demand will take a bigger hit in the southern eurozone than in northern eurozone countries see fig 5 given their relatively strong reliance on domestic demand as compared to exports this implies a particular challenge for these economies however germany and other northern eurozone countries will also not be able to rely on export-driven growth to the same extent as in the years 20102019 because china and other emerging asian economies also suffer greater economic losses which decreases their demand for imports moreover the global economy as a whole has been hit hard by the repercussions of the coronavirus international monetary fund 2020 and the partial disruption of global value chains will make an export-based recovery strategy more difficult to implement in the medium term as well however the data in fig 5 suggest that the overall challenge is considerably more difficult for countries in the south as domestic demand takes a bigger hit and exports decline more strongly figure 6 provides a breakdown of declining exports in terms of exports of goods and exports of services respectively thereby it points to yet another way in which structural polarisation patterns from the pre-corona years provide the conditions for an asymmetric effect of the corona shock while exports of goods are set to decline to a similar extent in northern and southern countries the much stronger drop in exports of services in the south exposes another vulnerability the prospects for booming global markets for export goods have deteriorated but the prospects for exports of servicesin particular concerning the tourism-related sectorsmay be even gloomier because of shifting preferences for tourist destinations and the restrictions imposed on international travel prolonged restrictions will have disproportionately strong negative effects on the regions in southern europe which clearly raises the prospect of accelerating macroeconomic divergence odendahl and springford 20204 moreover while at least some of the goods that have been produced for export but have not been sold yet can be put in storage and still represent an increase in value-added in the future services that have not been demanded in the present tend to be lost forever this suggests that the recovery process for southern countries will be more difficult than in northern countries the analysis above suggests thatin the absence of adequate coordinated european policy interventionsthe corona crisis will contribute to a further deepening of macroeconomic divergence and structural polarisation between northern and southern eurozone countries as economic polarisation fuels political polarisation this process puts the survival of the eurozone as a whole at risk in what follows we briefly evaluate european economic policy initiatives in response to the corona shock in this context we do not only inspect short-run issues but also explore whether and to what extent current policy measures are suitable for addressing the root causes of economic polarisation within the eurozone by drawing on a holistic analysis of policy-challenges induced or aggravated by this polarisationas developed by kapeller et al 2019 and summarized in table 1 below the first immediate european policy responses to the coronavirus came from the ecb which started to buy up government bonds on a large scale the pepp programme pandemic emergency purchase programme was put in place to prevent rising interest rate spreads and to ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy to the economy lane 2020 it serves to ensure that governments in the southern eurozone can continue to refinance at low interest rates during the corona crisis however as indicated by our analysis above southern eurozone countries such as italy and spain will not be able to get the economy back on track after the corona lockdown with the simple provision of cheap credit the eus fiscal rules have been temporarily suspended but southern countries are still suffering from legacy debt and problems related to structural polarisation which will become even more apparent when the fiscal rules suspension is lifted to further reduce their fiscal space in sum the ecb is as in past crises again acting as a lender of last resort to hold the eurozone together however existing institutional arrangements still pose constraints on the actions of the ecb therefore the corona crisis opens up a window for discussing a modified mandate for the ecb which widens it from a primary focus on price stability to also include a commitment to maximum employment and environmental sustainability however such discussions currently remain subordinated to the question about the short to medium run effects of the german constitutional courts recent ruling that the ecb has failed to adequately justify its quantitative easing program tooze 2020 in addition to the ecbs actions european leaders have decided on a package of loan assistance amounting to 540 billion euros a new esm credit line has been established up to 240 billion euros whichalthough only subject to minor conditionalitywill be limited to covering direct and indirect health costs however government spending on healthcare costs will not play a major role in the bigger picture of the costs of the crisis furthermore it is doubtful whether a country like italy would ever use such a credit line because the esm is seen to be politically toxic due to memories going back to the euro crisis in addition there is a new eu programme to grant member states cheap loans without conditions to support short-time work which is called sure support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency this will enable the eu to borrow on financial markets and to pass on the funds to the member states furthermore the package consists of loan guarantees from the european investment bank for companies even if european loans came with cheap conditions and light or no conditionality where especially the point concerning light conditionality remains doubtful they will nevertheless further increase public debt levels in southern euro countries hit hard by the pandemic much of the discussion concerning longer-term questions of european burden sharing has therefore revolved around the establishment of a so-called recovery fund and the possibility of grants however even if we assume that a sizeable recovery fund including a component of grants for the regions and sectors hit hardest by the pandemic is implemented over the horizon of the next couple of years such a short-run policy instrument would still prove insufficient if the goal is to reverse the underlying path-dependent process of polarisation between north and south without addressing the deeper problems of structural polarisation analysed in this paper any policy response to the corona crisis will suffer from limited impact in the long run to this end table 1 lists the policy suggestions for addressing polarisation as discussed in kapeller et al 2019 and compares them with actual corona-related policy measures and discussions comparing the policy measures currently undertaken or planned with the long-term challenges arising from economic polarisation in the eurozone reveals that the current policy focus is mostly on short-run measures to keep the economy going andor to jumpstart economic activities after lockdowns and other restrictions have been sufficiently released more medium- or long-term considerations currently play a subordinate role although crises like the current one always carry the potential to induce greater reflexion among policy-makers and social elites of all kind what seems most urgent given the current focus on organizing the means for significant public investment in economic recovery is to tie these funds to important medium-term concerns such as the reorganisation of global value chains the expansion of industrial policies to combat technological divergence on the regional and national level or probably most importantly recasting european economies in a way that is compatible with planetary boundaries in the context of climate change and indeed such links between pressing immediate demands and medium-term strategic challenges also partially coin the viewpoint of the european commission eg european commission 2020b which has tried to connect the corona-response with its longer-term vision of a european green deal however these connections remain relatively unspecific and underdeveloped as they do neither indicate specific strategies for reaping the alleged synergies nor have they led to a commitment towards increased funding of the european green deal such a commitment however seems highly necessary given that the current funding lags behind the investment requirements for achieving relevant goals concerning the reduction of co2 emissions wildauer et al 2020 however if such links between the corona-response and the european green deal could be established and further developed the hopefully occurring recovery from the corona-crisis could have positive spill-over effects that would be of great merit for confronting the socio-economic challenges around the corona-corner  positive rectal swabs in young patients recovered from coronavirus

syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has been responsible for 530000 infection cases with 23552 deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly1 a total of 197 counties have been involved in this emerging infectious disease on march 11 2020 dr tedros the world health organization director-general said that covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic for the alarming levels of spread severity and inaction in china diagnostic test by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay is the main means of confirmation and throat swab samples are collected for convenience and noninvasiveness2 however this technique has a certain rate of false-negative results which might render convalescent covid-19 patients to meet the current criteria of current discharge or discontinuation of quarantine resulting in spread of virus3 in clinical settings at least two repeat rt-pcr assays are performed to reduce the false-negative rate a recent study reported that four medical professionals aged from 30 to 36 years still had positive rt-pcr results 5-13 days after recovery4 which caused widespread concern however this phenomenon was not explained by authors we could not determine whether it was disease relapse or not in this study we followed up seven patients who had positive rt-pcr results after recovery from covid-19 pneumonia and tried to find the possible explanation this study was approved by the institutional review boards of the first affiliated hospital of jinan university and dongguan ninth peoples hospital and informed consent was waived the

 the time from hospital discharge to positive rt-pcr results after recovery was 711 days the patients were asymptomatic and chest ct images showed no change from the last scan before discharge they did not report contact with any suspected or confirmed person all the patients were admitted to hospital again because positive rectal swabs in six patients or positive throat swabs in one patient they were treated with chinese medicine toujiequwenkeli 11g twice daily orally the median length of second hospital stay was 10 days interquartile 6-10 days several days before the second discharge most patients had at least two repetitive negative rt-pcr tests of both throat and rectal swabs but the patients 3 6 and 7 continued the quarantine in designated hospitals because of negative throat swabs but positive rectal swabs after 2 14 and 2 days respectively rectal swabs of the three patients turned negative the time from initial positive to negative rectal swabs ranged from 5 to 23 days given that the first discharge criteria of patients were based on throat swabs instead of rectal swabs the longest rectal virus shedding might be more than 23 days in this case series we reported seven young patients who met the current criteria for discharge in china but still had positive rt-pcr test results 7-11 days after discharge these findings suggested that some recovered patients may still be virus carriers which questioned the current discharge criteria that two repetitive negative rt-pcr tests with a one-day gap between the two tests of throat swabs are necessary in this study most patients had two consecutive negative rt-pcr test results of throat swabs before discharge but positive rt-pcr test results of rectal swabs after discharge indicating the necessity of adding rt-pcr testing of rectal swab specimens to the criteria for discharge or discontinuation of quarantine the current discharge criteria can be more stringent if current testing load and medical resource allowed previous findings showed rectal swab-testing might be more useful than throat swab-testing in determining the effect of treatment and the timing of termination of quarantine7 a recent study showed persistent rectal swab positives even after nasopharyngeal swab testing turned negative in eight children8 it was speculated that different sampling tissues may have different levels of viral nucleic acid and lasting time of virus shedding the detection rate of specimens is limited by the level of viral nucleic acid viral shedding from the digestive system might be more severe and lasting longer than that from the respiratory tract more rectal swab positives were found in a later stage of infection as compared with oral swab positives suggesting viral shedding and transmitting through oral-fecal route9 in addition intermittent virus shedding might occur in recovered patients one patient had both negative throat and rectal swabs before hospital discharge but had positive throat swab during quarantine therefore positive rt-pcr results occurred in most patients recovered from covid-19 might not be caused by virus recurrence or second virus infection all the patients continued to be asymptomatic and chest ct showed no changes from previous images might also support this viewpoint although positive rt-pcr test results were found for convalescent patients antiviral therapy might not be needed because most patients rt-pcr results would turn negative in several days antibodies igm and igg against sars-cov-2 infection may be produced in these patients therefore the transmission risk is low even if the patients have positive rt-pcr test results after recovery antibody igg can persist a very long time10 although there is no firm evidence indicating these patients would transmit the virus to others we should be aware the potential way of transmission through the oral-faecal route11

12 patients should continue the quarantine in designated hospitals for at least 14 days and be followed up by rt-pcr assays of both throat and rectal swabs to avoid false-negative in addition psychological intervention is necessary for patients recovered from covid-19 but have positive rt-pcr results again because they may experience psychological problems including anxiety depression sleeplessness and stress the study was limited to a small number of patients with mild or moderate sars-cov-2 infection patients with severe or critically ill diseases should be included for further study large cohort study may be needed to confirm these findings the authors declare no competing interests  sars-cov-2 rna in wastewater anticipated covid-19 occurrence in a low prevalence area walter randazzo pilar truchado enric cuevas-ferrando pedro simn ana allende gloria snchez   coronaviruses covs are a family of viruses pathogenic for humans and animals associated to respiratory and gastro-intestinal infections covs used to be considered as minor human pathogens as they were responsible of common cold or mild respiratory infections in immunocompetent people channappanavar and perlman 2017 nonetheless the emergence of novel and highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases caused by covs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and most recently sars-cov-2 brings to light questions to be addressed to guide public health response covs are mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets meselson 2020 however as for sars and mers sars-cov-2 rna has been detected in stool samples from patients exhibiting symptoms of covid-19 and from asymptomatic carriers he et al 2020 pan et al 2020 wlfel et al 2020 young et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the duration of viral shedding has been observed to vary among patients with means of 1421 days y wu et al 2020b xu et al 2020 as well as the magnitude of shedding varies from 102 up to 108 rna copies per gram lescure et al 2020 pan et al 2020 wlfel et al 2020 infectious viruses deriving from fecal and urine specimen have reportedly been cultured in vero e6 cells sun et al 2020 w wang et al 2020b in addition gastric duodenal and rectal epithelial cells are infected by sars-cov-2 and the release of the infectious virions to the gastrointestinal tract supports the possible fecal-oral transmission route xiao et al 2020 even though the possibility of faecal-oral transmission has been hypothesized the role of secretions in the spreading of the disease is not clarified yet w wang et al 2020b y wu et al 2020b xu et al 2020 yeo et al 2020 wastewater monitoring has been a successful strategy pursued to track chemical and biological markers of human activity including illicit drugs consumption pharmaceuticals useabuse water pollution and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance genes choi et al 2018 de oliveira et al 2020 lorenzo and pic 2019 mercan et al 2019 viral diseases have been also surveilled by the detection of genetic material into wastewater as for enteric viruses hellmer et al 2014 prevost et al 2015 santiso-belln et al 2020 re-emerging zoonotic hepatitis e virus cuevas-ferrando et al 2020 miura et al 2016 and poliovirus during the global eradication programme asghar et al 2014 currently various studies detected sars-cov-2 rna in wastewater worldwide ahmed et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 lodder and de roda husman 2020 medema et al 2020 rimoldi et al 2020 f wu et al 2020a wurtzer et al 2020 and wastewater testing has been suggested as a non-invasive early-warning tool for monitoring the status and trend of covid-19 infection and as an instrument for tuning public health response daughton 2020 mallapaty 2020 naddeo and liu 2020 under current circumstance this environmental surveillance could be implemented in wastewater treatment plants as a tool designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown here we report the first detection of sars-cov-2 rna in untreated wastewater samples in spain collected from six different wastewater treatment plants wwtps in murcia the lowest prevalence area in iberian peninsula additionally the efficacy of the secondary and tertiary treatments implemented in the wwpts against sars-cov-2 has been confirmed the outcomes of the environmental surveillance reflect the epidemiological data in a low covid-19 diagnosed cases setting thus supporting the need of developing and implementing advanced models for wastewater-based epidemiology wbe influent secondary and tertiary treated effluent water samples were collected from six wwtps located in the main cities of the region of murcia spain fig 1

rt-qpcr assay included negative nuclease-free water and positive controls biobanked samples n  4 collected in october 2019 before the first covid-19 case was documented were used as relevant negative control to exclude false positive reactions sars-cov-2 rna was quantified as gc by plotting the quantification cycles ct to an external standard curve built with 10-fold serial dilution of a quantified plasmid control idt calibration curves for n1 y  33774x  41515 r2  095 n2 y  37752x  43951 r2  0989 and n3 y  -36006x  43142 r2  099 showed a linear dynamic range between 5  10 and 5  104 the limit of detection lod resulted as 50 gc per reaction with ct values of 3705  077 3812  024 and 3729  148 for n1 n2 and n3 respectively the theoretical limits of quantification of the overall method resulted as 445 491 and 475 log10 gcl for n1 n2 and n3 respectively mgv and pedv rna were quantified by plotting the cts to external standard curves generated by serial end-point dilution method using rna extracted from purified cell culture suspensions quantification were referred as pcru standard curve showed a linear dynamic range between 10 and 107 and between 10 and 105 for mgv y  3603x  3802 r2  099 and pedv y  -38281x3681 r2  098 respectively mgv recovery rates were calculated and used as quality assurance parameters according to iso 1521612017 iso 15216-1 2017 the aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation method was tested by spiking influent and effluent samples with mgv and pedv on average mgv was recovered at ranges of 11  21 in influent and 62  10 in effluent water pedv was recovered at ranges of 11  35 in influent and 33  16 in effluent water notably not significant differences p005 were detected between recovery rates in influent waters this finding implies that a non-enveloped virus may be used as process control for coronavirus detection in influent waters upon method validation in contrast significant differences p  005 were reported between pedv and mgv recoveries in effluent waters these results are in line with the mgv recoveries reported for enteric viruses concentration in water samples by the same aluminum-based method cuevas-ferrando et al 2020 randazzo et al 2019 and higher than the 1 as the quality assurance parameter indicated for bottled water into iso 1521612017 iso 15216-1 2017 similarly mgv was successfully used as recovery control for hepatitis e virus concentration from influent and effluent water samples 513 by applying a polyethylene glycol peg precipitation method miura et al 2016 a similar peg-based protocol was recently used to recover sars-cov-2 from wastewater although recovery control was not included in the study f wu et al 2020a moreover filtration through 10 kda centricon plus-70 centrifugal device successfully recovered sars-cov-2 in wastewater with recovery efficiencies of f-specific rna phages of 73 medema et al 2020 however concentration by electropositive membrane should be further evaluated given a sars-cov recovery from wastewater of 1 wang et al 2005 rigorous limits of detection should be established by spiking sars-cov-2 cell-culture adapted strain or positive covid-19 fecal samples in influent and effluent wastewater samples to be concentrated following the aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation method nonetheless the need of a bsl3 laboratory facility to handle sars-cov-2 represents the main limitation of this experiment a total of 42 influent and 18 secondary and 12 tertiary treated effluent water samples were collected from 12 march to 14 april 2020 and investigated for the occurrence of sars-cov-2 rna samples were considered positive for ct below 40 as in medema et al 2020 and f wu et al 2020a and titrated by using the quantified plasmid control for each of the rt-qpcr targets as expected biobanked samples collected in october 2019 before the first covid-19 case was documented tested negative for all the three rt-qpcr assays thus excluding false positive reactions the 83 35 positive samples out of 42 influent samples and the 11 2 out of 18 secondary treated water samples were tested positive for at least one sars-cov-2 rt-qpcr target none of the tertiary effluent samples 0 out of 12 tested positive for any of the sars-cov-2 rt-qpcr target fig 2
 a relevant number of influent water samples 12 showed ct ranging between 37 and 40 even though lower ct of 3437 were observed 29 in influent samples a poor positive correlation among rt-qpcr assays was detected being 05 03 and 06 the resulting coefficients between n1 and n2 n1 and n3 n2 and n3 respectively the total number of rt-qpcr determinations was 84 for each target for n1 23 results showed ct below 37 out of 33 positive samples 70 for n2 18 out of 31 58 and for n3 28 out of 36 78 in all samples mgv recoveries were above 1 11  15 mgv recovery for each sample and ct values for each sars-cov-2 target are reported in table s1 in supplementary material on average sars-cov-2 rna titers of 51  03 55  02 and 55  03 log10 gcl were quantified in wastewater by using n1 n2 and n3 primerprobe mixes respectively titers of 4 and 5 to more than 6 log10 gcl have been reported in massachusetts and france respectively f wu et al 2020a wurtzer et al 2020 a secondary effluent sample resulted positive for n2 and quantified as 54 log10 gcl an additional secondary effluent sample was positive for the three molecular targets and below the limit of quantification detection of sars-cov-2 rna in influent water has been reported worldwide ahmed et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 lodder and de roda husman 2020 medema et al 2020 f wu et al 2020a and only one study tested treated wastewater that resulted positive paris wurtzer et al 2020 we observed discrepancies among rt-qpcr n1 n2 and n3 assays for several water samples in agreement to a previous report medema et al 2020 this could be due to the different analytical sensitivity among the assays as well as the detection of possible false positive samples by rt-qpcr n3 in low concentrated clinical samples jung et al 2020 vogels et al 2020 the latter possibility has been solved by excluding the n3 primersprobe set from the us cdc 2019-ncov rt-qpcr diagnostic panel in its last revision march 30 cdc a cdc b nd in addition a partial inhibitory effect of the matrix is not to be completely excluded despite the controls included in the assays a more sensitive estimation of sars-cov-2 loads in wastewater should be studied by digital rt-qpcr drt-qpcr drt-qpcr could be used to quantify samples with low viral loads as reported for norovirus in wastewater monteiro and santos 2017 and sars-cov-2 in clinical samples dong et al 2020 suo et al 2020 even though it may not be the best practical and economically sustainable option for environmental surveillance abachin et al 2018 even though the sars-cov-2 rna detection in wastewater is functional for wbe purposes the risk for human health associated to the water cycle is still under debate as infectivity of viral particles in sewage and feces remain to be confirmed as well as its potential fecal-oral transmission a pre-print report suggests that the risk of infection from wastewater and river is negligible given the failure in cell culturing sars-cov-2 from water samples despite the high number of rna copies rimoldi et al 2020 in spite of the high concentration of viral rna in specimen and the evidence of gastrointestinal infection xiao et al 2020 infectious viruses from stools have been isolated in one study w wang et al 2020b while another attempt resulted without success wlfel et al 2020 the potential transmission of sars-cov-2 via wastewater has not been proven cdc a cdc b nd who 2020 and it seems unlikely given the poor stability of viable sars-cov-2 in wastewater rimoldi et al 2020 j wang et al 2020a that resembles some previous studies made with representative coronaviruses gundy et al 2008 and enveloped surrogates casanova and weaver 2015 as well the elevated sensitivity of human pathogenic coronaviruses to environmental conditions chin et al 2020 darnell et al 2004 darnell and taylor 2006 and disinfectants chin et al 2020 j wang et al 2020a suggests a poor risk of transmission via wastewater even though formal risk analysis needs to be performed haas 2020 epidemiological data on covid-19 in the murcia region have been retrieved from the publically available repository of the servicio de epidemiologia of the consejera de salud de la regin de murcia available at httpwwwmurciasaludesprincipalphp table 2

 in general rt-qpcr amplification signals have been detected in wastewaters when cases were diagnosed within the municipality positive wastewater samples have been detected with at least two out of three rt-qpcr assays in low prevalence municipalities as in murcia 96 cases 2118 cases per 100000 inhabitants cartagena 36 cases 1676 and molina de segura 12 cases 1669 of note positive wastewater samples were detected 1216 days before covid-19 cases were declared in lorca cieza and totana municipalities a similar study conducted in paris france demonstrated the detection of viral genome before the exponential phase of the epidemic wurtzer et al 2020 however our results indicate that sars-cov-2 can be detected weeks before the first confirmed case the early detection of sars-cov-2 rna in wastewater could have alerted about the imminent danger giving a valuate time to the managers to coordinate and implement actions to slow the spread of the disease therefore our outcomes support that wbe could be used as an early warning tool to monitor the status of covid-19 infection within a community on the other hand we believe that this environmental surveillance could be used as an instrument to drive the right decisions to reduce the risk of lifting restrictions too early for instance a key question is how to reduce the risk of a second wave andor recurring local outbreaks massive population tests are the first choice but in their absence wastewater monitorization of sars-cov-2 rna can give a reliable picture of the current situation our wastewater data do not quantitatively resemble the prevalence of covid-19 confirmed cases to this end a quantitative model that includes and corrects all the variables affecting these wastewater surveillance data would be useful for a better interpretation for instance not all covid-19 positive patients excrete sars-cov-2 rna in faeces and when it occurs the titers and the duration of shedding vary among individuals and across time he et al 2020 pan et al 2020 wlfel et al 2020 xu et al 2020 on the other hand the real number of positive cases within the murcia region remains unknown because of the large number of mild or asymptomatic carriers that have not been included in epidemiological statistics these aspects together with environmental variables eg rainfall events temperature hydraulic retention time in sewers increase the uncertainties linked to the correlation between sars-cov-2 rna detection in wastewater samples and the prevalence of covid-19 that could be explored by using complex models overall wastewater surveillance and wbe may represent a complementary approach to estimate the presence and even the prevalence of covid-19 in communities this represents an effective tool that needs to be further explored in order to direct public health response especially in cases of limited capacity for clinical testing the study was funded by the projects 20180705 of esamur 202070e101 of csic and

influence the work reported in this paper   jens meiler wenbiao chen meena madhur s   in only a few months the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 42 sars-cov-2 has caused a global pandemic leaving physicians scientists and public health 43 officials racing to understand treat and contain this zoonotic disease sars-cov-2 has made 44 the leap from animals to humans but little is known about variations in species susceptibility 45 that could identify potential reservoir species animal models and the risk to pets wildlife and 46 livestock while there is evidence that certain species such as cats are susceptible the vast 47 majority of animal species including those in close contact with humans have unknown 48 susceptibility hence methods to predict their infection risk are urgently needed sars-cov-2 49 spike protein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 is critical for viral cell entry 50 and infection here we identified key ace2 residues that distinguish susceptible from resistant 51 species using in-depth sequence and structural analyses of ace2 and its binding to sars-52 cov-2 our findings have important implications for identification of ace2 and sars-cov-2 53 residues for therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species with increased 54 susceptibility for infection on which to focus research and protection measures for 55 environmental and public health 56 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is the virus responsible for the 58 global pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 that is impacting millions of lives and 59 the global economy covid-19 is a zoonotic infection capable of crossing the species barrier 60 sars-cov-2 is thought to have originated in bats and subsequently transmitted to humans 61 perhaps through a secondary host 12 emerging experimental and observational evidence 62 demonstrates differences in species susceptibility to infection for example humans house 63 cats tigers and lions are all susceptible to infection by sars-cov-2 3-6 golden syrian hamsters 64 and rhesus monkeys are also capable of being experimentally infected by sars-cov-2 and 65 developing covid-19 pathologies 78 in contrast observational and experimental studies with 66 direct intranasal inoculation have demonstrated that chickens ducks and mice are not 67 susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection 5 9 10 11 interestingly however susceptibility is not 68 dichotomous although ferrets are also susceptible to infection intranasal inoculation failed to 69 result in spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract significantly limiting symptom 70 development 5 in addition although dogs failed to exhibit infection of the respiratory tract and 71 appear asymptomatic a minority of experimentally or environmentally exposed dogs exhibited 72 evidence of infection by sars-cov-2 pcr or sars-cov-2 seroconversion with production of 73 sars-cov-2-specific antibodies 512 while pigs have not demonstrated evidence of infection 74 after intranasal inoculation overexpression of swine ace2 in cultured cells supports some 75 degree of viral entry 5 9 13 hence ferrets dogs and pigs are classified as having intermediate 76 susceptibility to infection despite these findings the number of animal species tested for 77 susceptibility to infection in experimental or observational studies is very limited thus methods 78 of determining risk of species with unknown susceptibility are urgently needed to reduce risk of 79 propagating transmission protect food supplies identify potential intermediate hosts and 80 discover animal models for research identifying the key residues mediating susceptibility to 81 infection can also guide rational drug design 82 sars-cov-2 is a member of the coronavirus family of single-stranded rna viruses 9 the spike 83 protein on the surface of the sars-cov-2 virus mediates interaction with its receptor 84 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 to promote membrane fusion and virus entry into the 85 cell the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein contains a receptor binding motif 86 rbm that binds to the peptidase domain of ace2 14 following spike protein cleavage fusion of 87 the viral and host cell membranes occurs to enable viral entry into the cell 15 interaction of the 88 sars-cov-2 spike protein rbd and ace2 is thus critical for viral cell entry and infection 9 the 89 importance of this interaction in infection is further supported by evidence that exogenous 90 soluble ace2 limits infection in human organoids 10 and that overexpression of human ace2 is 91 necessary to enable viral cell entry in hela cells in vitro and sars-cov-2 infection in mouse 92 models in vivo 916 93 ace2 is present in almost all vertebrates however sequence differences exist that may hold 94 clues to differences in sars-cov-2 susceptibility as has been observed for sars-cov 1718 95 understanding such differences could provide insight into key structural interactions between 96 ace2 and sars-cov-2 rbd important for infection and permit development of a susceptibility 97 score for estimating the infection risk of various species in this manuscript we integrate 98 experimentally validated differences in susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection with ace2 99 sequence comparisons and in-depth structural analyses to determine how differences in ace2 100 across species influence interaction with sars-cov-2 rbd we identified multiple key residues 101 mediating structural interactions between ace2 and sars-cov-2 rbd and use these residues 102 to generate a susceptibility score to predict animals with elevated risk of infection we also 103 demonstrate that sars-cov-2 is nearly optimal for binding ace2 of humans compared to other 104 animals which may underlie the highly contagious nature of this virus amongst humans our 105 findings have important implications for identification of ace2 and sars-cov-2 residues for 106 therapeutic targeting and identification of animal species with increased susceptibility for 107 infection on which to focus research and protection efforts 108 109 results 110 given experimental evidence for susceptibility of humans house cats tigers lions rhesus 112 macaques and golden syrian hamsters to sars-cov-2 infection and experimental evidence 113 for non-susceptibility of mice ducks and chickens 3-579-1119 we performed protein sequence 114 alignment of ace2 from these organisms using mafft extended data figure 1  20 we also 115 included species with intermediate susceptibility including dogs pigs and ferrets 5912 as well 116 as species with unknown susceptibility including camels horses malayan pangolin and sheep 117 the degree of similarity of ace2 protein sequences largely fell along expected phylogenetic 118 relationships among species extended data figure 2  susceptibility to sars-cov-2 119 infection however did not match either phylogenetic relationships or ace2 sequence 120 similarities across species for example mouse mus musculus is not susceptible to infection 121 however mouse ace2 sequence is more similar to a susceptible species golden syrian 122 hamster mesocricetus auratus than non-susceptible species such as duck aythya fuligula or 123 chicken gallus gallus 916 in addition mice are phylogenetically more similar to susceptible 124 species such as humans homo sapiens and rhesus macaques macaca mulatta than non-125 susceptible species such as ducks and chicken 916 these findings suggest that neither 126 phylogenetic relationships nor overall ace2 protein sequence similarity across species is able 127 to predict susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection 128 an alternative approach is to use the experimentally validated differences in infection 131 susceptibility across species to focus on ace2 amino acids that most differ between susceptible 132 and non-susceptible species we thus calculated a weighted score of how well the aligned 133 amino acids stratify susceptible versus non-susceptible species incorporating amino acid 134 similarity this score termed groupsim permits quantitative determination of which amino 135 acids in the alignment best stratify susceptible from non-susceptible species 21 this analysis 136 demonstrated that multiple amino acid positions in the ace2 alignment including leu79 his34 137 tyr83 and gln24 are highly similar in susceptible species and quite different in non-susceptible 138 species extended data table 1 and supplemental table 1  when mapping these scores 139 onto the structure of the sars- cov-2 rbd and ace2 complex multiple residues with high  140  groupsim scores were present at or near the binding interface including his34 asp30 thr92  141 gln24 lys31 and leu79 figure 1  we then extended this analysis by focusing on key 142 residues previously demonstrated from prior structural analysis to be important for ace2 and 143 sars-cov-2 rbd interactions table 1  722-24 interestingly this revealed that key amino acids 144 for the ace2 and sars-cov-2 spike protein interaction were enriched among the top scoring 145 groupsim positions 7 of 35 p00001 fishers exact test such key residues based on 146 structural analysis being over-represented in amino acid positions that best discriminated 147 susceptible from non-susceptible species suggests that structural interactions between ace2 148 and sars-cov-2 spike protein importantly determine differences in species susceptibility to 149 infection in addition these data suggest that certain ace2 amino acid residues may be 150 particularly important for determining susceptibility including leu79 his34 tyr83 gln24 151 lys31 asp30 and glu329 152 we used homology modeling to identify structural determinants of binding the ace2 protein 155 from species with known differences in susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection the models 156 were based on previously reported crystal structures of the human ace2 in complex with 157 sars-cov-2 pdb 6lzg and 6m0j 14 we modeled ace2 in the presence of the sars-cov-2 158 rbd to allow backbone adjustment to the binder and refined by redocking of the rbd domain to 159 optimize sidechains models were selected by overall calculated protein stability of the sars-160 cov-2 rbd complex predicted binding energy between ace2 and sars-cov-2 rbd and 161 similarity as c-root mean square deviation c-rmsd extended data figure 3 and 162 extended data figure 4  based on these models multiple approaches where undertaken to 163 investigate the structural interactions between sars-cov-2-rbd and ace2 164 we evaluated the overall calculated protein stability and predicted binding energy for sars-165 cov-2-rbd and ace2 complexes for each species we considered the 100 best models for 166 each species and evaluated evidence for difference in binding energy or stability between 167 susceptible and non-susceptible species the average mean predicted binding energy and 168 calculated protein stability differs across species figure 2  consistent with the lack of 169 susceptibility of chickens gallus gallus chicken ace2 in complex with sars-cov-2-rbd was 170 the lowest scoring or most energetically unfavorable model the complex with duck ace2 171 aythya fuligula shows similarly unfavorable scores indicating that ace2 sequence differences 172 leading to a lower structural binding ability in these two avian species may explain their lack of 173 susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection however the complex of sars-cov-2-rbd and ace2 174 of the non-susceptible mouse mus musculus exhibits lower binding energy and higher protein 175 stability than several species that are susceptible including the lion panthera leo tiger 176 panthera tigris and cat felis catus thus differences in sars-cov-2 and ace2 complex 177 stability have some discriminative power but are not the sole factor in differences in 178 susceptibility across species 179 as a complementary approach to determine whether particular residues may discriminate 182 susceptible from non-susceptible species we performed energetic modeling of residue-residue 183 interactions in the interface of sars-cov-2 and ace2 using rosetta although the overall 184 interaction pattern across residues is similar between susceptible non-susceptible and 185 intermediate susceptibility species there are significant differences in the magnitude of residue-186 residue interactions figure 3 figure 4  this analysis also identifies residue 83 of ace2 as having 196 differential energetic interactions across species residue 83 is a tyrosine in susceptible species 197 and a phenylalanine in non-susceptible species table 1  compared to susceptible species 198 this position exhibits significantly decreased binding energy with residues asn487 and tyr489 in 199 sars-cov-2 rbd in non-susceptible species figure 3  although ace2 residue 83 also 200 interacts with sars-cov-2 rbd phenylalanine 486 this interaction is unlikely to be significantly 201 affected by differences between tyrosine and phenylalanine however the hydroxyl group of 202 tyrosine at position 83 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of asparagine 487 that 203 is negatively impacted by substitution to phenylalanine in non-susceptible species  figure 5a  in addition to this residue-residue structural analysis both ace2 positions 30 and 83 were 205 identified through the groupsim analysis described above to be top residues discriminating 206 susceptible from non-susceptible species based on sequence alignment extended data table  207 1 these results suggest that these amino acid positions of ace2 may be important mediators 208 of the structural interaction of ace2 and sars-cov-2 rbd and determinants of differences to 209 susceptibility to infection across species 210 it is an evolutionary advantage for sars-cov-2 to maintain its ability to infect multiple species 212 thus we hypothesized that the sequence of sars-cov-2 rbd is not optimized for a single 213 species but is capable of binding ace2 of multiple species multistate design is a computational 214 approach to test this hypothesis it allows us to determine the sequence of sars-cov-2 rbd 215 that is optimal for binding ace2 of multiple species we used restraint convergence recon 216 multistate design to test this hypothesis this method determines how many mutations one 217 protein requires to acquire affinity for multiple targets at once 2526 218 we adapted this strategy to evaluate the ability of the sars-cov-2-rbd to bind non-human 219 ace2 variants starting from the constraint of the known binding to human ace2 we 220 hypothesized that engineering a sars-cov-2 rbd with binding affinity for ace2 from non-221 susceptible species would require more changes to binding interface residues than for 222 susceptible species to test this hypothesis we redesigned the sars-cov-2 rbd interface 223 sequence using recon in the presence of the known binder human ace2 and ace2 from 224 other species in turn  figure 6a  225 as an initial positive control the sars-cov-2 rbd was redesigned against human ace2 only 226 by mutating multiple sars-cov-2 rbd residues to improve binding affinity we tested at each 227 designable position the frequency of native sequence recovery which measures the fraction of 228 models in which the native sars-cov-2 rbd amino acid is retained this resulted in very few 229 proposed amino acid changes of sars-cov-2 rbd to optimally bind human ace2 indicating 230 that the sars-cov-2 rbd sequence overall represents a solution close to optimal  figure 6b  231 the exception is valine 503 for which more polar amino acids were deemed optimal this 232 valine however is near a glycosylation site at asparagine 322 in ace2 at the sars-cov-2 and 233 ace2 interface extended data figure 5  since glycans are not incorporated into the recon 234 multistate design technique this valine 503 may have a higher affinity binding partner when 235 considering the presence of ace2 glycosylation sites 236 designing sars-cov-2 rbd in the presence of ace2 from additional species revealed that 237 ace2 from a number of species have lower sequence recovery including non-susceptible 238 species such as duck and chicken but also hamster macaque cat lion and dog when 239 evaluating residue-specific interactions based on the native sequence recovery from recon 240 multistate design tyrosine 505 shows no sequence recovery in avian species as compared to 241 the human ace2 control this tyrosine interacts very prominently with lysine 353 in ace2 242 however this residue is highly conserved across all species examined  table 1  tyrosine 505 243 also interacts less strongly with glycine 354 which is occupied by an asparagine in the avian 244 species chicken and duck  table 1 and figure 5b  this secondary interaction might explain 245 the differences in native sequence recovery however another experimentally verified non-246 susceptible species the mouse mus musculus has a high degree of sequence recovery 247 similar to human ace2 this suggests that other factors beyond residue-residue interactions of 248 ace2 and sars-cov-2 rbd at the interface may determine susceptibility to infection at least 249 in the mouse and that differences in recon multistate design explain only partially differences 250 in species susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection 251 as a final additional approach to structurally evaluate differences in species susceptibility we 253 investigated the predicted glycosylation profiles of various species in comparison to human 254 ace2 protein glycosylation is increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to receptor-ligand 255 interactions 27 however given the challenges in identifying glycans in protein crystal structures 256 glycosylation has received considerably less attention than sars-cov-2 rbd and ace2 257 protein-protein interactions naturally occurring glycans as posttranslational modifications are 258 not fully visible in crystal structures normally only the first n-actylglucosamine is visible or no 259 sugar moiety can be observed or glycosylation sites are mutated prior to crystallization in the 260 crystal structures of the human ace2 used here a sugar moiety bound to an asparagine at a 261 surface exposed nxts sequon was seen three times in proximity to the binding interface on 262 the ace2 to understand whether the ace2 of other species have similar glycosylation 263 patterns glycosylation was predicted using netnglyc 10 a neural network for predicting n-264 glycosylation sites and compared to the glycosylation patterns of human ace2 28 species this suggests a potential mechanism by which mice may be non-susceptible despite 276 having similar binding energy and sars-cov-2 native sequence recovery to susceptible 277 species 278 taken together results of these studies reveal a set of key ace2 residues important for 280 interaction with sars-cov-2 rbd and for which differences help discriminate susceptible from 281 non-susceptible species these differences include ace2 amino acid positions 30 and 83 282 which exhibit differential residue-residue binding energy position 354 which exhibits low native 283 sequence recovery in interaction with sars-cov-2 and positions 90 and 322 which exhibit 284 differences in glycosylation using these key residues in aggregate we developed a sars-285 cov-2 susceptibility score based on similarity to the human ace2 sequence using the 286 blosum62 similarity matrix table 3  29 sheep ovis aries 296 to permit wider use of this susceptibility score for evaluation of additional species with unknown 297 susceptibility including those species that in the future may be of particular concern we 298 developed an implementation of the susceptibility score algorithm in r for public use this 299 implementation takes as input human ace2 aligned with ace2 of another species of interest 300 and provides a susceptibility score using differences in ace2 positions 30 83 90 322 and 301 354 r code for implementation of this algorithm as a graphical user interface is available in 302 supplemental methods 303 here we tested the hypothesis that differences in ace2 proteins across various species alter 305 structural interactions with sars-cov-2 rbd leading to differences in species susceptibility to 306 sars-cov-2 infection our results combining prior knowledge of experimentally validated 307 differences in species susceptibility with multiple methods of determining effects on ace2 308 structure and interaction with sars-cov-2 rbd reveal five key residues that in aggregate help 309 discriminate susceptibility across species these include ace2 positions 30 83 and 354 which 310 exhibit alterations in binding energy and positions 90 and 322 which exhibit alterations in 311 glycosylation that likely contribute to differences in interactions at the interface taken together 312 our results provide insight into the molecular determinants of species susceptibility to sars-313 cov-2 infection and have important implications for identification of key residues for therapeutic 314 targeting and determining susceptibility of additional species to infection 315 our study has several unique features that permit rigorous evaluation of differences in species 316 susceptibility to infection prior studies have similarly performed ace2 sequence alignments 317 across species and modeled structural effects of the amino acid changes on the sars-cov-2 318 and ace2 interface 730-35 however our study integrates experimentally validated susceptibility 319 to sars-cov-2 with in-depth structural analyses to determine critical ace2 residues for 320 infection in addition we performed multiple structural analyses including residue-residue 321 interactions recon multistate design and glycosylation analysis to rigorously determine the 322 structural basis for species differences in ace2 interaction with sars- humans and the importance of these animals as domestic companions and laborers worldwide 361 make determination of their susceptibility an urgent need the use of the susceptibility score 362 developed here can also be applied to additional species of interest to help direct resources for 363 focused research and protection efforts in the future 364 ace2 residues identified in this paper that provide a structural basis to differences in species 365 susceptibility to infection reveal important insights into the sars-cov-2 rbd and ace2 366 structural interaction and potential for therapeutic targeting by incorporating differences in 367 species susceptibility into the structural analysis our findings enhance the potential to identify 368 particularly important residues mediating the ace2 and sars-cov-2 rbd interaction indeed 369 although groupsim scores were not used in the structural analysis three of the five key 370 identified residues 30 83 and 90 from the structural modeling are in the top scoring ace2 371 positions by groupsim score this suggests that the amino acids at these positions in ace2 372 differ significantly between susceptible and non-susceptible species consistent with an 373 important contribution of these residues to differences in susceptibility amino acid positions 30 374 and 83 of ace2 in particular exhibited large differences in residue-residue interaction binding 375 energies between susceptible and non-susceptible species asp30 on ace2 interacts with 376 residues lys417 phe456 and tyr473 of sars-cov-2 rbd and ace2 tyr83 interacts with 377 asn487 and tyr489 of sars-cov-2 rbd these amino acids mark sites of sars-cov-2 378 interaction with ace2 that may be important for development of antibody-based therapies or 379 small molecule inhibitors 380 applying a multistate design algorithm to probe the sars-cov-2-rbd interactions for their 381 ability to cross-bind to ace2 of multiple species yielded several novel observations first this 382 technique identified ace2 position 354 as an important site for differentiating binding and non-383 binding ace2 of different species to sars-cov-2 rbd second this approach demonstrated 384 that the sars-cov-2 rbd sequence is nearly optimal for binding to human ace2 compared to 385 other species this is a remarkable finding and likely underlies the high transmissibility of this 386 virus amongst humans this finding is also consistent with recent results that compared sars-387 cov and sars-cov-2 and determined that a number of differences in the sars-cov-2 rbd 388 have made it a much more potent binder to human ace2 through the introduction of numerous 389 hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic networks 39 390 although ace2 and sars-cov-2 rbd interactions are critical to sars-cov-2 infection 91016 391 differences in other factors across species may also contribute to differences in susceptibility this includes differences in ace2 expression levels 40 and differences in the protein sequence of 393 tmprss2 a protein that contributes to viral and host cell membrane fusion through cleavage of 394 spike protein 15 41 with further experimental and observational data on infectability of currently 395 unknown species the susceptibility score we have developed can also help determine species 396 for which differences in ace2 protein may not inadequately predict differences in susceptibility for these species future studies could compare differences in expression levels of ace2 andor 398 differences in tmprss2 structure these structural comparisons of tmprss2 however will 399 require elucidation of the protein crystal structure which is not yet available 400 we combined in-depth structural analyses with knowledge of varying species susceptibility to 403 sars-cov-2 infection to determine key structural determinants of infection susceptibility first 404 we identified multiple key residues mediating structural interactions between ace2 and sars-405 cov-2 rbd differences in these residues were used to generate a susceptibility score that when two true binders are redesigned they should require few sequence changes thus 624 resulting in a higher native sequence recovery in contrast if the native sequence recovery for 625 the interface residues is lower then many sequence changes are required indicating that one 626 of the ace2 proteins is a non-binder b residue-specific native sequence recovery as 627 determined from recon multistate design against the sars-cov-2-rbd complex with human 628 ace2 only residues of the sars-cov-2-rbd which are in the protein-protein interface and 629 show changes are depicted homology modeling of ace2-sars-cov2 co-crystal structures using rosettacm 660 ace2 of human and non-human species was modeled based on two co-crystal structures of 661 sars-cov-2-rbd with the human ace2 pdb-ids 6lzg and 6m0j 14 one co-crystal structure 662 pdb-id 6vw1 was excluded due to its lower resolution as compared to the aforementioned 663 structures the target sequences were threaded over the ace2-sars-cov-2-rbd co-crystal 664 structure which was first relaxed with backbone constraints using rosettarelax 47 a total of 665 1000 homology models were constructed using rosettacm and subsequently relaxed with 666 backbone constraints 4748 of these 25 models were selected based on the total energy as a 667 measure of protein stability predicted

than -2400 reu were evaluated the native sequence recovery was 684 calculated for each pairwise experiment and also for the control run for the sars-cov-2-rbd 685 complex with the human ace2 extended

structures pdb 6lzg and 6m0j and scored with high 695 confidence from netnglyc 10 these were selected as reliably glycosylated position 103 was 696 included as it was strongly predicted to be glycosylated by netnglyc 10 although no 697 glycosylation was observed in the crystal structures furthermore it was evaluated whether the 698 nxts sequons were surface accessible and in proximity to the ace2-sars-cov-2-rbd 699 binding interface 700 using identified ace2 key amino acid positions 30 83 90 322 and 354 in the alignment of 702 ace2 across species a global susceptibility score was calculated as the sum of the blosum62 703 scoring matrix substitutions for the amino acid at each position compared to the human ace2 704 sequence 29 this was calculated for each species with higher scores suggesting greater 705 susceptibility an r implementation of this susceptibility score algorithm was also developed in 706 rstudio the software takes as input alignment of human ace2 protein sequence with ace2 of 707 another species of interest and provides a susceptibility score as output susceptibility scores of 708 species examined in this manuscript are also graphically demonstrated

recovery for the covid-19 pandemic are we there yet the transition from response to recovery for the covid-19 pandemic bapon fakhruddin kevin blanchard durga ragupathy   governments are faced with a myriad of multi-dimensional effects of the pandemic including direct impacts on public health systems and population health and indirect socioeconomic effects including disruption to every single sector of the economy and mass unemployment there is additionally the growing realisation that the timescale associated with this crisis may permanently change the very foundations of societies normal day-to-day life as the world transitions to recovering from covid-19 those developing that recovery need support in adjusting and improving their policies and measures the situation seems dire the stakes are high literature about the transition between the response and recovery phase in relation to pandemics is scarce further complication is that the pandemic will not allow countries to simply transition to the full-scale recovery instead a rebound from recovery to response phase is expected for a certain period until the immunization is in place pandemics indeed force us to think beyond typical emergency management structures the cycles of the disaster risk management in the case of biological and other natural hazards are not exactly the same and no one-size-fits-all approach may be used still some parallels may be drawn with the efforts to combat natural hazards and some lessons may be used from previous and the current pandemic based on these experiences and reflections this paper provides a set of policy directions to be considered during the transition towards as well as throughout this transition phase it is suggested that meeting this global multi-dimensional and complex challenge will require considerable international collaboration even convention and macro-scale changes to global and national policies the recovery issues are mainly going to be dominated by politics economics and social science necessary for an effective recovery the pandemic response needs to be a holistic response combined with an improved data ecosystem between the public health system and the community j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f the consequences of any new virus are always unforeseen and become more and more multisectoral as time compounds them at all levels from an individual to the macro level 1  these consequences although uncertain can be reduced with sound policy however the policy for pandemic crisis is unlike that applied to natural hazards pandemics force us to think outside of the box or in this case outside the typical emergency management cycle figure 1  in other words while four phases to reduce the impact of a natural hazard preparedness response recovery and mitigation are principally linear the response and recovery phases for a pandemic are essentially non-linear to illustrate unlike earthquakes cyclones or other natural hazards which are usually one-off events occurring within a limited period covid-19 or any other pandemic tend to come in several waves over a protracted period -until the effective vaccine or herd immunity is in place such as 1918 influenza pandemic and ebola virus disease occurred in multiple waves saunders-hastings  krewski 2016  also natural hazards tend to impact relatively confined areas the covid-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 and already in april 2020 the virus has affected 185 out of 195 countries johns hopkins university 2020 a response to biological and natural hazards follows the same disaster risk management cycle -but in the case of pandemics alert and pandemic phases reporting the increase of the global average of cases with the highest number in the pandemic phase correspond to the response phase of disaster risk management while a transition phase reporting the significant decrease of the global average of cases correlates with the recovery from a disaster biological disasters present challenges for both the response and recovery stages due to their sheer complexity jeremias  martin nd  due to the very nature of pandemics there will be a constant change in the way we approach and implement organisation structure tools and technologies as well as emergency management recovery and business continuity plans each new wave of a 1 at an individual level a persons income access to food other health care outside of that related to the pandemic are all impacted at the macro end of the consequences financial structures of both public and private institutions political stability or instability and tensions are impacted j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f pandemic is distinct where the same approach in policy may not be applicable and revisions after each wave may be required to minimise the new consequences figure 2  transitioning from pandemic response to recovery in a spiral fashion there is a high probability of the second and even the third wave of a pandemic if there is no vaccine or immunization each new wave pushing the disaster risk reduction cycle from the recovery back to response phase in the midst of the covid-19 emergency on march 22 2020 zagreb croatia was hit by a 53 magnitude earthquake as the country dealt with 206 covid-19 patients walker 2020  in canada manitoba province and ottawa city fought against flooding caused by snow melting a month later cyclone harold wreaked havoc on the solomon islands fiji vanuatu and tonga placing extra stress on their already stretched governments as the need for additional funds medical supplies and food rose lyons 2020  in vanuatu this was further strained by the measures put in place for the covid-19 response sbs 2020 2  while local governments in japan suspended receiving volunteers engaged in rehabilitation works in areas devastated by typhoon hagibis in 2019 the bangladesh government prepared for both cyclones and a covid-19 outbreak in the coxs bazar camps which shelter some 900000 rohingya refugees ishiwatari et al 2020  the world is facing the same type of difficulties to manage natural hazards as pre-pandemic whilst also investing in considerable efforts to flatten the covid-19 curve and yet with rapidly changing climate and ecology hastily marching urbanisation and increased travel pandemics will become j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f more frequent and more complex perhaps the single common thread of pandemics cyclones floods and earthquakes is that they become ever more intense magnified and complex in nature fundamentally the issues to respond to these events are political at a number of levels including within the scientific community with competing interests between the various sciences social biological and health-based particularly noticeable this will be no different in the recovery phase ensuring consideration at all levels on government response policies plans and logistics regarding the process in which they respond to other emergencies during the pandemic whilst ensuring scientific harmony is crucial in ensuring effective response recovery times and financial and political stability the existing framework of disaster risk management policies national regional and global has largely been designed to ensure a swift and effective recovery along the traditional disaster risk management cycle the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction agreed in 2015 focused the attention of signatory member states on preparing for a range of hazards including those of a geophysical hydrological climatological and meteorological nature importantly it also included a strong public health focus and consideration of the risks from biological hazards maini et al 2017  however the sendai framework did not distinguish the cascading impact of biological and other hazards in a systematic risk management approach the emerging thinking is that the concept of pandemic must evolve from crisis response during discrete outbreaks to an integrated cycle of preparation response and recovery bedford et al 2019  the recent global risk assessment framework graf promises to inform and focus action within and across sectors and geographies by decision makers at local national regional and global levels to improve the understanding and management of current and future risks at all spatial and temporal scales gordon 2020 despite the two-decade experience of public health crises caused by novel virus infections such as hiv influenza a virus subtype h1n1 and h5n1 sars-cov1 mers-cov and ebola the epidemiological novelty of covid-19 and its rapid spread caught many governments unprepared  the response of all governments organisations and individuals at all levels national or internationals has been put to the test a number of governments around the world failed to act on their warnings about a pandemic due to not understanding the magnitude of the problem so-called strong man politicians lack of updated or public risk registers and other various reasons tyler and gluckman 2020 as the world continues to combat the covid-19 pandemic impacts rapid evaluations of the strategies of various countries provide insights for all stakeholders to adjust and improve policy options not all strategies have yielded positive results in fact while some were commended as effective such as the response from singapore germany and new zealand others were criticised as devastating for example high infection and death rates in iran italy south korea and the united states  as an illustration singapores approach to the covid-19 outbreak has been rated as effective as it managed to keep both the infection rates low and the economy strong lai  tan 2015  one of the key success factors of singapores efforts has been assigned to the fact that singapore has learned from their recent pandemics experience in 2000 singapore experienced an outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease which affected more than 3000 young children causing three deaths later in 2003 sars hit singapore infecting 238 people 33 of whom died of this disease in 2009 avian influenza h1n1 struck singapore affecting 1348 people with 18 deaths lai a y  tan s l 2015  one of the most important lessons that the singapore government learned from the sars epidemic was the detrimental role of j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f the bureaucratic structure in handling fluid and unprecedented situations recognising that the effective response and recovery for covid-19 depends on a large number of stakeholders the health of all depends on each of us httpswwwgovsg the singapore government has led a well-coordinated multi-stakeholder response and recovery which has been praised by other countries however singapore paid far too little attention to their hundreds of thousands of migrants living in crowded dorms excluded from government initiatives among whom sars-cov2 is now spreading quickly ratcliffe 2020  sadly this was also reported in germany where there was a rise in cases where refugees were not accommodated properly oltermann 2020  new zealands success factors were determined leadership and bold action early in the pandemic outbreak because of early and strong action only a small number of new zealanders got infected were tested contact was traced and they were isolated this prevented widespread transmission overwhelming the medical system along with the inherent effects such as widespread shortages of tests and personal protective equipment experiences from the previous pandemic crisis offer more insights and the responses of different governments may broadly be categorised as effective or ineffective table 1  briceo 2015 lai and tan 2015 and spiekermann et al 2015  lack of knowledge on how to disseminate information correctly weak community vigilance and lack of public education measures lack of collaboration between major parties with the lack of risk management integration into major sectors eg health infrastructure tourism environment evidence-based decision making with the effective use of big data lack of support to community in lockdown j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f parallels may also be made between the effectiveness of the countrys response to pandemics and to natural hazards for instance the response to the devastation caused by the 2017 hurricane maria in dominica and the surrounding caribbean nations was characterised by most of the ineffective responses from table 1  the combination of poor technology and data collection systems inadequate reporting lack of public awareness and inclusiveness led to poor information being disseminated to people during the hurricane this in turn inhibited people from preparing and therefore led to inaction and placed people at greater risk to the hurricane tonkin  taylor international limited 2020 these very factors seem to also arise when reviewing the responses to covid-19 in countries such as iran and italy  the primary mission during the response phase is saving lives and livelihoods jeremias  martin nd  this as seen from the response of many governments to the covid-19 outbreak relies on the communications policy the limited capacity for vaccinating against a novel coronavirus in the early stages results in a more concerted policy direction around communication of public health guidance and instructions including lockdown and social distancing dickmann et al 2016  this policy is often targeted at the most vulnerable community members or is aimed at informing the wider public audience about the risks to the most vulnerable dickmann et al 2016  indeed much of the work in the response phase of a biological disaster revolves around the dissemination of information at national or regional levels figure 3  one of the tried-and-tested approaches to responding to pandemic disasters is the epidemiological process of understanding disease transmission including by contact tracing osullivan et al 2019  this type of response differs to that of a geophysical hazard in that it is concerned with individuals rather than the wider picture lee  riley 2006  while this strategy requires a considerable amount of resources it has been effective in reducing the impacts of an outbreak for example in south korea implemented along with wide-scale testing and containment mccurry 2020 while many countries are only just managing the multiple aspects of the response phase the covid-19 outbreak will very likely subside eventually through herd immunity or vaccination and there will be a period of recovery policy for the recovery from pandemics will differ from traditional recovery in a number of ways largely due to the global scale and sheer complexity of covid-19 pandemics furnival 2020  one of the initial policy manoeuvres many governments will want to make will be returning economic activity to normal or as close to normal as possible this effort to restart trade manufacturing and services will differ from those during natural hazards in both scale and complexity table 2  table 2  some elements of the response and recovery phases during natural hazards hydrometeorological and geohazards and biological disasters from pandemics are the same -but each needs to be carefully considered and specified unless or until we acquire full natural or vaccine-induced immunity to covid-19 or if an eventual vaccine is only partially protective we face the threat of a new endemic disease that will fundamentally change human society it sounds alarmist -we admit -but it is becoming distinctly possible based on what we have learned so far like the human immune system whose reaction may sometimes be part of the cause of death from the viral disease -reactions of all stakeholders and the public to the pandemic can have positive as well as negative consequences therein lies the greatest risk and with it the strongest need to remain calm and in control we are now in a global high-risk situation and the direct threat of covid-19 may not turn out to be our biggest problem as the world is transitioning to recovery the following policy considerations are important and need to be considered picture the governments playing whack-a-mole 3  hammering the new waves of virus reemerging in hotspots with the yet again forced stay-at-home measures reactivated temporary hospitals sourcing extra healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment this is indeed an unwanted but warranted scenario as with fire it is not a question of if but when wildland fire suppression personnel and equipment serve as an excellent model for preparedness levels and mobility of resources throughout the fire season countries shall be in this mindset for pandemics too covid-19 hotspot outbreaks may be managed in the same way with the inclusion of testing monitoring and contact tracing data-based modelling may provide a framework within which the details are hammered out among key stakeholders government private and non-governmental organisations our concept of pandemics shall move to an interdisciplinary science with an integrated approach of medical science and public health with medical research and development social sciences diplomacy biomedical science big data information technology artificial intelligence statistics meteorology biotechnology ecology and so on -combined to provide an integrated cycle of prevention preparation response and recovery the international community should recognise the opportunity afforded them through already agreed policy frameworks such as the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction united nations sustainable development goals and climate change conventions and agreements these policy tools have been largely agreed and ratified in each of the countries impacted and as such many of the processes to respond monitor and recover are already established within domestic legislations building recovery around these frameworks can also provide a greater level of cohesion among member states who may be at different stages of the pandemic we have seen a number of countries reducing the level of public funding for their healthcare systems or internationally focused biological observation and scanning initiatives these funding reductions have been cited as one reason the covid-19 pandemic has been so destructive governments and international organisations should use the opportunity of j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f recovery and demand from their public to invest in measures to ensure future novel viruses or biological threats are identified early beyond health risks depending on the characteristics of the pathogen pandemics cause risks and related disasters in multiple sectors such as agriculture public transport logistics finance and security a very lethal pathogen could cause a total global shutdown resulting in famine or another unforeseeable secondary disaster because each new pathogen usually has unknown characteristics the response decision making is highly flawed and error-prone the pandemic response needs to be a holistic response multi-sector pandemic planning and active drills with representatives from different sectors can help countries and cities to prepare for such complex chains of decisions and consequences international communication cooperation collaboration and even established convention should be considered reconsidered and strengthened for prevention of pandemics leadership in terms of financial support and policy development will need to come from established international organisations such as the world bank asian development bank and united nations and groupings like the g20 and g7 while advanced organisations and groups will need to lead these efforts they have the financial capacity and resources to do so the inclusion of developing countries and non-traditional agents including nongovernmental organisations is necessary and ultimately inevitable while a number of countries in recent years have taken domestic policies that have gone against international cooperation and some responses to the covid-19 pandemic have seen bilateral spats between countries the scale and complexity of this crisis calls for an international recovery that will only be achieved through global cooperation at all levels also strengthening epidemiology public health and laboratory capacity in low-and middle-income countries is essential though collaboration j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f cascading problems in fact the director-general of the who mentioned an infodemic referring to unprecedented misinformation that spread faster and more easily than the virus hampering a public health response improved information flow between the public health system and the community is necessary for an effective recovery the use of data from people is becoming strictly controlled whereas contact tracing is needed to better understand how infections spread a data ecosystem is critical to ensure a stable transition from the response to the recovery phase fakhruddin 2020  a system shall be used where communities feed information into the public health system and the feedback loop offers a fast and direct way to provide people with details of potential actions they can take some have called the covid-19 outbreak a dress rehearsal for climate change large-scale global impacts on the economy and our day-to-day lives those living in poverty being among the worst impacted have been evidenced during the covid-19 outbreak but are also predicted and in some cases already happening in relation to our changing climate the international community as well as individual countries should use the lessons we are learning through the outbreak to ensure we are better prepared for the changes happening already and to limit or stop the increasing levels of risk caused by climate change
