high throughput and comprehensive approach to develop multiepitope vaccine against minacious covid-19 rupal ojha nidhi gupta biswajit naik satyendra singh vijay verma kumar dhaneswar prusty vijay prajapati kumar   coronavirus disease covid-19 named by the world health organization who is the causative agent for latest ongoing respiratory infection outbreak which started in late 2019 in wuhan hubei china huang et al 2020 its first case was reported in late november 2019 coronavirus belongs to coronaviridae family and is an enveloped non-segmented virus which possess positive sense rna as a genomic material this particular outbreak is thought to be correlated with a crowded seafood market in wuhan china which has been closed since 23 january 2020 several investigation teams are working for the identification of origin of the spread by april 28 2020 there are 2954222  3 million confirmed cases of covid-19 globally out of them 84341 were from china mainland and 4643 deaths have been attributed reported by who outside china mainland there are reports that 213 other countriesterritories around the globe are affected with highest cases recorded in european region which has crossed 13 million 1359380 confirmed cases and 124525 claimed lives followed by regions of americas which has 1140520 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 58492 claimed lives who situation report 98 there are several host where coronavirus infections have been reported such as avian hosts zhu et al 2020 mammals like dogs cats camels mice masked palm civets and bats reports has been shown the identification of novel mammalian coronaviruses now almost on regular basis for instance coronavirus named hku2 was originated from bat in 2018 and infected the pigs which further showed the fatal diarrhoea syndrome httpswwwwhointdocsdefault-sourcecoronavirusesituation-reports20200305-sitrep-45-covid-19pdfsfvrsned2ba78b2 spread of already known human coronaviruses is not so threatening ie they have shown only mild clinical symptoms cavanagh 2007 while two evident exclusions are severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus in 21st century means in last two decades sars-cov belongs to genera betacoronaviruses that originated from guangdong province in southern part of china in year 2002 ismail et al 2003 which unfortunately claimed 774 human lives and 8000 infections in human from 37 countries around the globe in 2002 to 2003 zhou et al 2018 another outbreak mers-cov was started from saudi arab in 2012 zhou et al 2018 and 2494 infection cases of mers-cov were reported as laboratory confirmed cases with 858 fatal cases from 2012 to date which includes claim of 38 lives su et al 2016 past two outbreaks and a recent ongoing outbreak may only be a fraction of what yet to come or can be seen and understood ie more severe and possibly new zoonotic infections of coronaviruses incidences yet to be discovered which shows a worldwide warning to public health peiris et al 2004 researchers are trying to solve the enigma of the origin of the sars-cov-2 as per evolutionary virologist it is rarely possible the direct jump of the virus from bat to human there should be one connecting link between them now the puzzle is which animal worked as a transient host from bats to humans recent announcement but those studies still have not published revealed an intermediate candidate ie pangolins as transient host a high mortality rate of the past incidences shows the imperative need of the successful vaccine candidate which can ultimately lead to the prevention of such outbreaks the best way to overcome with the present situation and also preparedness for the upcoming outbreaks is the development of the vaccine against this deadly covid-19 particularly in the absence of any effective drug treatment against these deadly viruses vaccines are considered to be an obligate requirement the continuous spread of this devastating viral infection with high mortality rate demands a protected and efficient vaccine in modern times multi-epitope subunit vaccine mesv formulation is newest way to fight against deadly pathogens epitopes cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl helper t lymphocytes htl and b-cell lymphocytes bcl ie short stretches of amino acid sequences of protein can elicits direct and strong immune response then response generated by whole protein itself kao et al 2009 nevertheless for the development of the mesv amino acid sequence of the immunogenic proteins of interest should be known scientist working in chinese center for disease control and prevention  national institute for viral disease and prevention in beijing china and their associate collaborators emancipated whole genome sequence of covid-19 and shared on all public databases demonstrating fast sequencing of genome in the response of devastating outbreak which is helping in better diagnosing and treatment of further incidences upon initial analyses sequencing data revealed the homology at protein sequence level with sars-cov and might latches onto human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor chan-yeung and yu 2003 developing vaccine against covid-19 is very challenging since research to develop a vaccine against earlier coronaviruses outbreaks like sars and mers generated only limited responses zumla et al 2019 the past research work was more attentive on the viral spike s glycoprotein and receptor binding domain rbd of this glycoprotein shi et al 2015 but those strategies are now giving us the jumping off points for the development of vaccine against deadly novel covid-19 hypothetically almost all proteins of the miniature organism viruses are potential vaccine targets shi et al 2015 in an incredibly fast piece of study it has been shown that once this virus installed itself into the human body it encodes its tool proteins which helps in the replication these tool proteins ie non-structural proteins are the key toolkit to synthesize the other structural proteins spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid and factors which requires to grow its progeny lewis et al 2020 in our strategy of vaccine development we have engineered the toolkit ie non-structural proteins which includes 3-c like proteinase yp0097253011 rna dependent rna polymerase yp0097253071 helicase yp0097253081 3-5 exonuclease yp0097253091 2-o-ribo methyl transferase yp0097253111  endornase yp0097253101 all these proteins have also used as a drug target for commercially available antiviral drugs to fight against sudden outbreak of covid-19 since there are no specific antivirals available beck et al 2020 further several non-structural proteins make the replicase-transcriptase complex which ultimately helps in the replication and transcription of virus genomic rna ziebuhr 2005 the 3-c like proteinase is a protease present in all coronaviruses which helps in proteolysis of the non-structural protein 5 nsp5 during replication process of virus tomar et al 2015 this makes it a high value vaccine candidate against the coronavirus further a key enzyme of coronavirus replication and transcription system is rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp which is encoded by nsp12 also appears as an attractive target for therapeutics gao et al 2020 this enzyme catalyses the viral rna synthesis and therefore plays an important role in the replicationtranscription process during covid-19 infection helicase of coronavirus encodes by nsp13 helps in the parting of dsdna and rna in a 5  3 direction adedeji and lazarus 2016 endoribonuclease is an enzyme encoded by nsp15 which cleaves specially at uridine residues and another replicative enzyme that is exoribonuclease encoded by nsp14 possess the n7-methyltransferase activity and also involved in checking fidelity of the replication whereas nsp16 encodes for 2-o-ribo methyl transferases remarkably nsp14 and nsp15 both ribonucleases are distinct to nidovirales order which are envisaged genetic markers for the viruses belongs to this order bhardwaj et al 2004 snijder et al 2003 however a recent insilico study has anticipated that several non-structural proteins work as adhesins which plays role in the adhesion and invasion into the host cell ong et al 2020 hence these tool proteins which makes the replicationtranscription machinery complex and also function as adhesins could be good candidate for vaccine development to develop a strong and potential vaccine we have used an immunoinformatic approach and also shown its binding with the human immune receptor tlr-3 by molecular interaction studies the strategy we have used helped in identifying the antigenic epitopes for all proteins used in the study and vaccine construct was analysed for several other parameters like antigenicity allergenicity physicochemical properties which is suited as a candidate vaccine the strategy used in the study has shown in the figure 1
 in the current study we have selected the non-structural proteins of sars-cov-2 which is the responsible for the pandemic covid-19 the sequences of the proteins were retrieved from the ncbi national centre for biotechnology information httpswwwncbinlmnihgov in the fasta format the details of proteins along with their accession numbers and functions has been given in introduction section after the sequence retrieval all the sequences were individually to subjected to pblast server httpsblastncbinlmnihgovblastcgipageproteins to check the homology of the selected viral proteins with human proteome next step was to check the antigenicity of each protein and this was done with the help of antigenpro protein antigenicity prediction server which is a part of scratch protein predicter httpscratchproteomicsicsuciedu after the selection of protein sequences we have predicted the htl epitopes from each protein with the help of immune epitope database and analysis resource iedb httpswwwiedborg server this freely available online server encompasses the experimentally validated data of all the species animals and humans on b-cell and t-cell epitopes perspective to infectious diseases vita et al 2015 for the htl epitope prediction the selected protein sequences were given as input in fasta format the selection of allele was done for the human and the full hla reference set was selected in order to obtain the epitopes prevalent to any geographical region the ctl epitopes for vaccine designing were predicted by using netctl 12 server httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesnetctl this server comprises of two datasets one is of hiv human immunodeficiency virus ctl epitopes and other one is their source proteins the proteins present in the datasets have been cleaved into all probable 9 mers the exception was only for the annotated epitopes and the remaining ones are considered as non-epitopes the protein sequences in fasta has been required as input for the prediction of potential epitopes by using neural networks and weight matrix-based system the server predicted the mhc i binding efficiency of epitopes proteasomal cleavage sites c terminal and tap transport efficiency next the identification of epitopes was constrained to 12 supertypes which are known to enumerate the variance in binding specificities with mhc i class molecules larsen et al 2007 b-cell epitopes in this study have been predicted via abcpred server httpcrddosddnetraghavaabcpred this highly cited and reliable server utilizes machine learning algorithm and artificial neural network ann for the epitope prediction from antigenic sequence the datasets present in this server contains around 700 b-cell as well as 700 non-b-cell epitopes having maximum length of 20 amino acids but it also has the option of selecting the length for predicted epitope 10 12 14 16 and 20 amino acids length saha and raghava 2007 as per recurrent neural network the server has the accuracy of 6593 here we have given the protein sequence as input and set the other parameters threshold 051 and overlapping filter on as default except for amino acid window length which was set as 10 all the selected epitopes were combined together with the help of linkers or spacer sequence of amino acids different linkers have been used to link the b-cell htl and ctl epitopes for instance kk linker was used for making b-cell epitope combinations while aay and gpgpg were used for ctl and htl epitope joining next the adjuvant at the starting of sequence n-terminal was added and then to link the adjuvant epitopes one more linker was used ie eaaak linker after joining all the adjuvant linkers and epitopes in a sequential manner a single potential vaccine candidate was generated the physiochemical properties of the designed covid-19 vaccine construct was predicted with the help of protparam- an expasy server httpswebexpasyorgprotparam this server computes the various parameters of protein sequence which includes theoretical pi molecular weight estimated half-life extension coefficient instability index aliphatic and gravy index for the prediction of antigenicity of the designed construct antigenpro server httpscratchproteomicsicsuciedu share of scratch protein predictor was utilized this is the first server which predicted antigenicity of the entire protein by using experimental proven microarray analysis reactivity data meant for five pathogens this server predicts the antigenicity of protein on the basis of alignment free and manner it is a sequence based pathogen independent server whose predictions are made by five machine learning algorithms and further the antigenic or non-antigenic nature of the protein get finalized by svm support vector machine classifier further the allergenicity of the vaccine candidate was predicted by an online server namely algpred httpcrddosddnetraghavaalgpred and allertop httpswwwddg-pharmfacnetallertop servers the alagpred server predicts the allergenicity on the basis of matching of vaccine sequence against the known epitope sequences saha and raghava 2006 whereas the allertop server utilizes the machine learning techniques which are inclusive of dt decision tree knn k nearest neighbours lr logistic regression mlp multilayer perceptron nb nave bayes rf random forest but among them the five-fold cross validation was only showed by the knn method with the maximum precision of 853 dimitrov et al 2013 along with this toxinpred tool httpcrddosddnetraghavatoxinpred was used to predict the toxicity of the designed vaccine candidate this tool predicts the toxicity of peptides as well as entire protein sequences and accepts the input in fast format and then work on score of position specific basis of quantitative matrix which further identifies the toxicity of the submitted sequence gupta et al 2015 tertiary structure was modelled with the help of raptorx server httpraptorxuchicagoedustructpredv2predict the server compares the input sequence with other nonredundant homologs in order to evaluate the quality of model and then on this basis generates the 3d structure accordingly raptorx server graded second and it works by utilizing cnf conditional neural fields crf conditional random field and mtt multiple template threading which assimilate various biological signals and convert them into a plausible nonlinear scoring function kllberg et al 2014 the refinement of the obtained tertiary structure was done with the help of 3d protein structure refinement server httpsysbiornetmissouriedu3drefine this csap critical assessment of protein structure prediction evaluated server is freely available and demands either the initial structure or protein sequence as input in order to perform the statistical and graphical analysis the server utilizes complete physics and intelligence-based force fields to perform the frequentative optimization of hydrogen bonds and energy minimization bhattacharya et al 2016 after refinement of the 3d structure the quality of model was again verified with the help of qmean qualitative model energy analysis server httpsswissmodelexpasyorgqmean the qmean server evaluates the global and local quality of the structure as input the server requires a 3d model in pdb format or sequence of the protein before proceeding to the submit option user can choose scoring function as per their requirement there are three qmean scoring functions- 1 qmean 2 qmeandisco 3 qmeanbrane the complex qmean scoring function includes two subtypes qmean4 and qmean6 which estimates the quality of complete structure and also for each amino acid by using single pdb model the second one is qmeandisco this also perform the same function as qmean does except calculating the pairwise distance constraints disco between each amino acid residues the last one is qmeanbrane this only evaluates the local quality of models especially for membrane proteins and also show the membrane soluble interface and transmembrane part of the input pdb model benkert et al 2009 at last after the structure modelling refinement and quantitative energy analysis its validation is a very decisive part for the validation purpose we have utilized rampage server httpmordredbioccamacukrapperrampagephp as an input the server requires the pdb structure on protein and then utilizes the quantum mechanics to predict the favoured allowed and disallowed regions the prediction was done on the basis of phi vs psi backbone angles steric clashes hydrogen bond energy planarity of peptide bonds lovell et al 2003 protein-protein interaction between the tlr-3 receptor and vaccine candidate was done with the help of high ambiguity driven protein-protein docking haddock server httpmilouscienceuunlserviceshaddock22haddockserver-easyhtml this server utilized both biochemical bioinformatics and biophysical methods information to improve sampling and scoring of docking results as an input the server requires the active and passive residues from both the receptor and ligand as well as their energy minimized pdb models these interactive residues firstly predicted with the help of cprot server and then used in haddock the server provides the output on the basis of van der waals energy z score desolvation energy rmsd score etc in which the z-score represents the estimation of standard deviation de vries et al 2010 for the dynamical simulation of designed vaccine candidate and tlr-3 receptor in this study we have utilized gromacs groningen machine for chemical simulations v50 programme with the force field gromos96 43a1 this works on the command lines and after the run of program trajectory files were generated which is a time taken process but defines the motion of all the atoms over the time abraham et al 2015 ojha et al 2020 van der spoel et al 2005 before starting the first step in gromacs all the hoh atoms were get removed via pymol software and then input the pdb file to start the first module of gromacs as pdb2gmx after this the topology file of the input protein was generated which have all the specifics about bonded and non-bonded interaction or features after this the next step was of solvation with the help of commands the protein get centred in a box of 10 nm which was then filled with the solvent can be water or any other solvent further the ions na or cl ions were added in the solvation box having the charged protein in order to exchange the hoh molecules with it then prior to md run energy minimization of the protein was done to achieve the lowest energy of the protein subsequently the equilibration of the solvent was done in association with pressure npt and temperature nvt after the stabilization of pressure and temperature ensembles the final md simulation ran for 10ns to positively produce the trajectory files which defines the microscopic movement of the system in this study we have performed an in silico experiment which generates the immune-response for vaccine candidate there is an online dynamic immune simulation server developed by rapin et al namely c-immsim server httpswwwiaccnritfilippoprojectsc-immsim-onlinehtml rapin et al 2010 which uses the sequence of vaccine candidate as an input the advanced c-immsim server which is consistent with earlier version uses the amino acid strings in place of bit strings as per the literature dose interval of 1 month is prescribed for immunization of vaccine though there are some vaccines where the difference can be 2 3 or 6 months between first immunization and first booster dose thus we had chosen the one-month interval and identified the dose dependent immunological response of our vaccine candidate besides the likeliness of the immune response generated by the vaccine in response to pathogen invasion was analyzed through repeated exposure of x following injection doses in each instance one dose was made up of x vaccine molecules where the simulation was conducted for almost x days finally the immune response generated was calculated in the form of simpson index d in general proteome of the sars-cov-2 has both structural and non-structural proteins and after literature survey we came across this point that the non-structural proteins of virus are mainly responsible for their replication in host ojha et al 2019a here in this study we have targeted toolkit of the virus ie the non-structural proteins for vaccine designing recently researchers have reported the study about multi-epitope vaccine against the novel coronavirus and in that they have targeted the structural protein of coronavirus whereas in our current study we have selected the non-structural proteins as they have also been reported as key or potential antiviral drug targets so targeting the already reported drug targets for vaccine designing purpose will be more effective further as per recent survey report it was found that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov both belongs to the same beta coronavirus group with the 70 similarity between their genomes cheng and shan 2020 so targeting the replication machinery proteins of this deadly coronavirus for vaccine designing could be a better way to block the expansion of disease either its sars or covid-19 for the development of immunogenic vaccine we have proceeded by retrieving all the six key proteins from ncbi database apart from this by using pblast server we have checked the homology of all the viral protein with human proteome with this process we came to conclusion that none of the viral protein was showing any kind of sequence identitysimilarity with the human proteins expect helicase protein the helicase protein was showing 224 of identity and 34 query coverage with the zgrf1 isoforms proteins of homo sapiens but as per pearson william 2013 pearson 2013 for the purpose of vaccine designing the sequence similarity between the human and pathogen should not be more than 40 in order to overcome the probabilities of cross reactivity here with this data we can conclude that the non-structural proteins used for vaccine designing will show no cross-reactivity reactions when administered in host also we have checked the antigenicity of all the selected non-structural proteins with the help of antigenpro server the result indicates that the all the proteins were highly antigenic in nature and their sequences can be utilized for the purpose of vaccine designing supplementary table 1 b-cell epitope prediction was done via abcpred server and the obtained epitopes were then finalized on the basis of their ranking and highest score the epitopes with highest score have the highest binding affinity a total six b-cell epitopes were selected one from each protein sequence with the length of 10 mer amino acid each supplementary table 1 this study has utilized the most reliable and validated immunoinformatic servers for the prediction of antigenic epitopes b-cell htl and ctl which are probably conserved across the diverse coronavirus species and expected to recognize the human t-cell and b-cell receptors in order to generate a potential immune response against the covid-19 the immunoinformatic servers provides an easiest way which curtails the experimental effort for the epitope identification in the field of vaccinology many researchers with the help of reverse vaccinology approach have proved the antigenicity of peptide vaccines in contradiction of various infectious diseases dikhit et al 2017 muruato et al 2017 ojha et al 2018 pandey et al 2019 for the identification of antigenic htl epitopes from all the protein sequences iedb server was utilized the epitopes were sorted on the basis on percentile rank which was less than or equal to 09 and ic50 value less than or equal to 50 the lowest percentile rank and ic50 value denotes good binding affinity of epitopes with the hla human leucocyte antigen the next criteria selection of allele was done on the basis of distribution of population in the covid-19 endemic regions in the current study we have tried to cover almost all regions in which covid-19 confirmed cases were reported and total 12 epitopes were selected ie two epitopes from each protein sequence alleles according to their frequency and geographical region has been mentioned in figure 2
 the ic50 value and the percentile rank score of each epitope has been given separately in supplementary file as table 2 the ctl epitopes were predicted via netctl server and at the time of prediction all the parameters were set to default for instance c-terminal cleavage 015 threshold value 075 tap transport efficiency 005 except for supertype selection the hla supertype identification is important for the effective and specified recognition of t-cell epitopes from many viral diseases for instance hiv mmr mers sars etc the supertype selection in this study was done according to the percentage of worldwide population coverage with the help of literature survey we came across that the supertypes a2 a3 and b7 together covers around 88 population globally sette and sidney 1999 shen et al 2018 a total of 18 epitopes were selected three from each protein sequence supplementary table 3 after the prediction of all antigenic vaccine candidates they were joined with each other with the help of linkers in order to generate a single construct however in multi-epitope vaccine each epitope should have the capability to induce the potential immune response and for that linkers are the main factor which are involved in locating the epitopes as well as responsible for the immunogenicity of the entire construct they are also use to discrete the domains in a single protein sequence without distressing the function of protein and helps to maintain a stable and flexible protein complex here in this study we have used different types of linkers to connect the epitopes for instance for linking b-cell epitopes kk yano et al 2005 augmentation of proteasome processing linkers were used while for linking ctl and htl epitopes aay ojha et al 2019b proteasomal cleavage site and avoid the genesis of new epitope and gpgpg livingston et al 2002 for improving the flexibility of protein linkers were availed respectively along with these linkers one more linker was used ie eaaak which has been reported as a helix forming linker in the designing of next-generation vaccine next to acquire more immunogenic construct at the n-terminal of the designed vaccine an adjuvant namely human beta defensin 3 45 amino acids was attached this tlr-3 agonist human beta defensin 3 has been well known to augment the strong t-cell and b-cell immunity gupta et al 2020 mohan et al 2013 after linking of all the epitopes a single immunogenic vaccine candidate of 561 amino acids was created here we have designed the vaccine candidate in this sequential manner- adjuvant-b-cell-htl-ctl in the vaccine sequence the former 45 amino acids were occupied by an adjuvant next 6 amino acids were of eaaak linker and then from number 51-120 amino acids were covered by b-cell epitopes whereas 121-345 and 346-561 were obscured by htl and ctl epitopes respectively supplementary figure 1 the physiochemical properties were computed on the basis of certain parameters such as instability index which was 269 should be less than 40 hence showing the stable nature of the vaccine candidate next on the basis of n-terminal residue n-end rule half-life of the protein was estimated on models like yeast and e coli in vivo mammalian reticulocytes in vitro which denotes that after the synthesis of protein in cell at what time partial amount of the protein will get dissipate as per result we have found that the estimated half-life for the designed vaccine candidate was 30 hours and hence inversely demonstrating that designed vaccine candidate was stale in nature the calculated gravy grand average of hydropathicity score was 0060 and this positive score specifies the highly hydrophobic nature of protein next the aliphatic index of the protein epitomizes the space reserved by aliphatic side chains avil and the calculated score was 8199 the higher aliphatic index denotes highly stable side chains of the protein other calculated parameters have been shown in table 1
 apart from this the average antigenic propensity of the designed vaccine candidate was 10406 which represents the highly antigenic nature of the vaccine according to the antigenpro server high score signifies the more antigenic nature of the protein for the antigenicity prediction algpred server was used and the result obtained from this server was based on the 6 approaches ige mapping mememast motif svm modules based on both amino acid and dipeptide composition blast search on arps and combined approach or hybrid approach which involves all the parameters among these 6 approaches svm modules based on both amino acid and dipeptide composition and hybrid approach identified the vaccine construct as allergenic whereas mememast motif blast search on arps ige mapping approaches identified the construct as non-allergenic so further to cross check this mystery we again checked the allergenicity with allertop server the result from this server exposed the designed vaccine construct as probable non-allergen hence by taking both the results from different servers into consideration we concluded that designed vaccine candidate was probably non-allergen and will not lead to any allergy during pre and post vaccination subsequently with the help of toxinpred server we have checked the toxicity of the epitopes as this server accepts the protein sequences of 500 amino acids and here in this study the designed vaccine candidate was of 561 amino acid so after doing this it was found that all the epitopes involved in the designing of vaccine candidate was non-toxic and will not release any toxic components after administration supplementary table 5a 5b and 5c this above data suggested that the designed vaccine candidate was highly stable antigenic probable non-allergic and non-toxic in nature tertiary structure of the designed vaccine candidate was achieved via raptorx server the tertiary structure of the vaccine candidate was predicted as 2 domains- domain 1 and domain 2 and the best template with id-5cwma was generated and the calculated p-value for the model was 43110-04 the p value represents the quality of the predicted model or structure and value less than 10-3 is a signal of good quality of model it was also found that all the residues 100 of the sequence were modelled and the percentage of disordered region was zero next calculated parameters are of percentage composition of coil helix and beta strands which was 47 16 and 35 respectively figure 3
 the tertiary structure refinement was achieved with the help of 3d refine server as an output the server generated five refined models and the selection of best model was done on the basis of various parameters the model number fifth was selected as its 3d refine score was 404605 which was less than all the other four models additionally the gdt-ts score of the selected model was 09960 whereas the gdt-ha score was 09501 these higher scores denotes the conservative refinement next the rmsd root mean square deviation was 0450 this higher score indicates the aggressive refinement in comparison to initial non-refined one the molprobity score was 3790 and the rwplus potential energy score was -1087363 both lower scores indicate the best quality of model after refinement the quantitative model energy assessment was done with help of qmean server for the estimation of local and global quality of model we have assessed the same by using all the three scoring function options available in qmean server as described in methodology the refined 3d model was given as input and the first estimation was done for qmean4 scoring function which evaluates the global and local model quality as well as global iddt score which is the local distance difference test between per amino acid residue the score obtained by qmean4 server was -725 whereas the global iddt score of the model was 09182 this score should be ranges between 0 and 1 next with the help of qmeandisco scoring function we have predicted the global quality of model the obtained global score was 035  005 this data suggested that the score global local iddt obtained for our model structure was higher and in between the range hence we can conclude that designed model has best scoring and was of exceptional quality figure 4
 subsequently the validation of the refined model was done via rampage server which predicted the  phi and  psi torsion angles of the residues the ramachandran plot assessment provides us the information about the backbone sidechain and geometry of c alpha conformations firstly we have done the analysis of the non-refined vaccine 3d structure and we have found that the favoured region covered 431 residues 771 while the number of residues in the allowed region was 82 147 and for the disallowed region was 46 82 fig 5
asecondly we have generated the ramachandran plot for the refined 3d vaccine structure fig 3 and the graphical representation has showed that the around 461 residues were in the favoured region 825 whereas 64 114 and 34 61 amino acid residues were in allowed and disallowed area of the protein sequence respectively fig 5 this data suggested that the refined vaccine candidate has more stability and flexibility in comparison to non-refined one however the best quality model in rampage should have 98 residues expected in the most favoured region so here we can conclude that the score obtained for the refined 3d model was good then the non-refined one but not the best in this study we have selected tlr-3 receptor for carrying out docking with the designed vaccine candidate covid-19 the role of tlr-3 has already been known in the previous studies of sars coronavirus infection during the sars outbreak in 2015 tortura et al has reported that mice lacking tlr3 and tlr4 are more vulnerable to sars-cov in comparison to mice having tlr3 and tlr4 receptors exceptionally weight loss was observed when exposed to infection but no mortality was detected totura et al 2015 one more rational for the selection of tlr3 was that it mainly recognizes the viruses which have rna as genetic material subsequently after the selection of tlr3 receptor we have proceeded for the docking and the process was done with the help of haddock server in order to illustrate the functioning of ligand molecules which binds to the active site of the receptor as well as to explicate the essential biochemical activities before initializing docking the active and passive residues interactive residues for both the vaccine candidate as well tlr3 receptor has been predicted with the help of cprot server a part of haddock after performing molecular docking we have obtained 8 clusters of the docked complexes and each cluster was composed of 4 best docked complexes according to haadock server calculation the attained top 10 clusters were highly reliable further the docked complex was finalized on the basis of z score and rmsd value table 2
 here we have selected the first best complex of cluster number 1 because the z score denotes standard deviations of the selected complex was -10 which was lowest among all obtained clusters the lowest score always designates the highest binding capacity figure 6
 here are the details of score which we have obtained after performing docking for the accomplishment of highly stable vaccine candidate we have performed the in silico simulation of the docked complex vaccine candidate and tlr-3 receptor with the help of gromacs various steps like energy minimization pressure assessment temperature and potential energy calculations were analyzed after the md simulation study the temperature calculation plot reveal that the system remains persistent at 300 k fig 7
a at around 100 ps time interval whereas in case of pressure the system demonstrates pressure fluctuation with an average value of 1 bar at the same time interval fig 7b the complex root mean square deviation rmsd plot demonstrated the structural stability and flexibility of the docked complex rmsd vs time plot reveals that the primary fluctuation started with 015 nm and completed at 055 nm after 6 ns of a time span and the minor fluctuations were also observed in the docked complex after this the complex reached to its stable position at 6 ns fig 7c next the root medium square fluctuation rmsf was obtained for amino acid side chains in order to analyse the fluctuations of amino acid in the docked complex the rmsf plot reveals minor shifts in amino acid side chains indicating the continuing interaction of the vaccine candidate and the tlr-3 receptor in the rmsf plot the very fluctuated regions indicates the extremely flexible complex and here the higher peaks 100-200 residues and 600-700 residue in the rmsf plot indicate approximately 04 nm suggests that the complex comprises extremely stable extents fig 7d the immune simulation experiment was performed using c-immsim server which gives a real immune response result in our results we have observed the proliferation in secondary and tertian immune response which is identified by igg1  igg2 and igm also while decreasing the antigen count igg  igm also showed the proliferated response in figure 8
a result revealed the immune response development upon immunization b-cell population level was also stimulated and seems to be very high upon immunization figure 8 b likewise in secondary and tertian immune response cell mediated immunity ie the cytotoxic and helper t cells tc  th levels were high figure 8 c  d level of ifn-  was retained during the exposure time which has been shown in figure 8 e these results are significant for the immune response against sars-cov-2 hence the designed vaccine candidate can compete to control the devastating coronavirus outbreak too much to be known about the covid-19 which is spreading through china and claiming thousands of lives featuring the effect of this debilitating outbreak is not feasible because of its rapid spread the recent three outbreaks of coronaviruses in past two decades are different from their common cold causing friends and can spark a fire in individuals body the newly dubbed enemy in the form of virus was initially named as covid-19 by world health organization who and now formally named as sars-cov-2 the virus primarily attacks on respiratory system which involves three major steps replication of the virus hyper-reactivity of the immune system and pulmonary obstruction as per the who the virus makes the perforated holes in the lungs which upon infection give them honey-comb appearance to inhibit the viral infections in human the vaccination is one of the most desirable way herein we have devised a multi-epitope subunit vaccine to elicit the immune response against covid-19 which comprises of an adjuvant ie beta-defensin 3 at n terminal end followed by b-cell epitopes htl epitopes and ctl epitopes connected with appropriate linker sequences the physicochemical parameters of vaccine candidate which includes allergenicity solubility pi hydrophobicity molecular weight gravy half-life indicated its effectiveness the binding specificity of the vaccine candidate with human immune cell receptor ie tlr3 was assessed by molecular docking interaction lowest energy score obtained showed the strong interaction and specificity between vaccine and binding groove of tlr3 receptor our devised vaccine candidate showed the stable and prolonged binding in molecular dynamics simulation with negligible deviation in rmsf and rmsd values additionally immune simulation that mimics the natural environment in computational immunology experiment exhibited the strong immunological response data from the major players of the immunity ie cell mediated t-cell and humoral b-cell at different doses at different intervals for covid-19 multi-epitope subunit vaccine this work provides an innovative vaccine construct against the recent covid-19 outbreak and encourages the development of the vaccine

design using reverse vaccinology and machine learning edison ong mei wong u anthony huffman yongqun he   the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic poses a massive crisis to global public health as of march 11 2020 there were 118326 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths according to the world health organization who and who declared the covid-19 as a pandemic on the same day the causative agent of the covid-19 disease is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 coronaviruses can cause animal diseases such as avian infectious bronchitis caused by the infectious bronchitis virus ibv and pig transmissible gastroenteritis caused by a porcine coronavirus1 bats are commonly regarded as the natural reservoir of coronaviruses which can be transmitted to humans and other animals after genetic mutations there are seven known human coronaviruses including the novel sars-cov-2 four of them hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 have been circulating in the human population worldwide and cause mild symptoms2 coronavirus became prominence after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreaks in 2003 the sars disease caused by the sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov infected over 8000 people worldwide and was contained in the summer of 20033 sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share high sequence identity4 the mers disease infected more than 2000 people which is caused by the mers-associated coronavirus mers-cov and was first reported in saudi arabia and spread to several other countries since 20125 there is no human vaccine on the market to prevent covid-19 and there is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent this highly infectious disease coronaviruses are positively-stranded rna viruses with its genome packed inside the nucleocapsid n protein and enveloped by the membrane m protein envelope e protein and the spike s protein6 while many coronavirus vaccine studies targeting different structural proteins were conducted most of these efforts eventually ceased soon after the outbreak of sars and mers with the recent covid-19 pandemic outbreak it is urgent to resume the coronavirus vaccine research as the immediate response to the ongoing pandemic the first testing in humans of the mrna-based vaccine targeting the s protein of sars-cov-2 clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04283461 table 1 started on march 16 2020 as the most superficial and protrusive protein of the coronaviruses s protein plays a crucial role in mediating virus entry in the sars vaccine development the full-length s protein and its s1 subunit which contains receptor binding domain have been frequently used as the vaccine antigens due to their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies that prevent host cell entry and infection however studies showed that s protein-based vaccination did not provide full protection and sometimes raise safety concerns78 in the meantime many other research groups and companies are also putting great efforts into developing and manufacture covid-19 vaccines in recent years the development of vaccine design has been revolutionized by the reverse vaccinology rv which aims to first identify promising vaccine candidate through bioinformatics analysis of the pathogen genome rv has been successfully applied to vaccine discovery for pathogens such as group b meningococcus and led to the license bexsero vaccine9 among current rv prediction tools1011 vaxign is the first web-based rv program12 and has been used to successfully predict vaccine candidates against different bacterial and viral pathogens1315 recently we have also developed a machine learning approach called vaxign-ml to enhance prediction accuracy16 in this study we first surveyed the existing coronavirus vaccine development status and then applied the vaxign rv and vaxign-ml approaches to predict covid-19 protein candidates for vaccine development we identified six possible adhesins including the structural s protein and five other non-structural proteins and three of them s nsp3 and nsp8 proteins were predicted to induce high protective immunity the s protein was predicted to have the highest protective antigenicity score and it has been extensively studied as the target of coronavirus vaccines by other researchers here we selected nsp3 protein as an alternative vaccine candidate which was predicted to have the second-highest protective antigenicity score yet has not been considered in any vaccine studies we investigated the sequence conservation and immunogenicity of the multi-domain nsp3 protein as a vaccine candidate to better understand the current status of coronavirus vaccine development we systematically surveyed the development of vaccines for coronavirus from the clinicaltrialsgov database and pubmed literature as of march 17 2020 extensive effort has been made to develop a safe and effective vaccine against sars or mers and the most advance clinical trial study is currently at phase ii table 1 it is a challenging task to quickly develop a safe and effective vaccine for the on-going covid-19 pandemic there are two primary design strategies for coronavirus vaccine development the usage of the whole virus or genetically engineered vaccine antigens that can be delivered through different formats the whole virus vaccines include inactivated17 or live attenuated vaccines1819 table 2 the two live attenuated sars vaccines mutated the exoribonuclease and envelop protein to reduce the virulence andor replication capability of the sars-cov overall the whole virus vaccines can induce a strong immune response and protect against coronavirus infections genetically engineered vaccines that target specific coronavirus protein are often used to improve vaccine safety and efficacy the coronavirus antigens such as s protein n protein and m protein can be delivered as recombinant dna vaccine and viral vector vaccine table 2 we first used the vaxign analysis framework1216 to compare the full proteomes of seven human coronavirus strains sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 the proteins of sars-cov-2 were used as the seed for the pan-genomic comparative analysis the vaxign pan-genomic analysis reported only the n protein in sars-cov-2 having high sequence similarity among the more severe form of coronavirus sars-cov and mers-cov while having low sequence similarity among the more typically mild hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 the sequence conservation suggested the potential of n protein as a candidate for the cross-protective vaccine against sars and mers the n protein was also evaluated and used for vaccine development table 2 the n protein packs the coronavirus rna to form the helical nucleocapsid in virion assembly this protein is more conserved than the s protein and was reported to induce an immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections20 however a study also showed the linkage between n protein and severe pneumonia or other serious liver failures related to the pathogenesis of sars21 the vaxign rv analysis predicted six sars-cov-2 proteins s protein nsp3 3cl-pro and nsp810 as adhesive proteins table 3 adhesin plays a critical role in the virus adhering to the host cell and facilitating the virus entry to the host cell22 which has a significant association with the vaccine-induced protection23 in sars-cov-2 s protein was predicted to be adhesin matching its primary role in virus entry the structure of sars-cov-2 s protein was determined24 and reported to contribute to the host cell entry by interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace225 besides s protein the other five predicted adhesive proteins were all nonstructural proteins in particular nsp3 is the largest non-structural protein of sars-cov-2 comprises various functional domains26 the vaxign-ml pipeline computed the protegenicity protective antigenicity score and predicted the induction of protective immunity by a vaccine candidate16 the training data consisted of viral protective antigens which were tested to be protective in at least one animal challenge model27 the performance of the vaxign-ml models was evaluated table s1 and figure s1 and the best performing model had a weighted f1-score of 094 using the optimized vaxign-ml model we predicted three proteins s protein nsp3 and nsp8 as vaccine candidates with significant protegenicity scores table 3 the s protein was predicted to have the highest protegenicity score which is consistent with the experimental observations reported in the literature the nsp3 protein is the second most promising vaccine candidate besides s protein there was currently no study of nsp3 as a vaccine target the structure and functions of this protein have various roles in coronavirus infection including replication and pathogenesis immune evasion and virus survival26 therefore we selected nsp3 for further investigation as described below the multiple sequence alignment and the resulting phylogeny of nsp3 protein showed that this protein in sars-cov-2 was more closely related to the human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov and bat coronaviruses btcovhku3 btcovhku4 and btcovhku9 we studied the genetic conservation of nsp3 protein figure 1a in seven human coronaviruses and eight coronaviruses infecting other animals table s2 the five human coronaviruses sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 belong to the beta-coronavirus while hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 belong to the alpha-coronavirus the hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 as the human coronavirus with mild symptoms clustered together with murine mhv-a59 the more severe form of human coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov grouped with three bat coronaviruses btcovhku3 btcovhku4 and btcovhku9 when evaluating the amino acid conservations relative to the functional domains in nsp3 all protein domains except the hypervariable region hvr macro-domain 1 mac1 and beta-coronavirus-specific marker sm showed higher conservation in sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov figure 1b the amino acid conservation between the major human coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov was plotted and compared to all 15 coronaviruses used to generate the phylogenetic of nsp3 protein figure 1b the sars-cov domains were also plotted figure 1b with the relative position in the multiple sequence alignment msa of all 15 coronaviruses table s3 and figure s2 the immunogenicity of nsp3 protein in terms of t cell mhc-i  mhc-ii and linear b cell epitopes was also investigated there were 28 and 42 promiscuous epitopes predicted to bind the reference mhc-i  mhc-ii alleles which covered the majority of the world population respectively table s45 in terms of linear b cell epitopes there were 14 epitopes with bepipred scores over 055 and had at least ten amino acids in length table s6 the 3d structure of sars-cov-2 protein was plotted and highlighted with the t cell mhc-i  mhc-ii and linear b cell epitopes figure 2 the predicted b cell epitopes were more likely located in the distal region of the nsp3 protein structure most of the predicted mhc-i  mhc-ii epitopes were embedded inside the protein the sliding averages of t cell mhc-i  mhc-ii and linear b cell epitopes were plotted with respect to the tentative sars-cov-2 nsp3 protein domains using sars-cov nsp3 protein as a reference figure 3 the ubiquitin-like domain 1 and 2 ubl1 and ubl2 only predicted to have mhc-i epitopes the domain preceding ubl2 and pl2-pro dpup domain had only predicted mhc-ii epitopes the pl2-pro contained both predicted mhc-i and mhc-ii epitopes but not b cell epitopes in particular the tm1 tm2 and ah1 were predicted helical regions with high t cell mhc-i and mhc-ii epitopes28 the tm1 and tm2 are transmembrane regions passing the endoplasmic reticulum er membrane the hvr mac2 mac3 nucleic-acid binding domain nab sm nsp3 ectodomain 3ecto y1 and cov-y domain contained predicted b cell epitopes finally the vaxign rv framework also predicted 2 regions position 251260 and 329337 in the mac1 domain of nsp3 domain having high sequence similarity to the human mono-adp-ribosyltransferase parp14 np0600242 our prediction of the potential sars-cov-2 antigens which could induce protective immunity provides a timely analysis for the vaccine development against covid-19 currently most coronavirus vaccine studies use the whole inactivated or attenuated virus or target the structural proteins such as the spike s protein nucleocapsid n protein and membrane m protein table 2 but the inactivated or attenuated whole virus vaccine might induce strong adverse events on the other hand vaccines targeting the structural proteins induce a strong immune response202930 in some studies these structural proteins including the s and n proteins were reported to associate with the pathogenesis of coronavirus2131 and might raise safety concern a study has shown increased liver pathology in the vaccinated ferrets immunized with modified vaccinia ankara-s recombinant vaccine32 although there were no other adverse events reported in other animal studies the safety and efficacy of these vaccination strategies has not been tested in human clinical trials our study applied the state-of-the-art vaxign reserve vaccinology rv and vaxign-ml machine learning strategies to the entire sars-cov-2 proteomes including both structural and non-structural proteins for vaccine candidate prediction our results indicate for the first time that many non-structural proteins could be used as potential vaccine candidates the sars-cov-2 s protein was identified by our vaxign and vaxign-ml analysis as the most favorable vaccine candidate first the vaxign rv framework predicted the s protein as a likely adhesin which is consistent with the role of s protein for the invasion of host cells second our vaxign-ml predicted that the s protein had a high protective antigenicity score these results confirmed the role of s protein as the important target of covid-19 vaccines however the s protein exists in many coronaviruses and many non-pathogenic human coronaviruses also use s protein to cell invasion for example despite markedly weak pathogenicity hcov-nl63 also uses s protein and employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cellular entry33 this suggests that the s protein is not the only factor determining the infection level of a human coronavirus in addition targeting only the s protein may induce high serum-neutralizing antibody titers but cannot induce sufficient protective efficacy34 thus alternative vaccine antigens may be considered the sars-cov-2 nsp3 protein was predicted to be a potential vaccine candidate as shown by its predicted second-highest protective antigenicity score adhesin property promiscuous mhc-i  mhc-ii t cell epitopes and b cell epitopes the nsp3 is the largest non-structural protein that includes multiple functional domains to support viral pathogenesis26 the multiple sequence alignment of nsp3 also showed higher sequence conservation in most of the functional domains in sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov than in all 15 coronavirus strains fig 1b the induction of nsp3-specific immunity would likely help the host to fight against the infection besides the s and nsp3 proteins our study also suggested four additional vaccine candidates including 3cl-pro nsp8 nsp9 and nsp10 all these proteins were predicted as adhesins and the nsp8 protein was also predicted to have a significant protective antigenicity score our predicted non-structural proteins nasp3 3cl-pro nsp8 nsp9 and nsp10 are not part of the viral structural particle and none of the non-structural proteins have been evaluated as vaccine candidates the sarsmerscovid-19 vaccine studies so far target the structural smn proteins still the non-structural proteins have been used effective vaccine antigens to stimulate protective immunity against many viruses for example the non-structural protein ns1 was found to induce protective immunity against the infections by flaviviruses35 the non-structural proteins of the hepatitis c virus were reported to induce hcv-specific vigorous and broad-spectrum t-cell responses36 the non-structural hiv-1 gene products were also shown to be valuable targets for prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines37 therefore it is reasonable to consider the sars-cov-2 non-structural proteins as possible vaccine targets as suggested by the present study instead of using a single protein as the vaccine antigen we would like to propose the development of a cocktail vaccine as an effective strategy for covid-19 vaccine development a typical cocktail vaccine includes more than one antigen to cover different aspects of protection3940 the licensed group b meningococcus bexsero vaccine which was developed via reverse vaccinology contains three protein antigens9 to develop an efficient and safe covid-19 cocktail vaccine it is possible to mix the structural eg s protein and non-structural eg nsp3 viral proteins the other proteins identified in our study may also be considered as possible vaccine targets the benefit of a cocktail vaccine strategy could induce immunity that can protect the host against not only the s-ace2 interaction and viral entry to the host cells but also protect against the accessary non-structural adhesin proteins eg nsp3 which might also be vital to the viral entry and replication the usage of more than one antigen allows us to reduce the volume of each antigen and thus reducing the induction of adverse events nonetheless the potentials of these predicted non-structural protein targets in vaccine development need to be experimentally validated for rational covid-19 vaccine development it is critical to understand the fundamental host-coronavirus interaction and protective immune mechanism7 such understanding may not only provide us guidance in terms of antigen selection but also facilitate our design of vaccine formulations for example an important foundation of our prediction in this study is based on our understanding of the critical role of adhesin as a virulence factor as well as protective antigen the choice of dna vaccine recombinant vaccine vector and another method of vaccine formulation is also deeply rooted in our understanding of pathogen-specific immune response induction different experimental conditions may also affect results4142 therefore it is crucial to understand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for rational vaccine development we annotated peer-reviewed journal articles stored in the pubmed database and the clinicaltrialsgov database from the peer-reviewed articles we identified and annotated those coronavirus vaccine candidates that were experimentally studied and found to induce protective neutralizing antibody or provided immunity against virulent pathogen challenge the sars-cov-2 sequence was obtained from ncbi all the proteins of six known human coronavirus strains including sars-cov mers-cov hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were extracted from uniprot proteomes43 the full proteomes of these seven coronaviruses were then analyzed using the vaxign reverse vaccinology pipeline1216 the vaxign program predicted serval biological features including adhesin probability44 transmembrane helix45 orthologous proteins46 and protein functionss1216 the ml-based rv prediction model was build following a similar methodology described in the vaxign-ml16 specifically the positive samples in the training data included 397 bacterial and 178 viral protective antigens pags recorded in the protegen database27 after removing homologous proteins with over 30 sequence identity there were 4979 negative samples extracted from the corresponding pathogens uniprot proteomes43 with sequence dis-similarity to the pags as described in previous studies4749 homologous proteins in the negative samples were also removed the proteins in the resulting dataset were annotated with biological and physicochemical features the biological features included adhesin probability44 transmembrane helix45 and immunogenicity50 the physicochemical features included the compositions transitions and distributions51 quasi-sequence-order52 moreau-broto auto-correlation5354 and geary auto-correlation55 of various physicochemical properties such as charge hydrophobicity polarity and solvent accessibility56 five supervised ml classification algorithms including logistic regression support vector machine k-nearest neighbor random forest57 and extreme gradient boosting xgb58 were trained on the annotated proteins dataset the performance of these models was evaluated using a nested five-fold cross-validation n5cv based on the area under receiver operating characteristic curve precision recall weighted f1-score and matthews correlation coefficient the best performing xgb model was selected to predict the protegenicity score of all sars-cov-2 isolate wuhan-hu-1 genbank id mn9089473 proteins downloaded from ncbi a protein with protegenicity score over 09 is considered as strong vaccine immunity induction weighted f1-score  094 in n5cv the protein nsp3 was selected for further investigation the nsp3 proteins of 14 coronaviruses besides sars-cov-2 were downloaded from the uniprot table s2 multiple sequence alignment of these nsp3 proteins was performed using muscle59 and visualized via seaview60 the phylogenetic tree was constructed using phyml61 and the amino acid conservation was estimated by the jensen-shannon divergence jsd62 the jsd score was also used to generate a sequence conservation line using the nsp3 protein sequences from 4 or 13 coronaviruses the immunogenicity of the nsp3 protein was evaluated by the prediction of t cell mhc-i and mhc-ii and linear b cell epitopes for t cell mhc-i epitopes the iedb consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 4 out of 27 mhc-i reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 10 score50 for t cell mhc-ii epitopes the iedb consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to more than half of the 27 mhc-ii reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 100 the mhc-i and mhc-ii reference alleles covered a wide range of human genetic variation representing the majority of the world population6364 the linear b cell epitopes were predicted using the bepipred 20 with a cutoff of 055 score65 linear b cell epitopes with at least ten amino acids were mapped to the predicted 3d structure of sars-cov-2 nsp3 protein visualized via pymol66 the predicted count of t cell mhc-i and mhc-ii epitopes and the predicted score of linear b cell epitopes were computed as the sliding averages with a window size of ten amino acids the nsp3 protein 3d structure was predicted using c-i-tasser67 available in the zhang lab webserver httpszhanglabccmbmedumicheduc-i-tasser2019-ncov  a

mitigate the dispersion and impact of infectious disease polio was a serious crippling disorder for decades until the development of two separate vaccine candidates by jonas salk and albert sabin melnick 1996 from the time of the first polio outbreak in the united states to testing and development was almost 60 years4 figure 2 more recently a vaccine for the lethal infectious hemorrhagic fever elicited by ebola disease took on a substantially different timeline with development by a canadian team jones et al 2005 preceding the worst outbreak in western africa in 2014 with the disease first described in isolated cases in 1976 taking into account the prolonged development and testing phases it still took at least 15 years figure 2 for authorized clinical use of an ebola vaccine5 looking at the other coronavirus disease-causing outbreaks sars and mers that led to regional epidemics in various countries the impetus was strong initially to develop vaccines but fizzled out with their spontaneous resolution although vaccine candidates were brought forward for both sars-cov-1 and mers and projects continue there are still no approved vaccines for either infectious agent 17 and 6 years respectively de wit et al 2016 song et al 2019 since the original outbreaks figure 2 in view of this the bar is set high for developing an effective vaccine targeting covid-19 will sars-cov-2 go the same direction as the other coronaviruses or will it become a seasonal outbreak like influenza and persist as a moderately benign to severe nuisance-causing infectious disorder that lasts for years given the worldwide magnitude of the covid-19 pandemic and comparisons to the great spanish flu of 1918 the race for a vaccine candidate has taken on unprecedented urgency and commitment across

barriers in an attempt to reduce the time from the usual 10 years for an approved vaccine down to 1218 months cepi the biomedical advanced research and development authority10 barda gavi the vaccine alliance11 formerly global alliance for vaccines and immunization various governments and other sources are either pouring money into the efforts to fund projects or providing logistical support with additional initiatives one such initiative is the strategic alliance activ12 accelerating covid-19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines a public-private initiative bringing together more than a dozen leading biopharmaceutical companies the cdc centers for disease control and prevention fda us food and drug administration and ema european medicines agency to develop an international strategy for a coordinated research response to the covid-19 pandemic another massive undertaking to expedite the process is operation warp speed13 which includes scientists pharmaceutical companies and us federal officials and is being compared to the manhattan project14 what does the ideal vaccine look like for covid-19 prevention in clinical terms three main factors are essential i a robust immune response generating long-lasting neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov-2 antigens eg s andor n is imperative figures 1 and 3 when individuals are infected with foreign antigens on viruses they evoke both innate and adaptive immune reactions with a coordinated antigen-presenting cell apc attack on the virus and t-helper cell activation that leads to b-lymphocytes producing antibodies in this context ideally the antibodies will directly interfere with sars-cov-2s knack for latching onto epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes via ace2 figure 1 in order to neutralize the virus this would curtail successfully the virus from infecting the host and be protective if an infection resulted however there remains critical shortfalls in the current knowledge of what comprises a protective immune response against covid-19 and how long it lasts as of may 2020 ii the ideal sars-cov-2 vaccine will also induce potent t-lymphocyte immunity ideally this would be a well-coordinated orchestrated t-cell response that includes t-helper and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte subsets that recognize sars-cov-2 infected cells in the body and annihilate them to block viral replication along with acquisition of memory t-cells to prevent reinfection months to years later iii the candidate vaccine should limit any serious adverse events saes at the injection site or systemically for example fever in infants and young children in the case of respiratory disorders caused by infectious agents it is essential that vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease vaerd antibody-dependent enhancement ade antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc complement-dependent cytotoxicity including cytokine storm-inducing effects are completely avoided graham 2020 hotez et al 2020 vardhana and wolchok 2020 some of these clinical sequelae have been associated with past vaccines in development figure 3 with a prominent example that for respiratory syncytial virus rsv during the late 1960s graham 2020 since the virus apparently activates complement deposition in small blood vessels of some infected individuals magro et al 2020 blocking adverse host responses is essential complement inflammation and coagulation systems are intertwined oikonomopoulou et al 2012 and hyperactive in covid-19 positive cases and the vaccine should not provoke these host response systems in logistical terms there are a few essential parameters for the ideal candidate vaccine for covid-19 i the vaccine should be easy to administer and preferably in a single dose at the lowest possible amount an oral or intranasal vaccine would be ideal ii the vaccine should be facile to produce and scale-up manufacturing millions to billions of doses required to immunize the human population must be feasible and rapid iii long-term storage of the vaccine at room temperature should be a sought after goal to facilitate transport and stockpiling in underdeveloped nations with inadequate supply chains and cold chain capacities figure 3 the ideal vaccine targeting covid-19 would fit into a proposed target product profile as described in table 1 the normal strides taken to achieve successful vaccine development are similar to those for any drug the process should be very stringent seeing that it will culminate in administration of the vaccine candidate to billions of humans the typical paradigm is depicted in figure 3 and is explained in the legend the scientific publications to date ahn et al 2020 amanat and krammer 2020 caddy 2020 callaway 2020a callaway 2020b cohen 2020 chen wh et al 2020 kim et al 2020 lurie et al 2020 thanh le et al 2020 wang f et al 2020 wu 2020 as well as databases mentioned above have various formats for classifying vaccine platforms in our analysis we consider seven main platforms of vaccine development along with an eighth catch-all other category figure 4 there are two nucleic acid platforms dna 12 candidates and rna 20 candidates which could be sub-divided further according to particular traits related to delivery and carriers eg electroporation with special devices intradermally vs oral formulation or lnps vs exosomes but for simplicity are considered only as two categories these nucleic acid platforms belong to the new generation of vaccines neither has reached licensing for human use but a number are being tested in humans cohen 2020 a third category termed protein-based also referred to as subunit vaccine includes a broad range of technologies to prepare immune-stimulating viral protein antigens and represents the largest category of all current covid-19 vaccine candidates currently 44 in development like nucleic acids protein-based vaccines represent a newer technology but some are already in use in the clinical realm eg gardasil for human papillomavirus the fourth and fifth categories are viral-based vectors similar to those used in gene therapy and include nonreplicating 16 candidates and replicating 14 candidates vectors the next two are the sars-cov-2 viruses themselves either inactivated usually with a chemical such as -propriolactone which chemically inactivates enveloped viruses and can inhibit viral membrane fusion in a dose-dependent mannergao et al 2020 or in a live-attenuated version generated by techniques such as codon deoptimization or serial passaging in cell culture mueller et al 2020 the other category includes virus-like particles vlps the use of nonsars-cov-2 virus carriers such as killed rabies coravax and live modified horsepox tx-1800 there are 10 in this category repurposed existing vaccines for polio or tuberculosis to evoke general immunity various cellular immunotherapies to stimulate the host immune system encapsulated convalescent serum and unknown platform designation listed in the milken institute database are excluded from our analyses figure 4 according to these criteria there are over 125 sars-cov-2 vaccines in development which is astounding from all across the globe in such a short time-frame for the ideal covid-19 vaccine to reach routine use in humans it is imperative that the vaccine protects against both clinical disease and viral transmission in order to break the chain of person-to-person pandemic spread some of the advantagesdisadvantages of each platform are considered in table 2 in this section we provide some specific details on 16 of 125 vaccines in the pipeline that are registered for clinical trials or already being tested as of may 25 2020 in addition to those that are currently cepi- andor barda-sponsored from each platform that are or not yet in clinical trials this is to provide a snapshot of the field in early endeavors to procure a functional sars-cov-2 vaccine in man and their proposed developmental

publications pubmed 22000 papers reached such exponential heights in such a short period with thousands of all-things-considered covid topics mobilization of data sharing and joint global efforts toward this vaccine goal are monumental it is hoped that the collaborative framework such as activ and others around the world for prioritizing vaccine and drug candidates streamlining clinical trials coordinating regulatory processes andor leveraging assets among various partners to rapidly respond to the covid-19 and future pandemics will soon be a reality however a successful path forward will be challenging and is certainly not guaranteed for instance no efficacious and approved vaccine for hivaids has come forward in over 30 years the main hiv surface protein for host cell entry is covered in sugars as is the spike protein of sars-cov-2 but to a lesser extent watanabe et al 2020 will this site-specific glycan shield provide difficulties in target antigen recognition if not properly reconstituted in some of the vaccine platforms will it be necessary to target more than just the spike protein which most approaches are banking on cryptic epitopes for antibody recognition need to be considered yuan et al 2020 and multivalent formulations may be required to generate effective long-lasting immunity with the ideal target product profile table 1 sars-cov-2 antibody-based

companies that have the skill to be able to do it are not going to just sit around and have a warm facility ready to go for when you need it said anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at nih usa and a member of the white house coronavirus task force at a panel discussion florko 2020 he has been aware of the mood of vaccine-manufacturing big pharma which has not changed much since the 1980s and is largely driven by a few very pertinent questions will the demand fade away with the end of the outbreak will the people choose sometimes due to foolish reasons of vaccine hesitancy not to use the product what would be the timeline to reach breakeven and create wealth with negligible prospects for profits most drug makers have been neglecting emerging infectious disease areas however due to the present spread of the covid-19 pandemic which has claimed at the time of writing this article 217192 lives and infected 3117204 individuals so far across all the continents except antarctica the need for vaccines have rekindled new interests and with a higher enthusiasm johns hopkins university 2020 this can be understood from the rapidity in response to contain the outbreak and designing modalities for treatment according to reports from institute pasteur shanghai the first notice on treatments provided for pneumonia from hospitals in wuhan china was received on 30th december 2019 within 8 days the coronavirus was identified and by 10th january 2020 the very first genome of the virus was shared by the university of sydney on behalf of the chinese academy of sciences fontanet 2020 huang et al2020 consequent to that a number of efforts are being made to socially contain the outbreak screen available drugs for repurposing for covid-19 and design specific vaccines against the new coronavirus this review highlights the genomic features of coronavirus that should be considered for vaccine design current innovations in vaccine technology global efforts and future challenges in vaccine developments for covid-19 covid-19 is a new infectious disease of the respiratory tract with chances of developing fulminant pneumonia similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and is caused by the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 which spreads through contact with respiratory droplets from nose and mouth chan et al2020 who 2020a notably 80 of people who are exposed or infected do not develop the active disease and show mild symptoms of seasonal flu and recover without major treatment however its estimated rate of incidence is much higher and is in the range of 2060 in comparison with 8 for flu and initial observations concludes that those developing severe disease require hospitalization for a period twice as much as that for acute flu lenski 2020 it originated in the hubei province of china in late 2019 and spread rapidly around the world through human-to-human transmission along the international air-travel routes the case fatality rate for covid-19 at the time of writing this article stands at 10 times more than 01 as reported for the seasonal flu lenski 2020 sars-cov-2 is the third member of the pathogenic coronavirus after sars-cov and mers-cov causes the middle east respiratory syndrome that shows severe pathology in humans among few others that only cause mild clinical symptoms like the flu cui et al2019 in the absence of a clinically proven effective treatment regime current therapies for covid-19 mainly receive supportive care supplemented by different combinations of anti-retroviral drugs a few fda approved drugs and immune therapies are being repurposed and currently in clinical trials at several stages and available only on compassionate grounds they have been proven efficacious in controlling sars influenza hiv and the ebola virus replication by either targeting the viral rna polymerase or the poly-protein protease or by boosting host immunity as adjunct therapy harrison 2020 convalescent plasma from recovered individuals and monoclonal antibody therapies which showed some success during the ebola outbreak in western africa are being developed van griensven et al2016 these antibodies will also form the basis for the serological diagnosis of asymptomatic spreaders which are absent at the moment however here we will restrict our discussion to the multiple vaccines being developed against sars-cov-2 from the entire initial set of five genome sequences available it was concluded that the new coronavirus is 999 identical among themselves suggesting its recent entry into humans zhou et al2020 all the 3365 viral genomes known today form a tight cluster based on phylogeny and show evidences of only 20 mutational events much lower than the expected rate of 104 substitutions per site per year this slow evolution is despite carrying rna as the genome and much to the advantage for vaccine researchers dong et al2020 the closest match with 8896 overall identity is that of the bat-derived beta-coronaviruses indicating a zoonotic origin of the disease similar to sars and mers but genetically distinct from the respective coronaviruses andersen et al 2020 interestingly genomic and evolutionary evidence places the coronavirus found in malayan pangolins pangolin-cov as the next best match with greater than 91 identity thus hinting at the anteater as a possible intermediate host to the new coronavirus after spillover from bats like the palm civets and the dromedary camels in case of sars-cov and mers-cov respectively zhang et al2020 further the study posits pangolins-cov as the possible common ancestor for the human and bat versions based on the key amino acid residues present in its surface protein and crucial for interaction with the host receptor recombination events among the small sub-genomic regions are very common in coronaviruses due to the high level of co-infection that exists in their hosts therefore tracing the evolutionary history of coronaviruses can be quite challenging and debatable its positive-strand rna genome consists of six major open reading frames and accessory genes coding for the typical non-structural proteins including the rna-dependent rna polymerase proteases and the structural proteins including the matrix m envelope e spike s and nucleoprotein n the surface spike s glycoprotein is responsible for binding to the human cell surface receptor followed by membrane fusion and entry figure 1 de wit et al2016 this spike protein is also pivotal for determining host specificity estimating the capacity of disease transmission and for production of neutralizing antibody in human generally the spike protein of coronaviruses consists of a signal peptide extracellular trans-membrane and intracellular regions the host-recognizing extracellular domain responsible for cell membrane fusion is divided by a polybasic cleavage site into a receptor binding s1 domain and the s2 domain andersen et al 2020 when it comes to sequence identity at the amino acid level which determines molecular recognition to the host receptor the s1 domain shows only 68 identity in comparison with the bat version expectedly phylogenetic analysis also places the receptor binding domain to a lineage closer to that of the sars-cov version thus suggesting a binding to the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 lu et al2020 zhou et al2020 further it underscores the emergence and reservoirs of sars-cov-2 which originated from bats but may have jumped into pangolins with a plausible long period of natural selection in human or human-like ace-2 the receptor binding domain appears to have accumulated mutation at five amino acid positions for optimizing binding to host following an early zoonotic transfer much before november 2019 andersen et al2020 an educated speculation indicates that a covid-19-type epidemic may recur at any time in the future by a different sars-cov-2 variant evolving from the early isolates under selective pressure in animals further emphasizing the need for a vaccine vaccination strategies can be effectively used to reduce disease severity control transmission by viral shedding and prevent future infections vaccines are usually directed to induce both arms of the adaptive immune response producing neutralizing antibody that prevents attachment to host cells and activate the bodys t killer cells that recognize and kill infected cells vaccine candidates are chosen from the various approaches available as per the level of protection required the simplest method involves introducing a virus into the body after inactivation by chemicals gamma irradiation or heat proteins expressed on the dead viral surface serves as antigen and induce the production of neutralizing antibodies as in the case of the early polio vaccine figure 1 bandyopadhyay et al2015 another method involves introducing weakened or attenuated versions of the virus that slowly replicates inside the host cell but provides enough viral antigen to induce an immune response like the oral polio vaccine rabies vaccine or the bcg vaccine given at birth to prevent childhood tuberculosis administering a non-virulent organism is less safe than the inactivated virus and has been the cause for disease outbreak but is much superior in terms of establishing a mild infection necessary for mounting a successful adaptive immune response afrough et al2019 developing an attenuated vaccine in a short time is however challenging as it requires isolating a non-virulent strain through several rounds of time-consuming sub-culturing in the laboratory and requires adequate knowledge about the virulence factors expressed by the coronavirus furthermore the level and type of adaptive immune response sometimes depend on the strain used in the product one each of the above types is currently under preclinical development to estimate efficacy and toxicity formaldehyde-inactivated formulation is being developed by sinovac biotech in china while a genetically modified poorly replicating coronavirus is being developed in a partnership between codagenix usa and serum institute of india india using their proprietary deoptimization technology platform earlier used for developing vaccines for zika dengue and influenza who 2020b a more targeted approach involves inducing adaptive immunity by introducing immunogenic viral proteins or their fragments to generate both antibodies and cell-mediated immune response delivering the antigenic epitopes with optimal levels of antigen presentation required for a broad protective immunity is vital for a successful immune response the high degree of similarities in the genome structural proteins and even the host attachment receptor indicates the existence of a possible similarity in the immune responses against the two sars coronaviruses this also means that conclusions made from studies on sars-cov proteins might help in determining the immunogenic determinants required for vaccine development in addition to the high level of potent antibodies against the s and n proteins of sars-cov which were incidentally short-lived strong t-cell responses that provide long term protections were detected for the same structural proteins tang et al2011 intriguingly when the experimentally identified dominant b-cell and t-cell epitopes of sars-cov were mapped to the amino acid sequence of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins 27 t-cell epitopes matched the sars-cov-2 proteins without a single mutation further the epitopes located within the predicted receptor binding domain of the spike protein were associated with the most prevalent major histocompatibility complex mhc alleles in the human population ahmed et al2020 similarly a large number of b-cell epitopes found complete sequence identity with that of the nucleocapsid protein and both s1 and s2 domains of the spike protein the prevalence of epitopes corresponding to the less exposed s2 domain however indicates its possible access to antibodies post attachment to the host cell this analysis also helps preclude the apprehensions about the mismatches observed in the receptor binding region of the s1 domain from the structural analysis of the spike protein wrapp et al2020 antibodies raised against the s2 domain of sars-cov spike protein may cross-react and neutralize sars-cov-2 thus positing an excellent opportunity for repurposing the candidate monoclonal antibodies that did not cross phase i trials for sars vaccine development tian et al2020 therefore the spike protein of sars-cov can be confidently placed as the most potent antigenic determinant against which candidate vaccines should be developed 
another important consideration in designing vaccines particularly in case of rna viruses that generally have higher mutation rates is the antigenic drift or genetic variability which plays a pivotal role in choosing the best genome sequence of the viral strain for vaccine development and this means we need to sequence the sars-cov-2 genome from as many regions possible from around the world dong et al2020 choosing the right vaccine candidate is as much an art as a science since finding the viral components that will not trigger severe inflammation but can provide a protective immune memory is not trivial more so when nothing much is known about the immune pathology of the disease and the immune evasion strategies employed by the virus to evade the host defense and most of our assumption is based on studies conducted on sars-cov since a virus is an obligate intracellular replicative entity that requires the host cell for its proliferation all vaccine strategies are aimed at preventing the attachment of the virus to the host cell at the molecular interface this recognition is characterized by binding of the viral surface protein spike glycoprotein in sars-cov-2 to the receptor on human cells ace2 lu et al antibodies generated against the surface protein antigen helps to neutralize this receptor binding thus making protein subunit vaccines very popular however by themselves these proteins would normally be unstable and may lose their molecular structure soon after injection rendering it difficult for the immune cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus furthermore the free-floating viral protein may change its shape to a post-recognition stable conformation which is very different from the pre-recognition state as displayed on the surface of the virus the molecular clamping approach uses joining key structural polypeptides at several regions in the protein structure to efficiently retain the original shape of the immunogenic epitopes thus stimulating a stronger response uniquest 2014 with advances made in understanding the replication and pathogenesis of a wide variety of viruses along with the development of tools for genetic manipulation it is now possible to generate safer attenuated vaccines expressing recombinant viral protein antigens from a proxy infection model robert-guroff 2007 replicating vectors in use includes adenovirus measles virus poxvirus and vesicular stomatitis virus vsv humphreys and sebastian 2018 these viruses are either non-pathogenic in humans vsv or carry a genetically modified genome which neutralizes their virulent nature the coding sequence for the required proteinsubunit antigen is attached to the genome for optimal expression assembly and packaging into the recombinant virus two major advantages underscore their potential as a vaccine of choice its ability to elicit a complete innate and adaptive immune response that is also tunable in terms of type and intensity of the response is its biggest advantage the proxy natural infection model employed also allows the induction of co-stimulatory immune molecules that provide an adjuvant effect second its replicative nature allows achieving similar protection at a 34 log lower dosage vectors based on measles virus have been considered for vaccines against hiv-aids and sars due to its potential to provide lifelong immunity as a result of its ability to infect the antigen-presenting cells dendritic cells and macrophages zuniga et al2007 in this case the genes essential for replication of the adenovirus are deleted among others from the adenoviral genome and replaced with antigenic protein coding genes at the locus robert-guroff 2007 the most popular modified vaccinia virus ankara mva is a natural attenuated version of poxvirus through repeated sub-culture in chicken cells mva has lost its ability to replicate and evade immune surveillance in human cells kennedy and greenberg 2009 replication-deficient vectors can accommodate larger gene inserts and also provide stability in terms of not regaining virulence when compared with the replication-competent versions one of the problems of using the protein subunit vaccine has been presenting the antigen in its most stable and effective conformation vlps are composed of multiple structural proteins which upon recombinant expression have the ability to self-assemble into nanostructures enclosing the capsid proteins within itself syomin and ilyin 2019 the vlps can have a lipid envelope originating from the cell membrane producing them in the form of budding and can also be chimeric in nature displaying an envelope protein from another virus a wide range of production platforms expressing and correctly folding the antigenic proteins are available in bacterial and yeast systems insect and mammalian cell lines and even in transgenic plants in addition since vlps lack a genome of its own they offer a similar level of stability as non-replicating vectors thus offering the safety of subunit vaccine and efficacy of the live-attenuated vaccine together nucleic acidbased vaccines have emerged as a better alternative to live and inactivated vaccines for treatments against emerging pathogens as the dna expressing the pathogens protein can be produced in a short time this does not involve growing the virus in the laboratory and gives equivalent protective immunity as other forms in this case the dna sequence is introduced often facilitated by nano-carriers directly to the cells of a specific tissue once they make their way into the nucleus with the help of a targeting sequence viral surface protein production driven from an optimized promoter is outsourced to the host cells natural machinery hobernik and bros 2018 dna vaccines are safe stable and large quantities can be produced in a short time through cost-effective manufacturing processes which is crucial for distribution in low-income regions first identified while studying immunization with tumor antigens for cancer therapy mrna vaccines are now extensively studied for emerging pathogens like dna vaccines they represent the new generation therapies and being mrna in nature avoid the risk of being integrated into the host genome as a bonus they come in two flavors traditional mrna-based vaccines and self-amplifying mrna vaccines both work on the strategy of using the host cell transcription machinery to produce the target proteins and induce adaptive immunity pardi et al2018 while the former is replication-deficient and contains the antigens mrna the latter codes for a modified genome of an rna virus where the target antigen of choice replaces the viruses native genes coding for the structural proteins the resulting virus can express the heterologous antigenic genes in the cytoplasm in high numbers but cannot package itself into a functional virus while the mrna can amplify itself using the rna dependent rna polymerase coded in its genome geall et al2012 all of the above innovations are being rapidly utilized to develop multiple vaccines against the new coronavirus several epidemiological models predict that the present pandemic will stay for quite some time albeit in several small pockets around the world and reappear in the subsequent waves of infection but will coronavirus usher in a new era in developing innovative vaccines for emerging infectious disease beyond covid-19 we will have to wait for the results of the clinical trials to come out vaccine development for infectious diseases is equally challenging similar to drug development and normally takes the same amount of time in the case of covid-19 this is even harder because of unknown disease pathogenesis unavailability of a validated animal model and success is dependent on the human clinical trials despite all this the scale and severity of the current pandemic have attracted around 35 companies  big pharma small biotechnology firms and university spinoffs  to develop a vaccine against sars-cov-2 lee 2020 who 2020b thanks to the attractive funding from two government agencies of the usa biomedical advanced research and development authority department of health usa and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases national institutes of health usa work has been initiated on as many as 44 candidate vaccines table 1 which are currently in clinical and preclinical stages the covid-19 outbreak has also highlighted innovations in funding mechanism through the involvement of coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi a global alliance-based vaccine accelerator for emerging infectious diseases founded in 2017 by the governments of india and norway with initial support from the world economic forum and philanthropic organizations like the bill and melinda gates foundation usa and wellcome trust uk this generous funding has enabled several small biotechnology firms and academic institutions to triage their diverse candidates which is essential in situations where it is hard to predict which one and at which stage will reach a cul-de-sac the new candidates are not only based on traditional approaches they are also being built on the existing vaccines and leveraging on platforms used to develop the sars or the mers vaccines it is important to mention that although there are great similarities between the immunogenic epitopes of the two sars-covs vaccines for covid-19 do not have to be similar to the ones proposed against other coronaviruses the newly developed vaccine against the ebola zaire virus by glaxosmithkline uk was produced using the adenoviral vectors used for an hiv vaccine gsk 2016 institute pasteur has proposed to use the measles vaccine virus vector backbone used earlier to prepare vaccines for ebola zika and lassa fever who 2020b phase i trials for toxicity and immunogenicity have started on healthy adult volunteers with funding from cepi for a lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mrna vaccine mrna-1273 co-developed by nihs virus research centre niaid and moderna inc another frontrunner in starting the clinical trials is cansino biologics in partnership with chinas academy of military medical sciences institute of biotechnology this candidate is based on a non-replicating adenoviral vector used for ebola while university of oxfords jenner institute has proposed to start phase i trial for a non-replicating adenoviral vector-based vaccine backbone chadox1 due to its proven efficacy among older people with underlying co-morbidities devlin 2020 among others candidates that are undergoing preclinical testing are mrna-based vaccines from germanys curevac funded by european union and cepi and biontech co-developed with pfizer both companies are repurposing their leads from personalized cancer treatments to deliver vaccines that are tunable as per the level of immune response required curevac 2020 pfizer 2020 like moderna another american company novavax has redeveloped a spike proteinbased vaccine for sars in combination with its proprietary matrix adjuvants institute pasteur is leading a consortium with university of pittsburgh and themis biosciences austria to work on a replicating measles vaccine virus vector technology based on sars-cov pasteur institute 2020 with the availability of a high-resolution molecular structure of the trimeric spike protein researchers at the university of queensland australia are using their disruptive molecular clamp technology which helps the viral proteins to maintain their shape thus enabling the immune system to mount a stronger response university of queensland 2020 it is being combined with glaxosmithklines proprietary adjuvants in order to generate a long-lasting immune response a lower adjuvanted dose allows immunization of a larger number of individuals with a low amount of the protein product the same adjuvant-based potentiation is also being offered for clover biopharmaceuticals trimeric spike protein vaccine candidate a very promising and widely discussed dna vaccine candidate ino-4800 being developed by inovio pharmaceuticals has succeeded in raising funds from cepi although dna-based vaccines have not received any regulatory approvals in the past and the company has not delivered any vaccine since its inception it has committed to start clinical trials in april 2020 and has received support from the bill and melinda gates foundation to develop an intradermal electroporation device for vaccine delivery linnane 2020 intriguingly large-scale phase iii randomized control trials have started in australia and netherlands to check for the effectiveness of the bcg vaccine a live-attenuated strain of mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis in cattle in reducing incidences and disease severity among the healthcare workers exposed to sars-cov-2 byrne 2020 this recent development stems from a report which claimed to have found an excellent correlation on country-wise severity of covid-19 symptoms to its national immunization program for protection against childhood tb and tb meningitis miller et al 2020 it is also not surprising to note that countries practicing compulsory bcg vaccination are also socio-economically backward therefore reports of low morbidity and mortality from covid-19 may be related to low co-morbidities contributed by lifestyle diseases and not necessarily a protection offered by bcg vaccination the study draws a link between high mortalities in iran which started bcg vaccination later in 1984 with the lack of non-specific protection among the older population the non-specific protection by bcg against viral infections is plausibly offered by the induction of innate immune memory again a very new concept in itself that results in enhanced production of immune modulators and cytotoxic activity of immune cells nevertheless if true this might help to provide some levels of protection until a new specific vaccine is made available moorlag et al2019 however it would be interesting to learn about the outcome of these large trials with respect to the degree of protection achieved as different strains of bcg is known to provide a wide range of efficacies in the case of tuberculosis in adults usually it takes 1015 years of development through the classical path using inactivated or live attenuated vaccines after generating long-term efficacy data during the ebola emergency this time was brought down to 5 years for candidates that are based on viral vector vaccines and involved running a few key steps of phase ii trials in parallel as the covid-19 contagion rapidly engulfs a quarter of the worlds population inovio pharmaceutical has ambitiously accelerated this timeline to publish the human clinical trials data by the fall of 2020 which is remarkably less than a year inovio pharmaceuticals 2020 this is also expected keeping in mind that there might not be enough patient volunteers available to participate in the human trials later however the test cohort should not miss out on including different age groups ethnicity gender and pregnant women finally data needs to be collected for any rare occurrence of immunization-mediated enhancement of severe illness after infection this is primarily caused by the development of sub-neutralizing antibodies which promotes excessive viral entry to the host cells wan et al2020 however when it comes to manufacturing and delivery the process faces myriad of new challenges as often experienced by the pharmaceutical industry large quantities of the candidate vaccine are generally required to start a full-scale phase iii trial and immunizations thereafter moreover each product will require a customized scale-up technology that will have to be developed more and more pharmaceutical companies have shifted focus to the risk-averse lifestyle disease and this has resulted in their losing the skillset and expertise required for vaccine development this needs to be re-built by continuous financial commitments with no immediate guarantee for rewards and an unprecedented level of international cooperation which is thankfully quite visible another important question that may arise and needs some clarity is selecting the target cohort for immunization healthier individuals might be naturally protected and more vulnerable while the needy older population might show problems of a poor immune response and require higher doses certainly healthcare workers need them the most in our preparedness for the next wave of infection and perhaps also the traders in the wet markets if they continue to be in business in conclusion once we have the vaccine and hopefully the apex of the pandemic is over an effective policy needs to be carefully prepared to develop a global access framework for equitable distribution in the developing world while protecting intellectual property and market rights distribution of the vaccines should be made as far as possible based on humanitarian benevolence centrally through international agencies including global alliance for vaccines and immunization gavi unicef and who allowing the vaccine producing countries or the richest economies to stockpile the doses for the native population in the absence of a national emergency as seen in the case of h1n1 influenza virus vaccine in 2009 will jeopardize all the momentum gained thus far fidler 2010  vaccines for covid-19 the current state of play archana koirala ye jin joo ameneh khatami clayton chiu philip britton n   covid-19 is the disease caused by a novel betacoronavirus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 the disease was first reported in december 2019 wuhan china 1 and the full genome was sequenced and published by january 05 2020 2 by march 11 2020 covid-19 had spread globally and was declared a pandemic with at the time of writing june 6th 2020 there has been over 6 million people infected and 380000 deaths 3 the disease primarily affects the respiratory tract and disease severity can range from very mild rhinorrhoea to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and death 4 5 6 a substantial minority of infections are asymptomatic non-respiratory symptoms such as anosmia diarrhoea rash thromboembolic disorders myocarditis and vasculitis have also been associated with covid-19 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 the median incubation period is estimated to be 5 days with a majority developing symptoms by 115 days 14 covid-19 patients have been shown to excrete viral nucleic acid at highest levels at the onset of symptoms 15 this and other epidemiological data 16 suggests transmissibility within an as yet undefined pre-symptomatic period 16 clinical deterioration is usually delayed into the second week of illness and associated with laboratory features of an immune-mediated cytokine storm causing widespread inflammation and disseminated intravascular coagulation usually with low level viraemia 17 18 the case fatality rate death amongst persons with disease is consistently reported to be age dependent with a higher percentage in elderly aged 70 years cases dying although other factors are also associated with intensive care admission and mortality 9 6 19 including sex malefemale hypertension obesity and diabetes the reported case fatality rates cfr have been between 082 and 964 with variability in cfr likely due to the testing frequency and access as well as other health system capacity factors in different locations 20 the infection fatality rate ift death amongst all people infected  asymptomatic and not tested is a better estimate of population mortality and is modelled to be between 01 to 041 20 sars-cov-2 is one of three coronaviruses that may cause severe respiratory diseases including fatality in humans and have been associated with major outbreaks in the last 20 years the other two viruses being severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov sars-cov and mers-cov mers-cov although there were some development of vaccines against sars and mers including a small number of human phase 1 clinical trials there are no licenced vaccines for any coronavirus as yet in addition to these novel epidemic viruses with zoonotic origins there are four other endemic human coronaviruses in circulation hcov2-229e -hku1 -nl63 and -oc43 all predominantly causing mild symptoms of the common cold 21 coronaviruses have a large 30 kb single-stranded positive sense rna genome encased by a helical nucleocapsid n and an outer envelope comprised of matrix protein m envelope protein e and spike proteins s 22 the s protein which naturally occurs in a trimeric form contains the receptor-binding domain rbd responsible for binding onto the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and entry into the cell figure 1
 in sars-cov of all the structural proteins s protein was found to elicit neutralising antibody and is a major target antigen for vaccine development 23 24 there have been difficulties in the development of coronavirus vaccines historically coronavirus vaccines in animal models that mimic human disease have been immunogenic but generally not shown to effectively prevent acquisition of disease 25 further there is a concern that vaccination as with natural coronaviral infection may not induce long lived immunity and re-infection may be possible 26 in some ways more concerning has been vaccine associated disease enhancement previous use of coronavirus vaccines sars-cov and mers-cov in some animal models raised safety concerns regarding th2 mediated immunopathology 27 mice vaccinated with two inactivated whole virus vaccines a recombinant dna spike protein vaccine or a virus-like particle vaccine developed lung pathology including eosinophilic infiltration 2 days after being challenged with sars-cov which were not seen in the lungs of challenged unvaccinated mice 28 similar lung immunopathology was observed in several other studies particularly in aged mice compared to younger mice 29 that were challenged following vaccination 30 31 mice immunised with sars-cov n protein vaccine developed severe pneumonia or lung eosinophilic infiltrate upon viral challenge whereas mice immunised with viral replicon particles expressing glycoprotein did not suggesting that the n protein antigen may be the antigen linked to this immunopathology similar enhanced immunopathology has been seen in mice vaccinated with inactivated mers-cov vaccine when challenged with live virus 32 vaccine associated disease enhancement may be more of a concern with certain vaccine types enhanced disease caused by viral challenge has been notable following administration of inactivated measles and rsv vaccines 33 34 with the possible mechanisms being a th2 skewed response resulting from formalin inactivation as well as lack of affinity maturation of the antibodies produced 35 developing and scaling-up mass production of a vaccine rapidly in a global pandemic setting is challenging as it requires many activities to be well-coordinated and occurring in parallel in contrast to the usual decade long sequential process with pre-clinical testing phased clinical trials planned production and distribution these challenges result in an aggregation of invested resources and elevated financial risk 36 in outbreaks delay in vaccine distribution can result in considerable mortality and morbidity as illustrated by the 20132014 west african ebola epidemic which killed more than 11000 people 37 and resulted in economic and social burden costing over 53 billion dollars 38 tragically a vaccine had been in development and was later shown to be effective in the prevention of ebola and may have contributed to controlling the outbreak 39 40 unfortunately the sars 2003 epidemic ended before vaccine development was complete disappointingly funding agencies then reallocated funds that had been committed to vaccine development leaving manufacturers with financial loss and setting back other vaccine development programs 36 in 2017 the coalition of epidemic preparedness innovation cepi was formed to address these past failures with a mission to develop a coordinated response to emerging infectious disease threats to ensure vaccine development and early deployment in response to epidemics 41 one method for overcoming road blocks has been to through the use of new technology platforms to expedite vaccine development 42 vaccines licensed in humans have traditionally been live attenuated viruses eg measles mumps rubella inactivated viruses eg inactivated polio vaccine protein or polysaccharide conjugated subunit vaccines protein acellular pertussis hepatitis b polysaccharide conjugated pneumococcus meningococcus and virus-like particles over the last decade a range of new technology platforms have been developed and include vaccines composed of nucleic acid dna and rna and viral vectors and recombinant proteins viral vector technology involves the delivery of one or more genes that encode a target antigen within an unrelated engineered virus the viral vector can be replication competent live attenuated or replication deficient for hiv ebola zika and chikungunya vaccines using viral vectors including adenovirus ad measles virus mv vesicular stomatitis virus vsv alphaviruses poxviruses and herpesviruses allowing for insertion of 5 kb or more of the transgene have shown ability to stimulate cellular and humoral immunity 43 42 concerns with this platform are with the likely slower speed of vaccine manufacturing in an outbreak setting given the need for biosafety level 2 bsl2 laboratories and possible pre-existing immunity in vaccine recipients to viral vectors such as ad5 and mv decreasing the effectiveness of the vaccine approaches such as the selection of low human prevalence adenoviral serotypes ad26 or ad35 have been used to circumvent such an issue 43 42 the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-zaire ebola virus rvsv-zebov ebola vaccine is currently the only vector-vaccine that has been licensed and available for human use and only produced and used to a limited extent 44 45 46 a mers-cov vaccine mva-mers-sdf1 using modified vaccinia virus ankara and expressing the spike s protein of mers-cov was evaluated in an open label phase 1 trial on 26 individuals aged 18-55 it showed a favourable safety profile without any severe adverse effects but induced only a relatively limited humoral and t-cell response to the mers cov 47 reassuringly the study showed that although vector specific neutralisation antibody was elicited the vaccine still elicited antibody responses against the transgene following booster immunisation 47 results of the phase 1 clinical trial for an alternate vaccine chadox1 mers vaccine that uses a replication deficient simian adenoviral vector expressing the spike s protein in 24 individuals aged 18-50 years showed that a single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against mers cov the majority of solicited and unsolicited adverse events aes reported by participants were mild or moderate and all were self-limiting and there were no serious aes related to vaccine administration which supports progression into phase 1b and 2 trials 48 nucleic acid vaccines utilize antigen-encoding plasmid dna or rna messenger rna mrna or viral replicons the nucleic acid once taken up by a cell will initiate protein synthesis to which a humoral and cell-mediated immune response is expected to occur similar to natural infection such vaccines have been trialled for veterinary infectious diseases and demonstrated immunogenicity for example for foot and mouth disease deer powassan virus and rabies virus 49 50 51 phase i trials in humans are underway for nucleic acid vaccines against ebola influenza and zika virus 42 the benefit of a nucleic acid platform is the ease with which it allows antigen manipulation and the speed of production as manufacturing can be synthetic and entirely cell free so circumventing the need for bsl2 laboratories the disadvantages are that nucleic acid especially mrna are fragile and require an uninterrupted cold-chain process for transport and storage 52 phase i clinical trials have been conducted on sars-cov and mers-cov dna vaccine candidates a recombinant sars dna vaccine candidate coding for the sars-cov n protein genome developed by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid was investigated in 10 adults 53 a mers-cov dna vaccine gls-5300 developed by geneone life scienceinovio and coding for the full length s protein genome had a higher number of participants n75 54 both showed acceptable safety profiles and induced humoral and cellular responses the mers-cov dna vaccine has advanced into a phase 2 clinical trial 55 the only other sars vaccine to have entered a phase i trial is an inactivated vaccine iscv produced by sinovac biotech 56 there were no reports of human studies in which vaccinated subjects were challenged by the natural virus as of 1st june 2020 there are currently 124 candidate vaccines that are under development for prevention of covid-19 listed by the who health organization who landscape summary 57 of which 10 candidate vaccines specifically designed for prevention of covid-19 table 1
 have entered phase 1 combined phase 12 or phase 2 human clinical trials in adults most of these trials are enrolling healthy adults from age 18 years only with the upper age limit of inclusion ranging from 50 to 60 years two trials are enrolling young participants one from aged 3 years and the other 6 years with no upper age limit in both one combined phase iii trial includes older adults up to age 85 years while another early phase i trial has been extended in may 2020 to include also older adults to age 99 years 58 59 licensed vaccines such as bcg and oral polio vaccine have been shown to have nonspecific modulatory effects on the immune system and provide protection against other infectious diseases 60 61 62 63 64 this has led to the suggestion that these vaccines may have an effect in the prevention of covid-19 65 three multi-centred randomised controlled trials on bcg vaccine administration are underway in health care workers in australia 66 netherlands 67 and south africa 68 a measles vaccine trial to prevent covid-19 in health care workers in egypt has been registered 58 and oral polio vaccines are being considered in the united states of america 69 even if sustained immunity is attained after infection by sars-cov2 estimates are that 60-70 of a population would need to be immune to achieve herd immunity against sars-cov2 70 the safest and most controlled way for effective and sustainable prevention of covid-19 in a population is to have an efficacious and safe vaccine and the majority of the population successfully vaccinated in addition the vaccine should also be readily mass-produced inexpensively and be easily transportable with minimal cold chain requirements to have global utility immunity after primary covid-19 infection seems to protect against re-infection in primate models and is likely to occur in humans 71 whether this can be mimicked in vaccines and for how long immunity may last is still uncertain following sars-cov infection igg and neutralising ab was detectable for 1 to 3 years following infection which suggests that vaccine-induced protection is unlikely to be long-lasting and may require re-immunization 72 73 74 75 the rapid progression of new vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 into pre-clinical and clinical studies is encouraging several phase 1 trial results have recently been released ad5-cov vaccine conducted in 108 participants showed reasonable safety or tolerability profile and has now progressed to phase ii humoral and cell mediated responses were seen in participants albeit less in those with pre-existing ad5 vector immunity 76 interim phase 1 data released on may 18 on mrna-1273 demonstrated seroconversion and development of neutralizing antibodies in 8 individuals 77 it is an open question of whether these candidates will display the necessary efficacy and safety profile in humans to progress further into phase 3 trials and subsequently licensure and use to control covid-19 transmission in a review of 11 epidemic infectious diseases only 1 out of 11 21 preclinical vaccine candidates have been shown to go through to end of phase 2a trials at the estimated cost of usd 319-469 million range 137 million to 11 billion 78 in the current climate some vaccine developers are have shown willingness to start or progress later phase trial preparations even before definitive results of earlier phase trials are available 79 there have been international collaborative efforts to expedite vaccine development and production the prior establishment of cepi has been an integral existing platform that has supported the rapid development of covid-19 vaccines without having to establish new mechanisms with attendant costs cepi is supporting the nine covid-19 vaccine candidates briefly presented here since its formation it has established measures to finance early development of vaccines up to phase 3 clinical trials however it does not have a role in the manufacturing or deployment of vaccines and a consortium of public and philanthropic funders will be required for complete preparedness for vaccine manufacture and delivery in addition to cepi the who and the us national institutes of health nih are contributing to global collaborative efforts to accelerate vaccine development the who solidarity trial for vaccines is a large multi-site individually randomised controlled clinical trial to allow evaluation of the benefits and risks of each covid-19 candidate vaccines within 36 months 80 further accelerating covid-19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines activ an international public-private partnership has been established to co-ordinate and speed up the response to the covid-19 pandemic government organisations in the us and one in europe international biopharmaceutical companies and a non-profit organisation are all involved in advancing vaccine development 81 vaccine efficacy in under-represented and vulnerable populations also remains an issue a majority of vaccine trials have focused on healthy people between the ages of 18-65 years excluding the elderly pregnant women and children given the disproportionate mortality rate in people over the age of 60 the elderly need to be considered in vaccine trials to ensure safety immunogenicity and efficacy data is collected and are prioritised to receive covid-19 vaccines in outbreak situations pregnancy has not been shown to be a risk factor for disease severity and the disease burden is low in children however much is still unknown especially the role of inducing an adaptive auto-inflammatory response such as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with sars-cov-2 pims-ts there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of covid-19 to give guidance to the immunological assessment of vaccine responses there has never been a more rapid pace to vaccine development the pandemic situation has been a challenge and a trigger to reconsidering the usual approaches to regulatory assessment and licensing processes vaccine companies are showing willingness to commit to scaled-up production prior to definitive phase 3 trial results 79 the implementation of high quality aligned surveillance for covid-19 across multiple regions concurrently with vaccine deployment is critical both for evaluating the real-world effectiveness of a new vaccine against sars-cov-2 but also for monitoring its safety in so-call post-marketing surveillance the association of rotavirus vaccines with intussusception in children was only detected following licensure and deployment of these vaccines 82 83 the experience of the philippines with a novel dengue vaccine should also promote a degree of caution with respect to vaccine safety during their population usage even if they appear safe in phase 1 2 and 3 studies 84 85 there will be considerable uncertainties regarding the safety of vaccines for covid-19 given the new vaccine platforms used without prior licensed examples deployment to population subgroups not included in trials of that particular candidate additional uncertainty arising from novel adjuvants in quite a number of candidates as we have alluded to the development of a vaccine that shows efficacy in clinical trials is only the beginning of a process to manufacture deploy and monitor the effectiveness of a new vaccine the challenges ahead are numerous as an example in 2016 as part of the global poliovirus eradication initiative gpei 155 countries were planned to synchronously shift from trivalent oral polio vaccine topv to bivalent vaccine bopv 86 this switch was to be coordinated with concurrent inclusion of at least 1 dose of inactivated polio vaccine ipv into routine immunization schedules in 126 opv using countries significant difficulties have been encountered with vaccine manufacturing and supply chains resulting in interruptions and delays in multiple countries 87 this experience will certainly inform and improve a potential global covid-19 vaccine deployment but should influence a level of caution with respect to our expectations even were an effective vaccine developed despite efforts in fast tracking vaccine development completion dates for early clinical trials are estimated to be late 2020 to mid-2021 and it may still take longer before a vaccine is licensed for use globally although the pandemic has triggered reconsideration of the usual approaches to regulatory assessment and licensing this emphasises the need for proven public health strategies such as physical distancing early detection self-isolation and outbreak control remain as important mitigation tools the reader will be able tounderstand of the types of

  balancing expediency and scientific rigor in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine development kevin graepel w sonali kochhar ellen clayton w kathryn edwards e   over the last 5 months the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has precipitated a global health and economic crisis dramatically altering the daily lives of billions of people rapid community transmission of sars-cov-2 has been enabled in part by its biology and its novelty humans have no preexisting immunity to this brand-new human pathogen and we are all susceptible to infection though not uniformly likely to develop symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in the short term social distancing measures are decreasing community transmission but are exacting enormous costs from individuals and businesses leading prominent voices to call for lifting restrictive measures however as relatively few people are immune to sars-cov-2 covid-19 cases will almost certainly surge if normal activities resume the only long-term way to control sars-cov-2 is for most people to become immune to the virus so that herd immunity slows down spread one way to achieve the needed level of protection is for the virus to sweep through the population at the cost of extensive casualties far better would be developing and deploying a safe and effective vaccine to generate widespread immunity with dual goals of protecting individuals and controlling the pandemic the covid-19 pandemic has triggered an explosion of potential vaccine candidates and calls for their rapid and widespread deployment prompting discussions about the risks of advancing unvetted vaccines into the general population fortunately the process of vaccine licensure is designed to ensure vaccine safety and efficacy particularly since vaccines are given to healthy people who might never be exposed to sars-cov-2 or develop severe disease the most effective way to identify and deploy efficacious sars-cov-2 vaccines with acceptable safety profiles is through carefully designed scientifically rigorous clinical trials conducted at an accelerated pace recent technological advances in vaccine design and global commitments to addressing epidemic diseases have provided a rich infrastructure to support the necessary response to covid-19 the moderna messenger rna vaccine currently being studied in the united states was administered to the first human subject just 63 days after the sars-cov-2 genetic sequence was released from china this achievement was facilitated by the acceptable human safety profiles of similar vaccine constructs targeting other diseases including zika and avian influenza seven other vaccine clinical trials have started in the united states united kingdom germany and china and the list of preclinical vaccine candidates now is 100 1 2 it is not yet clear whether sars-cov-2 infection results in durable protective immunity by what mechanism it might do so and whether vaccine-elicited immune responses will protect without causing harm early studies are promising up to 95 of mild covid-19 cases induce some level of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 3 and nonhuman primates infected with sars-cov-2 are protected from reinfection with the virus 4 survivors of infections with related coronaviruses sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov developed neutralizing antibodies that persisted for 13 years after infection phase 1 studies of dna vaccines for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov were well tolerated and immunogenic in humans 5 6 these reports suggest that sars-cov-2 vaccines could safely induce protective immune responses and it seems likely that 1 or more of the 108 candidate vaccines in development will be ultimately licensed yet there is reason for caution as the experience in animal models is inconclusive some sars-cov-1 and mers-cov vaccine candidates appear to exacerbate illness in animals after subsequent viral challenge 7 such vaccine-enhanced disease harks back to respiratory syncytial virus rsv and dengue vaccines that caused harm the mechanisms underlying enhanced disease remain controversial but certain patterns have emerged detrimental responses were more common but not ubiquitous after immunization with whole-inactivated sars-cov-1 and mers-cov vaccines 810 perhaps due to immune responses against the nucleocapsid protein 11 not present on the viral envelope or to chemical modifications that alter epitopes or antigen processing 12 however a new whole-inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine reportedly induced neutralizing antibodies and protected rhesus macaques from viral challenge without overt safety concerns 13 given the association of whole-inactivated vaccines with enhanced disease one might expect that vaccine platforms delivering isolated spike protein present on the viral envelope could elicit protective immunity without provoking immunopathology indeed protein and dna vaccines can induce strong neutralizing antibody responses against sars-cov-1 and mers-cov 14 15 accordingly many sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates are designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against the sars-cov-2 spike 1 however antisars-cov-1 spike antibodies elicited by a vaccinia vector were shown to worsen lung injury in chinese macaques postchallenge potentially through infection and proinflammatory reprogramming of macrophages 16 this study along with several other reports suggests a role for antibody-dependent enhancement ade through cell-surface fc receptors 1619 the probability of ade varies with antibody concentration 17 19 suggesting that its effects might appear late after vaccination and highlighting the need for long-term follow-up in clinical studies many of the harmful immune responses to prior coronavirus vaccine candidates appear to hinge on the balance between the type of helper t-cell response in general th1 responses are thought to promote protective immunity while th2 responses stimulated by adjuvants such as alum are associated with eosinophils in the lungs of experimental animals 7 pulmonary eosinophilia was a prominent feature of enhanced disease associated with an rsv vaccine 12 but th2-like responses to sars-cov-1 can be protective despite eosinophilic histopathology 9 th1- and th2-type inflammatory responses also influence antibody isotype repertoire and subsequent interactions with fc receptors 20 potentially modifying the risk of antibody-induced immunopathology manipulating the balance of th1 and th2 responses through adjuvants such as toll-like receptor agonists and delta inulin may reduce the risk of vaccine-enhanced disease 8 20 overall the mechanisms underlying the immunopathology of coronavirus vaccines and the differences among vaccine candidates and animal models remain poorly understood potential factors include the vaccine itself the viral strain used for challenge the animal model and the timing and dose of both vaccine and challenge identifying the basis for immunopathology will be important for optimizing vaccine candidates ordinarily unresolved questions about coronavirus immunology might have been answered before human clinical trials now however delays in developing a safe and effective vaccine will cost lives we thus need to carefully weigh decisions about study duration follow-up and clinical and biological monitoring to comprehensively obtain the information needed to assess the safety of sars-cov-2 vaccines early studies should be performed in healthy adults who are fully informed about areas of uncertainty regarding risks and human challenge studies are an intriguing but controversial approach to assessing efficacy and safety 21 these considerations are especially important since many candidate vaccine platforms are novel and have not yet yielded licensed vaccines standardized metrics of immunogenicity efficacy and safety should be coordinated at an international level to ensure that vaccine studies can be directly compared and to promote accountability among research teams and private developers the world health organization has an important role in this process experts convened by the brighton collaboration working with the center for epidemic preparedness innovations supported the conduct of ongoing vaccine studies and advocated for standardized safety assessments of local and systemic reactions they also recommended measuring potential biomarkers of vaccine-enhanced disease which may include the ratios of neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies antibody isotypes and affinities proinflammatory cytokine levels and the polarity of t-cell responses 7 ongoing therapeutic trials using convalescent sera should examine the conditions under which infection-derived antibodies are protective in addition animal studies should continue concurrently to resolve unanswered questions about immunogenicity and immunopathology concerning results in any experimental system should prompt rapid reconsideration of related clinical trials the research community is making unprecedented advances toward rapidly developing sars-cov-2 vaccines this is a laudable goal and scientists regulators and clinicians must remain steadfast against pressure to bypass the established scientific ethical and regulatory standards in an attempt to accelerate vaccine availability our community must push forward in generating high-quality reliable data while we strive to save lives  advanced in silico tools for designing of antigenic epitope as potential vaccine candidates against coronavirus asheesh shanker mehak dangi rinku kumari bharat singh anil chhillar kumar   coronaviruses are remarkably large positive-stranded rna viruses that are enveloped with the nucleocapsid having helical symmetry the corona in coronavirus is a latin word that means a crown and it indicates to the typical presentation of virions underneath electron microscopy with a periphery of hefty globular surface projections similar to that of a crown coronavirus is a pathogen associated with severe respiratory symptoms and was first identified from the nasal cavities of sufferers with the common cold in the early 1960s de groot et al 2013 brown et al 2012 these were named human coronavirus oc43 and human coronavirus 229e a total of 40 sequenced genomes of different strains of coronavirus are accessible from national center for biotechnology information ncbi out of which 7 are pathogenic to humans a coronavirus ie sars-cov was responsible for outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in the year 2003 whereas middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov caused the most recent outbreak in 2012 causing acute respiratory disease in affected people with signs of fever cough and difficulty in breathing after first reported from saudi arabia in 2012 this novel virus has also dispersed to other countries like the united states and was known to have high death rate mers-cov infections are highly communicable and no explicit antiviral cure has been designed for it till date azhar et al 2017 it compelled us to apply the well-known reverse vaccinology rv approach on available proteome of coronavirus rv approach has been successfully applied on many prokaryotes but there are very few known applications on eukaryotes and viruses so it is worthwhile to explore the potential of this approach to identify potential vaccine candidates for coronavirus rv basically does the in silico examination of the viral proteome to hunt antigenic and surface-exposed proteins this approach was initially applied successfully to neisseria meningitidis serogroup b kelly and rappuoli 2005 against which none of the prevailing techniques could develop a vaccine the present book chapter is intended to explore the potential of rv approach to select the probable vaccine candidates against coronavirus and validate the results using docking studies undoubtedly the traditional approaches for vaccine development are fortunate enough to efficiently resist the alarming pathogenic diseases of its time however the traditional approach suffers from certain limitations like it is very time-consuming the pathogens which cant be cultivated in the lab conditions are out of reach and certain non-abundant proteins are not accessible using this approach rappuoli 2000 consequently a number of pathogenic diseases are left without any vaccine against them all these limitations are conquered by reverse vaccinology approach utilizing genome sequence information which ultimately is translated into proteins hence all the proteins expressed by the genome are accessible irrespective of their abundance conditions in which they expressed the credit of fame of reverse vaccinology should go to the advancements in the sequencing strategies worldwide accordingly improvement in the sequencing technologies has flooded the genome databases with huge amount of data which can be computationally undertaken to reveal the various crucial aspects of the virulence factors of the concerned pathogen reverse vaccinology is based on same approach of computationally analysing the genome of pathogen and proceeds step by step to ultimately identify the highly antigenic secreted proteins with high epitope densities the best epitopes are selected as potential vaccine candidates pizza et al 2000 this approach has brought the unapproachable pathogens of interest in spotlight and is evolving as the most reassuring tool for precise selection of vaccine candidates and brought the use of peptide vaccines in trend sette and rappuoli 2010 kanampalliwar et al 2013 bexsero is the first universal serogroup b meningococcal vaccine developed using rv and it has currently earned positive judgement from the european medicines agency gabutti 2014 whether it is discovery of pili in gram-positive pathogens which were thought to not have any pili or the sighting of factor g-binding protein in meningococcus alessandro and rino 2010 the reverse vaccinology steals all the credits from other conventional approaches most of the applications of rv are against prokaryotes and very few against eukaryotes and viruses because of complexity of their genome corynebacterium urealyticum guimares et

et al 2014 and brucella melitensis vishnu et al 2017 are the examples of some pathogens that are recently approached using this in silico technique in order to spot some epitopes having potential of being a vaccine candidate herpesviridae bruno et al 2015 and hepatitis c virus hcv kolesanova et al 2015 are the examples of the viruses that are addressed using this approach the proteome of

peptides are known to impact the immune responses and possess high epitope densities moreover most of the known vaccine candidates also possess signal peptides hence it is worthwhile to predict signal peptides in proteins prior to epitope predictions signal-blast web server is used to predict the signal peptides without any false predictions httpsigpepservicescamesbgacatsignalblasthtml frank and sippl 2008 the prediction options include best sensitivity balanced prediction best specificity and detect cleavage site only we choose to make the predictions using each option and the proteins predicted as signal peptide by all the four options were preferred for further investigation the most appropriate targets as vaccine candidates are those which possess the adhesion-like properties because they not only mediate the adhesion of pathogens proteins with cells of host but also facilitate transmission of virus adhesions are known to be crucial for virulence and are located on surface which makes them promptly approachable to antibodies the stand-alone spaan with a sensitivity of 89 and specificity of 100 was used to carry out the adhesion probability predictions and the proteins with having adhesion probabilities higher than or equal to 04 were selected sachdeva et al 2004 betawrap motifs are dominant in virulence factors of the pathogens if the proteins are predicted to possess such motifs then they are appropriate to be taken under reverse vaccinology studies betawrap server is the only online web server to make such predictions the proteins having p-value lower

hla-a0201 using cluspro httpclusprobueduloginphp kozakov et al 2017 that is an automated protein-protein docking web server the literature searches provided the information of conserved residues of the receptor site the default parameters were used for docking comeau et al 2004a b kozakov et al 2006 a total of 40 different sequenced strains of coronavirus are available at ncbi among them 7 strains are pathogenic to humans various information regarding source host and collection of these strains are presented in table 151 and 152 this information can be obtained from ncbis genome database the virus pathogen database and analysis resource and genomes online database liolios et al 2006 pickett et al 2012 the mers strain is taken as seed genome as it is the most prevalent and disastrous strain among others its proteome consists of total 11 proteins as shown in table 153 the results of sequence similarity to reveal orthologs using blastp are shown in table 154 the sequences with greater than 30 identity score are considered as homologs the phylogenetic tree is depicted in fig 151 and the mers-cov taken as seed genome found clustered with different bat coronaviruses




 the results of analysis of secondary structure of the proteome using expasy tools are shown in the table 155 from the analysis of charge on the residues and ph values it is concluded that six of the proteins are basic and positively charged unlike allergens which are acidic in nature however five proteins are acidic and show negative charge the negative gravy score of five proteins justify them to be of hydrophilic nature with majority of the residues positioned towards the surface for the rest of six proteins the gravy score is positive it means that these are hydrophobic proteins the proteins with less than 40 value of instability index are quite stable than those with higher values all the proteins are having the molecular weight less than 110 kda except 3 yp0090472021 yp0090472031 and yp0090472041 this exhibits the effectiveness of lightweight proteins as targets as they can be easily purified because of their low molecular weights the protein yp0090472041 is reported as a spike glycoprotein it is acidic with prominent negative charge with negative gravy score which suggests its hydrophilicity and presence on surface however the envelope protein yp0090472091 and membrane protein yp0090472101 are basic and hydrophobic
 figure 152 depicts the subcellular localization of proteins of the seed genome ie mers-cov only one protein was predicted to be localized in host cytoplasm four in host membrane two in both host cell membrane and endoplasmic reticulum er while two in only er and two are left unrecognized the known spike protein is predicted to be localized in host er from these results we decided to pick the proteins which are located in host membrane or were predicted to be localized in both host membrane and er the two are known envelop protein and membrane protein from bibliographic studies and along with that the known spike protein was also included in the filtered results out of the filtered proteins only two yp0090472101 and yp0090472081 contain more than two transmembrane helices therefore filtered out the results of transmembrane helices prediction are tabulated in table 156 figure 153 depicts the subcellular localization of proteins of all the four selected genomes using virus-mploc prediction tool


 the proteins that are predicted to possess the signal peptides by signal-blast web server are yp0090472041 and yp0090472051 the results of signal-blast web server are tabulated in the table 157
 this step takes into account the concept of adhesion-based virulence adhesions cause pathogen recognition and initiation of inflammatory responses by the host spaan predicted 2 yp0090472041 and yp0090472051 out of 11 proteins of mers strain as adhesive table 158
 only one protein yp0090472041 was predicted to contain betawrap motifs within it table 158 hence it is considered virulent and might be responsible for initializing the infection in the host a total of 9 out of 11 proteins of mers strain were predicted antigenic prediction values greater than 04 the protein with accession number yp0090472061 and yp0090472081 were among the filtered proteins however not predicted antigenic therefore filtered out as a result only four proteins yp0090472041 yp0090472051 yp0090472071 and yp0090472091 were kept for further analyses none of the 11 proteins of mers-cov possessed any clue of allergenicity as per prediction results from algpred and allertop tools it means that no vigorous immune responses will be mounted if the epitopes from these proteins will be adopted as vaccine candidates none of the protein of mers strain shows similarity with the proteins of host that demonstrates that the epitopes from these proteins can safely elicit the required immune response without the hazard of autoimmunity in total 12 different 9-mer epitopes with potential to bind to receptors of both b-cell and t-cell were predicted the list of the predicted epitopes can be found in the table 159 and are specific for mers-cov strain all these epitopes displayed no conservancy with proteins of other human and non-human pathogenic strains

 the most chief restriction for developing a safe and sound vaccine against any of the virus is to identify the protective antigens the present study is an effort of application of reverse vaccinology approach to investigate a choice of coronavirus proteomes to identify possible vaccine targets this technique has demonstrated to be a competent way to forecast 12 different epitopes from the selected seed genome these epitopes are from spike glycoprotein ns3 protein ns4b protein and envelope protein unfortunately none of the epitope is found conserved in other strains and all are specific to mers-cov the docking analysis studies revealed perfect binding between hla-a0201 receptor and epitopes the conserved residues of the receptor site are also involved in h-bonding with epitope residues further the selected antigenic epitopes must be validated using in vitro and in vivo studies to confirm their potential as vaccine candidates  a double-inactivated whole virus candidate sars coronavirus vaccine stimulates neutralising and protective antibody responses martin spruth otfried kistner helga savidis-dacho elisabeth hitter brian crowe marijan gerencer peter brhl leopold grillberger manfred reiter christa tauer wolfgang mundt p barrett noel   severe acute respiratory syndrome is a new disease which emerged in china in late 2002 and spread rapidly around the world this epidemic which resulted in over 8000 infections and almost 800 deaths raised considerable concerns that this emerging agent constituted a serious threat for global public health the identification of a novel coronavirus sars-cov associated with this syndrome 1 2 3 raised the possibility of development of a vaccine to prevent infection although there have no reports of community-acquired human sars infections since january 2004 a re-emergence of the disease is still a possibility the virus remains in animal reservoirs and there is a potential for further spread to humans 4 thus despite the disappearance of the disease in humans there is still an urgent need for rapid development of a safe and effective vaccine it is generally considered that live attenuated viruses are the most effective viral vaccines because of their ability to induce strong cellular and humoral immune responses 5 however the need for extensive safety testing of such vaccines can delay entry of such candidate vaccines into clinical trials multiple studies have reported that antibodies directed against the spike s glycoprotein can neutralise sars-cov infectivity 6 7 8 9 the s protein is reported to bind to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 hace-2 protein to mediate viral entry to the cell 10 human monoclonal antibodies directed against the s protein have been reported to reduce replication of the virus in the lung of infected ferrets and to completely prevent the development of sars co-v induced lung pathology 11 in addition a number of candidate vaccines induced protection against challenge with live virus in animal models and this protection was associated with high levels of neutralising antibody 12 13 14 thus it is likely that an inactivated or recombinant candidate vaccine containing the s protein will be able to induce protective immunity based primarily on stimulation of a humoral immune response we have favoured the development of an inactivated candidate whole virus vaccine as we have a well-established technology for rapid development of such vaccines we have previously reported on the use of large scale vero cell fermenter cultures for the development of an inactivated whole virus influenza vaccine 15 this technology has been adapted for the development of a double inactivated whole virus sars co-v candidate vaccine we report here on the characterisation of this candidate vaccine with respect to safety and immunogenicity sars-cov cdc200301157 also referred to as strain utah genbank accession number ay714217 was obtained from the

33-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and h2o2 female cd1 mice 68 weeks old were obtained from the charles river laboratories subsidiary in sulzfeld germany after sampling of pre-immune sera mice were immunised with six different doses of the candidate vaccine ranging from 1 g to 03 ng total protein method according to bradford 16 to evaluate the effect of adjuvantation on the immunogenicity of the vaccine a non-adjuvanted preparation and material adjuvanted with 005 and 02 aluminium hydroxide alum was tested at each antigen concentration groups of 10 mice were inoculated subcutaneously sc with 05 ml of each vaccine preparation control groups received the same volume of buffer tris-buffered saline with or without 02 aluminium hydroxide fourteen days post-immunisation sera were drawn from each animal and a booster immunisation was carried out with the same formulation and dosage as inoculated during primary immunisation sera were then drawn from each animal 4 weeks after primary immunisation animals treated with the 02 aluminium hydroxide containing vaccine were also bled 12 weeks after primary immunisation balbc mice 67 weeks old were also obtained from the charles river laboratories subsidiary for cytokine studies groups of 15 mice balbc mice were immunised sc with 1 g of vaccine adjuvanted with 02 alum booster injections with the same formulation were given 14 and 28 days post primary immunisation mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 21 and 35 days after the primary immunisation five mice per group a single cell suspension was prepared from the pooled spleens of five animals by forcing minced tissue through 200 mesh stainless steel sieves red blood cells were depleted by incubation for 5 min at room temperature with lysis buffer containing 015 m nh4cl 10 mm khco3 and 01 m na2-edta ph 74 and the leukocytes were suspended in complete cell culture medium a subset of the immunised cd1 mice ie four mice each of the groups that received vaccine doses of 02 g03 ng and the control groups see section 231 were challenged 5 weeks groups that received the non-adjuvanted or the 005 aluminium hydroxide containing preparation or 13 weeks 02 aluminium hydroxide after primary immunisation prior to challenge a blood sample was drawn for determination of neutralising antibody titres for challenge mice were anaesthetised with isofluran and inoculated intranasally with a dose of 105 tcid50 sars-cov contained in a volume of 20 l 10 l per nostril non-cloned sars-cov cdc200301157 that has been propagated five times on serum protein free vero sf cells was used for homologous challenge on day 3 post inoculation pi mice were euthanised with isofluran followed by barbiturate before lung and trachea were removed and frozen at 60 c prior to titration in the tcid50 assay tissue samples were thawed and homogenised in 1 ml of vero cell culture medium supplemented with antibiotics the igg titre against the s protein of sars-cov was determined by an indirect elisa briefly 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 28 c with 100 ng of baculovirus bv-expressed full-length his-tagged s protein protein sciences meriden ct usa in 50 mm carbonate buffer ph 96 per well or left uncoated respectively subsequent to washing and blocking for 1 h with 3 non-fat dry milk serial fourfold dilutions of sera starting with a 1100 dilution were

chemical westbury ny usa working dilution of 15000 followed by washes and development using opdh2o2 finally colour development was stopped by the addition of 5 m h2so4 and the plates were read at 490620 nm by elisa plate reader bio-tek winooski vt usa to determine the endpoint antibody titre all absorbance readings equal or greater than the cut-off value four times the mean absorbance value of a 1100 dilution of a negative control serum were considered positive serum samples were serially diluted with cell culture medium in twofold steps usually beginning at a dilution of 120 or 140 the serum dilutions were mixed at a ratio of 11 with a virus stock suspension adjusted to 1035
 tcid50ml incubated for 1 h at room temperature and transferred eight replicates per dilution to a 96-well tissue culture plate seeded with a vero cells the plates were incubated for 5 days at 37 c in a co2-incubator before the cultures were inspected under a light microscope for the presence of a cytopathic effect cpe caused by sars-cov ie cell rounding and detachment the neutralising titre was calculated by the number of virus negative wells and the serum dilution according to the method of spearman 17 the frequency of interferon- ifn- or interleukin-4 il-4 secreting cells was analysed using mouse ifn- and il-4 elispot kits mabtech ab nacka sweden following the instructions of the manufacturer serial dilutions of freshly isolated spleen cells of balbc mice were added to the wells ranging from 5  104 to 2  105 cells per well of antibody-coated 96-well plates for stimulation sars candidate vaccine and recombinant bv-expressed s protein were added at a concentration of 011 gml wells containing no antigen or 1 gml of pokeweed mitogen sigma st louis usa were used as negative and positive control respectively the plates were then incubated overnight at 37 c and 5 co2 before the cells were discarded and the plates were washed with pbs interferon- or il-4 respectively was detected by a biotinylated interferon- or il-4 specific antibody followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and development with bcipnbt substrate solution the number of spots was counted using an automated elispot reader aid strassberg germany the number of spots observed in wells containing no antigen was subtracted from the number of spots observed in wells containing specific antigen and the results were expressed as spot forming cells sfc per 106 spleen cells the infectious virus titre of sars-cov-containing samples was determined by a tcid50 assay in brief serial 10-fold dilutions of virus containing samples were inoculated onto 96-well microtiter plates seeded with vero cells after incubation for 57 days at 37 c in a co2-incubator the plates were screened under a light microscope for the presence of a cpe from the number of virus positive wells per dilution the tcid50 was calculated according to the poisson formula by means of an in-house calculation software program this program provides estimation of tcid50 of titres and its 95 confidence limits based on the one-hit model 18 we have previously reported on the development of a formalin inactivated whole virus influenza vaccine which was produced using large-scale serum protein free vero cell fermenter cultures 15 this development of a candidate sars-cov vaccine was based on adaption of this well established technology to establish optimal conditions for growth inactivation and purification of the inactivated virus the sars-cov had been reported to grow well on vero cells 2 3 so it was considered that this was probably the optimal cell matrix for rapid vaccine development a primary virus seed was generated from a human isolate by five sequential plaque clonings this primary seed was further amplified to generate a seed virus bank a working virus bank and a production virus bank the production virus was then used to infect serum protein free cultures using a fermenter volume of 100 l following an incubation period of 23 days the virus containing supernatant was then harvested and inactivated by 005 formalin treatment for 48 h followed by uv inactivation with an uv dose of 20 mjcm2 virus infection at a multiplicity of infection moi of 0001 resulted in generation of high viral titres 108
 tcid50ml in the supernatant and both the formalin and uv inactivation steps were independently capable of inactivating this titre with a large margin of safety manuscript in preparation following inactivation the virus was then subjected to a two-step purification involving continuous flow zonal centrifugation over a 050 sucrose gradient followed by an ultradiafiltration process the results of this two-step purification procedure are demonstrated in fig 1
 two lots of purified vaccine were subjected to western blot analysis and stained with both a specific anti-s glycoprotein fig 1a and anti-n antibodies fig 1b in addition the protein composition was analysed by staining with colloidal gold fig 1c these figures demonstrate that the final purified bulk vaccine is very pure and contains s protein and n protein bands at the equivalent molecular weights to the infectious virus particle prior to inactivation and purification some cross-linking of these proteins was also seen in inactivated preparations an electron micrograph of the purified inactivated preparation confirmed this data fig 2
 with virus particles being demonstrated to present well defined spikes on the virus membrane the immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine was initially investigated in dose-finding and adjuvant studies performed in cd1 mice for this purpose groups of 10 mice were immunised twice with decreasing doses of the purified non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted vaccine at doses ranging from 1 g to 03 ng to evaluate the effect of adjuvantation on the immunogenicity of the vaccine a non-adjuvanted preparation and material adjuvanted with 005 and 02 aluminium hydroxide was tested at each antigen concentration the s specific antibody titre and neutralising antibody titre for each individual serum was then determined as described in sections 25 26 the geometric mean titre gmt determined for each group of animals is presented in fig 3
 these data demonstrate that the candidate vaccine is highly immunogenic in cd1 mice following a single immunisation with 1 or 02 g s specific antibody titres with gmt up to approximately 15000 for the adjuvanted formulations and 11000 for the non-adjuvanted formulation were measured 2 weeks after the primary immunisation data not shown neutralising antibody titres were not measured at this time point following the booster immunisation elisa titres were substantially increased and gmts of up to 1400000 could be obtained with the 1 g dosage adjuvanted with 02 aluminium hydroxide reduction of the dosage to as little as 03 ng in an adjuvanted formulation still resulted in the development of a low titre antibody response fig 3a high titre neutralising antibodies approximately 11000 were also measured for the 02 g adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations 3 weeks after the booster immunisation fig 3b groups of mice immunised with the 02 aluminium hydroxide formulations were bled 10 and 11 weeks after booster immunisation and it was demonstrated that high titre s specific and neutralising antibodies were still detected at this stage fig 3c and d the influence of adjuvant on s specific antibody responses was also determined by calculating the effective dose 50 ed50 ie the minimum amount of antigen required for seroconversion in 50 of mice after two immunisations the data in table 1a
demonstrates that following a booster immunisation the non-adjuvanted and the vaccine containing 02 alum induced a very similar antibody response ed50 values of 11 and 08 ng respectively were obtained for non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted 02 alum vaccines the vaccine adjuvanted with 005 alum was somewhat more immunogenic seventy percent of the mice developed specific antibodies against the s protein even at the lowest dose applied ie 03 ng due to the high proportion of seroconverters the ed50 could not be exactly calculated but it was 01 ng the proportion of animals which demonstrated a neutralising antibody titre was also analysed in a subset of immunised mice n
  4 and the ed50 based on neutralising antibody response was also calculated table 1b
 this data was similar to that obtained for elisa igg determinations but differed somewhat in that the highest proportion of animals with neutralising antibodies were seen in the adjuvanted formulation with the highest concentration of alum 02 further characterisation of the immune responses in mice was carried out by investigating specific cytokine responses to vaccination the type of immune response was determined by measurement of interferon- a marker for th-1 responses and interleukin-4 which is a marker for a th-2 response for cytokine studies balbc mice were immunised sc with 1 g of antigen adjuvanted with 02 alum booster injections with the same formulation were given 14 and 28 days post primary immunisation mice were sacrificed 21 and 35 days after the primary immunisation spleen cells were isolated from balbc mice and stimulated with a purified recombinant s protein or candidate vaccine see sections 232 27 the data presented in fig 4
shows that substantial ifn- and il-4 responses were obtained after two immunisations with whole virus vaccine however the responses to the whole virus vaccine were substantially higher than those obtained following stimulation with recombinant s protein after two immunisations following a third immunisation the il-4 response to recombinant s protein was increased to the level obtained for whole virus antigen whereas no significant ifn- response could still be detected upon stimulation with recombinant s protein in addition it could be demonstrated that as little as 01 gml of whole virus antigen was sufficient to stimulate substantial th-1 ifn- and th-2 il-4 responses following the demonstration that the candidate vaccine was highly immunogenic the protective efficacy of the vaccine was investigated in cd1 mice a subset ie four mice per group of cd1 mice immunised during dose-finding and adjuvant studies see above were challenged 5 or 13 weeks post primary immunisation by intranasal delivery of 105 tcid50 of homologous virus strain virus replication in the respiratory tract was monitored as described in section 24 the data presented in table 2
demonstrates again that the non-adjuvanted vaccine and vaccine preparations adjuvanted with 005 aluminium hydroxide were highly effective in inducing specific anti-s antibodies and neutralising antibodies an antigen dose as low 8 ng with or without adjuvant was effective in inducing neutralising antibodies in 3 of 4 or 4 of 4 immunised animals respectively challenge with 105 tcid50 of live virus resulted in virus replication in the lung of 100 of mock immunised mice however immunisation with candidate vaccine antigen doses as low as 8 ng resulted in a high degree of protection of vaccinated mice 3 of 4 and 4 of 4 animals protected reduced doses of antigen still resulted in partial protection with 50 of immunised mice being protected following immunisation with 16 ng of vaccine antigen similar data were obtained for vaccine preparations adjuvanted with 02 aluminium hydroxide data not shown the 50 protective dose pd50 was calculated for all three vaccine formulations and were shown to be approximately equal with pd50s of 14 07 and 10 ng being calculated for formulations without adjuvant with 005 alum and 02 alum respectively table 3
 the data presented in table 2 indicated that there was a clear correlation between specific igg titre against s protein neutralising antibody titre and protection against intra-nasal challenge with live virus this data was confirmed by summarising all protection data obtained in the mouse model table 4
summarises the data obtained for a total of 168 mice used in various immunisation studies during the course of this development the data in table 4a demonstrates that a specific anti-s igg titre of 25600 resulted in 100 protection of mice challenged with 105 tcid50 of live virus it was also demonstrated that a specific neutralising titre 114 resulted in 100 protection against challenge table 4b no virus replication was seen in mice with antibody titres above these levels in contrast 89 of the control animals were infected by intranasal challenge with 105 tcid50 of live virus this report describes the extensive immunological characterisation of a candidate sars coronavirus vaccine a number of different strategies have previously been reported for the development of experimental and candidate human sars vaccines these include inactivated whole virus vaccines 19 20 21 attenuated viral vectors expressing sars-cov proteins 7 8 12 13 and dna vaccines 14 22 we have favoured the strategy of a whole virus vaccine development for a number of reasons including speed of development the virus grows to very high titres in vero cells a cell line accepted by most regulatory authorities a similar technology used for this development has been utilised for development and industrial scale production of an influenza virus vaccine 15 manufacturing facilities are also in place at the appropriate biosafety level to utilise this technology for rapid large scale vaccine production however in addition to these technology and logistical reasons it is also likely that an inactivated whole virus vaccine would be most efficient in inducing neutralising antibodies which are possibly critical in preventing sars-cov infection most processes for inactivated whole virus vaccines have utilised either formaldehyde or -propiolactone as an inactivating agent there have been reports of inactivation failures associated with both of these methodologies even in the recent past 23 we have therefore developed a strategy involving a double inactivation process utilising formaldehyde and uv inactivations although formaldehyde is reported to react with protein and nucleic acid the reactions with nucleic acid particularly when the nucleic acid is a component of a virus particle are less well established therefore we have decided to introduce a second inactivation step in addition to formaldehyde ie uv inactivation directed primarily against nucleic acid both of these processes were independently demonstrated to be capable of inactivating 108
 tcid50ml with a large margin of safety manuscript in preparation however it was also essential to demonstrate that this combination of inactivation steps did not destroy the viral antigenic structure and immunogenicity the data presented in fig 1 demonstrates that the major virus antigens ie the s glycoprotein and n protein were not negatively effected no additional breakdown products could be detected compared to the non-inactivated preparation in addition transmission electron microscopy analysis of uranyl acetate stained samples demonstrated that the inactivated virion presented well-defined spike structures on the virus particle with no apparent structural alterations resulting from the inactivation procedures these antigenic and structural analyses were then followed up with an extensive immunological characterisation of the candidate vaccine dose finding and adjuvant studies were carried out in mice with measurement of antibody responses by s specific elisa and infectivity neutralising titres the data presented in fig 3 demonstrated that the double inactivated preparation was highly immunogenic with s specific elisa titres of up to 1400000 being obtained following two immunisations with 1 g antigen adjuvanted with 02 aluminum hydroxide high neutralising titres were also obtained following an immunisation and booster with 02 g antigen with titres of approximately 11000 being obtained this immunogenicity appears to be higher than that reported for other whole virus vaccines subjected to a single inactivation step although differences in methodologies make direct comparisons difficult 20 21 the double inactivated vaccine was also able to induce very high antibody responses even in the absence of adjuvant this is similar to data reported for an uv inactivated vaccine 21 and for a -propiolactone inactivated vaccine 20 where little difference in the level of neutralising antibodies in mice was reported the minimal influence of adjuvantation on vaccine immunogenicity was also confirmed in these studies by calculation of the ed50 there was little difference in ed50 of the non-adjuvanted and 02 alum adjuvanted material although the 005 alum adjuvanted material appeared to be more immunogenic table 1a however this was not confirmed when the ed50 was calculated on the basis of neutralising antibody responses with the non-adjuvanted material being more immunogenic than the preparation with 005 alum table 1b in addition to characterisation of humoral responses by antibody measurement the th-1 and th-2 responses to immunisation were analysed by cytokine production the data presented in fig 4 demonstrated that the double inactivated candidate vaccine was capable of inducing cytokine markers for both th-1 and th-2 responses however the responses to stimulation with recombinant s protein indicated that t cell responses to the s protein were predominantly th-2 responses which would be expected for an alum adjuvanted whole virus vaccine 24 this is in agreement with data reported for immunisation with uv-inactivated sars-cov which demonstrated substantial il-4 and ifn- responses to immunisation 21 following demonstration of the immunogenicity of the vaccine investigations were then initiated to demonstrate the efficacy of the candidate vaccine in preventing infection in a small animal model balbc mice have been established as a good rodent model for the replications of sars co-v 25 we have demonstrated that the virus replicated very well in the respiratory tract of cd1 mice and this model was used to investigate the protective efficacy of the vaccine the data in table 2 demonstrates that both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine preparations at an antigen concentration of 02 g protected 100 of immunised mice from challenge with high titre 105 tcid50 virus by the intra-nasal route the vaccine appeared to be effective at very low doses of antigen calculation of the pd50 table 3 for non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted vaccines confirmed that very low antigen concentrations approximately 1 ng were sufficient to provide protection of 50 of immunised mice this figure is even lower than that calculated for highly effective well-established flavivirus vaccines such as tick-borne encephalitis which has a calculated pd50 of 32 ng in a similar model 26 unpublished data these protection studies were also used to establish a serological correlate of protection the data in table 4 demonstrate that induction of neutralising antibody titres 114 and a s specific elisa titre of 25600 resulted in 100 protection against intra-nasal challenge with 105 tcid50 of infectious virus these data clearly indicate that a double inactivated whole virus vaccine is a promising candidate for an effective human vaccine the use of two inactivation steps based on different mechanisms of infection will ensure safety with respect to residual infectious virus however it has been reported that vaccination with a feline coronavirus vaccine resulted in antibody induced enhancement of infection 27 28 no suggestion of such a phenomenon could be induced from the challenge studies reported here or in other studies where protection was achieved by induction of neutralising antibodies with mva 13 or parainfluenza 8 vectored spike protein live viral vaccines however vaccine induced enhancement of coronavirus infection will require further study as there have been reports that vaccination of ferrets with rmva expressing sars-cov s protein was associated with enhanced hepatitis 29

chiranjib chakraborty   the epidemic of coronavirus infection covid-19 was first reported in the wuhan city of china and later it has spread rapidly throughout china along with other countries following a pandemic on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared a public health emergency of international concern considering the quick outbreak of the disease 1 to date a total of 10719946 confirmed cases and 517337 deaths have been reported by who infected patients develop symptoms like fever cough fatigue myalgia dyspnea decreased leukocyte counts etc 2 3 4 the established mode of transmission for this disease is through physical contact by any of the following means cough sneezes and respiratory droplets 5 6 7 the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 earlier known as novel coronavirus 2019-ncov is the pathogenic identity for covid-19 8 9 10 it is an enveloped virus consisting of positive-strand rna as the genomic component 11 the virus has a characteristic of crown-like appearance due to the spike glycoprotein on the viral envelope 12 spike glycoprotein could be the most suitable target for drug designing vaccine development and immunotherapy because of its outer surface localization all the selected epitopes were either predicted or validated in the human immunological framework model such an approach could provide a practical method for designing and developing vaccine candidates against the sars-cov-2 initially the selection of the desired antigens or considering specific proteins as immunogens is a challenging job therefore the epitope-based vaccine design in silico cloning and validation can allow the evaluation of a particular vaccine for its novelty and effectiveness in a given time frame recently we have proposed an epitope-based in silico peptide vaccine against the sars-cov-2 13 herein we have tried to perform in silico characterizations and validations of these identified epitopes an understanding of the allergenic nature is a must for the safety and effectiveness of any vaccine thus we analyzed the allergenicity of the constructed vaccine candidate and verified whether these epitopes are feasible for developing a robust vaccine against sars-cov-2 moreover molecular docking was performed in a web-based docking server and molecular dynamic simulation was executed to compare and validate the interactions between receptor-ligand complex additionally codon adaptation and in-silico cloning were designed for future amplification of targeted vaccine into the expression vector as per requirement collectively this in silico validation has tried to prove the effectiveness of the developed vaccine candidate with identified epitopes to control the sars-cov-2 infection the multi-epitopes of the sars-cov-2 spike protein were selected and retrieved from our previously published work 13 these epitopes were used to construct a vaccine and a similar methodology has been employed here for analyzing the effectiveness of the proposed vaccine candidate the novel vaccine should be non-allergenic for its compelling performance here two servers allertop and allergenfp were used for allergenicity assessment of our vaccine candidate 1415 both the servers rely on the principle of auto cross-covariance acc and allergenic evaluation methods these two methods utilize the physicochemical properties of amino acid residues molecular docking analysis was performed to study the stable protein-protein interaction and related sub-cellular functions for molecular docking the cluspro 20 protein-protein docking server was used 16 in the cluspro server the rigid body docking phase uses the piper docking program which relies on the fast fourier transform fft correlation

 both allertop and allergenfp servers confirmed the non-allergenic nature of the proposed vaccine component therefore the vaccine might not show any harmful allergic reaction after administration the outputs of molecular docking in cluspro 20 showed high negative energy 13623 kcalmol for the docking between tlr45 proteins and the vaccine component the cysteine 646 of tlr4tlr5 formed a non-covalent bond 35  with tyrosine 189 of the vaccine construct whereas threonine 647 of tlr4tlr5 formed two non-covalent bonds 29  and 23  with phenylalanine 186 fig 1
 the probable immune cascade mechanism of the vaccine candidate in the tirap receptor protein has been depicted in fig 2
24 the molecular dynamic simulation of tlr45 proteins and the vaccine candidate was performed by the visual molecular dynamics vmd 183 program and it produced 700 frames 100 frame  5000 ts  10 ps and rmsd plot fig 3
a and b rmsf was calculated for c- atoms and in rmsd total protein was selected against the backbone of c- the plot displayed that the protein complex was in a steady-state as per the normal mode analysis mobility upon binding the vaccine component and the receptor proteins tlr4tlr5 were significantly directed to each other fig 4
a 25 the deformability plot showed a little bit of fluctuation fig 4c whereas the normal mode analysis b-factor was highly minimized from its pdb b-factor fig 4b the eigenvalue showed an inverse relationship with the variance of the protein-protein docking complex and the estimated eigenvalue was 1129951e07 fig 4d in the present work the covariance matrix is illustrated through the graphical representation via white red and blue colors color variation indicates the correlated uncorrelated and anti-correlated pairs of amino acid residues respectively fig 4e springs of atomic contact are plotted as grey dots in the elastic network model where the stiffness of interaction was proportional to the gradient of the grey color fig 4f 
in silico cloning is a rapid method to assess the possibility of developing a potent multi-epitopic vaccine in a given time frame here the jcat server calculated the codon adaptation index cai and gc content of the optimized nucleotides sequence of constructed sars-cov-2 peptide-based vaccine the value was noted as 10 and 4661654 respectively these are exceptional values for possible efficient expression of the construct vaccine into the host finally the webdsv tool was applied for inserting the adapted codon sequences of the peptide-based vaccine candidate within the pet28a vector for expression fig 5
 the physiochemical properties and details of solubility of the peptide-based-epitope vaccine candidate are listed in table 2
 our vaccine candidate showed an instability index of 1664 40 stable and a solubility score of 0698 the estimated half-life was determined as 1 h mammalian reticulocytes in vitro and 10 h escherichia coli in vivo the sars-cov-2 has become a global concern and is rapidly emerging as a threat to human civilization covid-19 as a pandemic has already caused many deaths around the globe and still is affecting the human population at a rapid rate hence the new therapeutic approach by targeting tlrs tlr4tlr5 modulation may serve as a better choice for vaccine or adjuvant development against the infection of sars-cov-2 26 kaur et al developed a multi-epitope peptide-based chimeric vaccine against the taeniasolium by in silico approaches 26 the structural vaccinological analysis and computational validation of the vaccine candidate were also performed against the mayaro virus 27 in considerate to the human pathogenic viruses west nile virus and ebola virus specific peptide-based vaccine has been developed by employing immuno-pharmacoinformatic techniques 2829 the principal focus of our current study was the in silico evaluation of potent vaccine candidates from identified common epitopes primarily we have chosen 16 common b-cell and t-cell epitopes from our previous published work 13 afterward an analysis of the allergenic property was carried out on the designed vaccine candidate safe efficacy is a prerequisite for a vaccine for successful human administration 30 from the analysis in the allertop and allergenfp servers it was found that the constructed vaccine candidate is non-allergenic and safe for future in vivo and in vitro work further molecular docking of vaccine candidates with tlr proteins was performed in the cluspro 20 server to compare and validate the accuracy stable protein-protein binding and molecular interactions 3132 it was observed that the molecular docking was significant with a high negative energy value lowest energy value 13623 kcalmol of the top ordered protein-protein docking complex 3334 the molecular dynamics simulation based refinement of the tlr4tlr5 and vaccine candidate protein complex established the fact that the conformational model was in a steady state the residues in the protein complex accelerated conformation transitions among the local energy state in 700 frames 5000 ts  10 ps time against distance trajectory the mobility of the protein complex formed by molecular docking was justified through the normal mode analysis mobility study 35 outputs of the normal mode analysis study using imods revealed that both tlr4tlr5 and vaccine candidates have stable interaction movement towards each other upon molecular binding additionally the complex was not easily deformable as there were significantly lower peaks in the deformability plot furthermore codon adaptation within the prokaryotic system was analyzed to obtain a better adaptation and high expression profile in a eukaryotic expression system when the construct vaccine candidate was cloned into the pet28  expression vector with the help of webdsvver 20 higher expression of the cloned codons was projected the pi value predicted in the protparam tool indicates the essential cation rich character of the vaccine candidate the prediction also helps to compute the stability of the vaccine into the host body an aliphatic index of 6103 predicted that the vaccine is thermostable while the instability index lower than 40 1660 indicated higher stability of the vaccine structure after expression our in silico work reveals that the proposed vaccine candidate is non-allergenic and has efficient as well as stable molecular interaction with the tlr proteins of humans results also indicate a high potential and effectiveness of the selected epitopes against sars-cov-2 the codon adaptation and in silico cloning established the impending amplification ability of the vaccine construct within the expression vector as per the conditional requirement furthermore our in silico analysis might be encouraging to the researchers who are trying to develop efficient therapy against covid-19 however constructed vaccine candidates

covid-19 vaccines paul-henri lambert donna ambrosino m svein andersen r ralph baric s steven black b robert chen t cornelia dekker l arnaud didierlaurent m barney graham s samantha martin d deborah molrine c stanley perlman philip picard-fraser a andrew pollard j chuan qin kanta subbarao jakob cramer p   since the identification of a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 as the cause of pneumonia in patients from wuhan china a pandemic has erupted resulting in enormous health care social and economic disruption to our global society 1 as of may 17 2020 there have been 4708415 cases and 314950 deaths worldwide 2 in rapid response to the pandemic academic and industry scientists from around the world have initiated efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics for disease prevention and patient management the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi a global partnership between public private philanthropic and civil organizations is funding work to develop sars-cov-2 vaccines using a variety of technology platforms several vaccine candidates are already in phase 1 studies with others likely to enter the clinic in the next few months 3 one of the challenges facing rapid vaccine development for sars-cov-2 is the need to adequately assure the safety of these vaccines one such safety concern is disease enhancement syndrome that occurred in the 1960s with inactivated rsv and measles vaccines vaccine-mediated disease enhancement is characterized by a vaccine that results in increased disease severity if the subject is later infected by the natural virus during early trials with inactivated rsv vaccine the vaccine did not prevent infection 80 of those infected required hospitalization and two children died 4 lung pathology in patients showed an unexpected inflammatory response with both neutrophils and eosinophils evidence of immune complex formation and complement activation in small airways 5 scientists later learned that the vaccine caused a similar disease enhancement in animals characterized by immunopathology and a t helper cell type 2 th2 biased response and antibody responses with poor neutralizing activity 6 7 8 since that time the animal models have been relied upon to predict safety for new rsv vaccines that are developed of note the pathogenesis of rsv disease enhancement is distinct from antibody disease enhancement ade which occurs for macrophage tropic viruses demonstrated most notably for dengue in humans and the coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus in cats and is directly caused by non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies leading to more efficient viral uptake via fc receptor binding 9 since pathology consistent with the rsv vaccine enhanced disease and perhaps ade has been demonstrated for some sars-cov-1 vaccine candidates in animal models there is also a concern that a similar syndrome could occur in humans immunized with sars-cov-2 candidate vaccines therefore cepi and the brighton collaboration safety platform for emergency vaccines speac convened a scientific working meeting httpsbrightoncollaborationusbrighton-collaboration-cepi-covid-19-web-conference on march 12 and 13 2020 of experts in the field of vaccine immunology and coronaviruses to discuss current knowledge that could form the basis for the assessment of the risk of enhanced disease during sars-cov-2 vaccine development this consensus report presents considerations for vaccine developers and can serve as a guide for the development and testing of vaccine candidates to avoid these safety concerns ultimately the door to clinical trials is controlled by regulators in the context of the riskbenefit for the entire dataset provided by developers and within the local trial context dr kanta subbarao director of the who collaborating centre for reference and research on influenza and professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at the university of melbourne and dr stanley perlman professor in the departments of microbiology and immunology and pediatrics at the university of iowa both reviewed their work and that of others in animal models developed for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov the lessons from these models can inform the development priorities for useful sars-cov-2 animal models to address both efficacy and safety in inbred mouse strains sars-cov-1 replicates efficiently in the respiratory tract and can cause pneumonitis but clinical signs and pneumonia were only observed in old balbc mice 10 subsequent passage of sars-cov-1 through mouse lungs resulted in the isolation of virus that caused severe disease in both young and old mice 11 12 this virus was used in many subsequent studies ferret models of sars-cov-1 also demonstrate virus replication in respiratory tracts with induction of a neutralizing antibody response but also demonstrated little evidence of clinical disease 13 hamsters in contrast to mice and ferrets demonstrate high levels of viral replication develop pneumonitis and can be shown to have clinical signs of disease 14 following the identification of human ace2 as the receptor for sars-cov-1 transgenic murine models expressing human ace2 receptor hace2 were developed and shown to develop mild pulmonary disease of note these mice also developed lethal viral encephalitis attributed to viral spread through the olfactory nerve despite the relative scarcity of hace2 expression in the brain which may have relevance to sars-cov-2 disease 15 efficacy of several sars-cov-1 vaccines was evaluated in these models with spike s protein based vaccines demonstrating neutralizing antibody and protection against pulmonary replication of the challenge virus in mice and hamsters 16 for dna vaccine studies it was shown that candidate vaccines encoding the s protein conferred antibody mediated protection from challenge in mice and that vaccines encoding the n protein induced humoral and cellular immunity 17 18 for vectored vaccines expressing sars-cov-1 proteins it was shown that viral proteins were expressed in mice ferrets and hamsters in these studies neutralizing antibodies were elicited by bhpiv3 vsv rabies mva and adeno viruses expressing s protein that protected against sars-cov-1 replication in lungs of challenged animals however one mva vaccine expressing the s-protein did not protect against infection 16 in contrast to sars-cov-1 inbred mice were found to be resistant to mers-cov thus infection was studied by creating models that expressed the mers receptor human dpp4 hdpp4 ad5-hdpp4 transduced mice could be infected with mers virus but infection was associated with minimal clinical disease except in immunocompromised mice that developed weight loss after infection of note hdpp4-transgenic mice developed lethal viral encephalitis with concurrent inflammatory changes on histopathological examination of the lung similar to hace2-tg mice with sars-cov-1 subsequently investigators developed mice knocked-in for expression of hdpp4 and after virus passage in these mice identified mouse-adapted mers strains that caused more severe disease and increased histopathology with more pulmonary edema than those infected with the original mers strain 19 importantly mice without functional t cells such as rag1-- and tcr alpha-- had delayed viral clearance whereas mice that could not produce antibodies mumt mice did not show delay in clearance similar models were developed by crisprcas9 mutagenesis of two residues in the mouse ace2 molecule followed by mouse adaptation with serial passage leading to an ards model of lethal infection 20 21 taken together this evidence supports the notion that t cells are important in viral clearance for mers 22 non-human primate nhp models have also been established for both sars-cov-1 and mers-cov there was evidence of upper respiratory and lower respiratory tract sars-cov-1 replication in african green monkeys to a greater extent than in cynomolgus macaques and least in rhesus macaques with little evidence of clinical disease in all three species 23 of note consistent with findings in older humans and mice increased pathology has been documented in aged cynomolgus macaques with sars-cov-1 wild type infection 24 there is some controversy on the disease severity in the mers models with different groups seeing different levels of pathology this has not been resolved 25 26 both vaccine efficacy and safety have been studied in animal models with many sars-cov-1 candidate vaccines the group of experts discussed how the vaccine models were utilized to characterize the response of specific vaccines and to examine both disease enhancement and antibody dependent enhancement ade signals there is evidence for disease enhancement in vaccinated animals after challenge with live virus in multiple studies with sarscov-1 vaccine candidates as summarized in table 1
 we are limiting our comments in this report to data in animal models and not discussing in vitro data except to mention that there is some evidence of ade in human primary monocytes 27 28 different animal models exhibit different pulmonary pathology but generally characterized by cellular infiltrates including eosinophils in this summary we provide an overview of the consensus opinion on vaccine related outcomes in animal models that were of concern for risk of disease enhancement and could guide assessments of sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates in murine models evidence for vaccine related disease enhancement has been demonstrated for inactivated whole vaccine with and without alum vectored vaccine expressing n protein but not seen with vectored vaccine expressing s protein in same report a replicon particle platform expressing s protein and a vectored vaccine expressing s proteins in general the pathology described included pulmonary infiltrates often with eosinophils observed th2 dominant responses were documented in some reports by expression of th2 driven cytokines 29 30 31 32 33 in a ferret model hepatitis was demonstrated in animals vaccinated with a recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing s protein and then challenged with virus 34 although questions have been raised about this study 35 of note mouse models have also shown evidence of enhanced disease for inactivated and recombinant adenovirus 5-based mers-cov vaccine 36 37 non-human primate models have also produced evidence of enhanced disease after sars-cov-1 vaccine immunization chinese macaques immunized with a modified vaccinia virus expressing s protein then challenged with sars-cov-1 did not develop clinical disease but histopathology showed lung injury this injury was characterized by decreased wound healing and increased pro-inflammatory macrophages expressing il-6 il-8 and ccl2 38 this report also demonstrated that passively administered anti-s antibody was associated with lung pathology after challenge with the live virus although the mechanism may not be through fc receptor and thus not classic ade of note a second report similarly demonstrates the effect with certain anti-s antibody preparations and without fc involvement 39 40 the relevance of these reports remains unclear as there are multiple studies with administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to different models that did not induce disease enhancement other investigators have reported absence of disease enhancement in both hamsters and monkeys immunized with a whole inactivated vaccine although these models differed in a number of ways most notably by the use of bpl -propiolactone instead of formalin for inactivation of the virus 41 42 finally we note that there has not be an agreed upon positive control applied in these animal studies and thus interpretations are hamperedba animal models with sars-cov-2 are being rapidly developed by multiple research groups dr qin chuan professor and director of the institute of laboratory animal science comparative medicine center of the peking union medical college presented data on sars-cov-2 infection in both transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models human ace2 transgenic mice hace2 tg aged 4-6 weeks and 6-11 months of age were studied and hace2 expression was observed in lung heart kidney and intestinal tissues following intranasal inoculation with sars-cov-2 weight loss was observed and viral rna was detected in the lungs as well as in the intestine 43 gross pathology demonstrated swollen and enlarged lungs with moderate interstitial pneumonia histological studies documented an accumulation of inflammatory cells including monocytes and lymphocytes in alveolar interstitium with thickening of alveolar walls sars-cov-2 s protein was detected by ihc in alveolar macrophages and epithelia 43

 nhp were also infected with sars-cov-2 with 3 rhesus macaques aged 3-4 years inoculated intratracheally and although no fever was observed weight loss and asthenia were seen on multiple days viral rna was detected from nasal and throat swabs and to a lesser degree in anal specimens peaking on days 3 to 7 and lasting until day 11 post infection one animal was euthanized on day 7 for necropsy and viral rna was detected in multiple organs including cns skeletal muscle and heart for the two surviving rhesus macaques positive neutralization titers were documented by day 11 post infection there was radiographic evidence of multiple ground glass opacities in the lungs on days 3 5 and 7 post infection microscopically the lung lesions represented an acute interstitial pneumonia characterized by mild to moderate thickening of alveolar septum increased number of macrophages degeneration of pneumocytes and an inflammatory cell infiltration presence of viral antigen was confirmed predominately in alveolar monocytes and macrophages 44 analysis of blood samples showed a decline in counts of total white blood cells lymphocytes and monocytes with no observed changes in percentages a decrease in both cd3cd4 and cd3 cd8 t-cell counts was observed importantly these hematological findings are similar to those seen in sars-cov-2 infected patients this model could serve as a critical tool for detailed studies of pathogenesis and the evaluation of intervention strategies including vaccines of note following the meeting another group has confirmed sars-cov-2 infection in rhesus macaques with viral antigen detected in type i and type ii pneumocytes and diffuse pulmonary alveolar damage noted 45 experts agreed that these models and others under development should be utilized to evaluate vaccine candidates for any evidence of disease enhancement as specified in later sections design of safe and effective covid-19 vaccines can be informed by knowledge of previous coronavirus vaccine development activities and shared elements of viral pathogenesis for non-coronaviruses such as rsv specific epitope targets for potent neutralizing antibody platforms for inducing both neutralizing antibody and effective t cell responses and adjuvants for improving immunogenicity were presented at the conference we review first the structure and function of the major target of covid-19 vaccines spike s glycoprotein ralph baric phd professor in the department of epidemiology at the university of north carolina chapel hill school of medicine presented a review of the structure and function of coronavirus cov s glycoprotein highlighting priorities for the development of vaccine and immune therapeutics there is a long history of emerging covs with acceleration of cross-species movement and emergence of highly pathological strains in the last 16 years including sars-cov-1 mers-cov and sars-cov-2 and this trend is likely to increase in the future phylogenetic relationships within covs have been established and group 2b includes sars-cov-1 and sars-like covs including sars-cov-2 btcov wiv1 and btcov shc014 similarly group 2c are mers-like covs which are also poised for human emergence within group 2b known sars-like covs are divided into high or low pre-epidemic potential high risk features include use of ace2 for cell entry growth in primary human airway cells causing ards causing age-related disease severity and escape from existing immune therapeutics drivers of cov evolution include the high mutation rate of the rna-dependent rna polymerase paired with the regulated fidelity complex covs also demonstrate high rates of rna recombination as during mixed infection up to 25 of progeny are recombinant and modular evolution allows covs to swap whole genes or portions of key proteins between strains the s protein itself which regulates host range tissue tropism and transmissibility can tolerate a high mutation rate while retaining its function the organization of the sars-cov-2 genome has been elucidated and sars-cov-2 like sars-cov-1 has been shown to use hace2 for cell entry group 2b viruses have fourteen contact interfaces between their s protein and ace2 variation across the interface sites can facilitate orthologous species ace2 receptor usage since as few as seven interface sites are needed for entry the prefusion structure of the s glycoprotein has three major antigenic domains receptor binding domain rbd n terminal domain ntd and s2 epitopes on sars-cov-1 rbd have been identified as targets for neutralizing antibodies analyzing the variations and conserved regions in the s protein of group 2b sars-like covs shows conserved sites on the s2 region that could be targeted in broad-based therapeutics against multiple covs dr baric stressed that there is a large reservoir of sars-like and mers-like covs poised for emergence in humans two priorities are immediate vaccine candidates specific for sars-cov-2 and development of broad-based vaccines protective against antigenically distinct covs destined to emerge in the future key priorities for the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccine include characterization the sars-cov-2 neutralizing epitope map identification of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing epitopes identification of putative enhancing epitopes that might potentiate disease in vivo identification of key t cell epitopes across outbred populations and determination of correlates of protective immunity barney graham md phd deputy director of the nih vaccine research center presented data on the immunogenicity and neutralizing efficacy of truncated spike s antigens with a focus on sars-cov-2 class i fusion proteins such as s protein are common among enveloped viruses including rsv parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses and have been successfully stabilized in their pre-fusion conformations this approach has been shown to preserve neutralization-sensitive epitopes avoid antibodies that are non-neutralizing and improve expression in transfected cells thus aiding in manufacturing and immunogenicity of gene-based vectors the s proteins of sars-cov-1 and mers-cov have both been successfully stabilized by introducing two proline residues to the top of the central helix preventing heptad assembly and stabilizing the s2 region and the entire s protein as a result figure 1
 46 the sars-cov-2 s protein structure was solved shortly after its emergence and shows similar structure and mobility as the sars-cov-1 s 47 the timing from first knowledge of sars-cov-2 to the beginning of the phase 1 study was a remarkable sixty-five days the advantages of mrna vaccines include ability to create a highly precise type of protein to elicit the correct antibodies to elicit t cell responses that are th1 predominant and the rapidity of manufacturing of course disadvantages include the novel nature of both mrna and dna vaccines without any licensed vaccine with either technology to date and lack of experience for mass production therefore multiple platforms for sars-cov-2 are under development that mitigate against some of the potential disadvantages of nucleic acid vaccines although mrna and dna vaccines elicit t cell responses without adjuvants adjuvants may be important for subunit and whole cell inactivated vaccines to increase their immunogenicity and drive an immune response that could limit the risk of disease enhancement multiple sars-cov-2 vaccines are in development including vectored vaccines whole cell inactivated vaccines and recombinant protein vaccines the experts discussed how the choice of adjuvants will be important for both efficacy and safety with these platforms dr arnaud didierlaurent from the centre of vaccinology at the university of geneva presented background on the effects of different adjuvants on animal and human immune responses several adjuvants are now being used in commercial vaccines or are in clinical development 48 oil-in-water emulsions such as mf59 or as03 have been shown to increase the breadth of the antibody repertoire binding affinity and affinity maturation when compared to unadjuvanted vaccines 49 50 in human studies with influenza vaccines h5n1 vaccine adjuvanted with mf59 squalene-based emulsion increased the levels of h5-specific antibody for subclasses igg1 and igg3 and the binding to fcr2 but not to fcr3 when compared to alum adjuvanted vaccines this demonstrates that the use of an adjuvant can skew the functionality profile of antigen-specific antibodies with the potential to activate different innate effectors based on their fcr expression 51 use of squalene-based emulsion vaccines for influenza have also been shown to increase cd4 t cell response frequencies and cross-reactivity even if pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies are present prior to immunization such adjuvants could activate nave b cells and promote the adaptability of memory b cells 52 53 54 55 in addition to antibodies adjuvants can promote cellular responses human malaria challenge studies provided early evidence that the choice of adjuvantscombined with the malaria antigen rtss was critical in achieving optimal protection and highlighted the importance of cellular response 56 more recently studies with hepatitis b surface antigen hbs vaccine adjuvanted with as01 as03 as04 or alum showed that vaccines formulated with as01 and as03 induced the highest antibody levels while as01 promoted best hbs-specific cd4 t cell response 57 these differences were associated with the magnitude of the initial inflammatory response triggered by the different adjuvanted formulations 57 58 interestingly although the level of cd4 t cell response was lower in the alum group compared to the as01 group both adjuvants led to similar memory subset profiles and cytokine production profiles polyfunctionality and neither induced th2 cytokines nor a cd8 induced response upon peptide restimulation this indicates that use of alum may not necessarily lead to th2 skewing in humans recently a number of systems biology studies have revealed that specific early signatures eg interferon-dependent pathways induced by adjuvanted vaccines are often associated with protective responses 59 but the impact of these early signals on functional features of antibodies and the quality of t cell response is not well established yet although adjuvant selection is best performed in early clinical studies animal models could be useful is determining immune profile of adjuvanted vaccines nhp models are well-established to assess immune responses to vaccination and elicit immune responses in closer parallel to humans than mice for example in non-human primates adjuvant choice affects antibody half-life antibody glycosylation and antibody binding to fcrs indicating effects on both antibody quality and function like what is observed in humans 60 when adeno-based vectored vaccines are given to humans or nhps both groups develop similar antibody function profiles additionally nhps and humans tend to show similarities in terms of ranking of adjuvants and innate immune pathways triggered by adjuvants overall nhps could be utilized to evaluate covid-19 vaccine candidates with and without adjuvants and guide in the selection of vaccines that elicit desired attributes that could reduce the risk of vaccine-mediated enhanced disease given the unprecedented demand for an effective vaccine the use of adjuvants may be critical for subunit vaccines in providing antigen-dose sparing increased immunogenicity breadth and duration of response potentially eliciting cross-protection against new cov strains and minimizing the risk of enhanced disease following the presentations attendees participated in discussion of the suggested consensus statements and all attendees were asked to comment on the draft statements available online these comments were reviewed and discussed again on the second day of the meeting and resulted in the summary consensus statement that follows 
murine models for assessment of vaccine-related disease enhancement
sars-cov-2 has a low affinity for murine ace2 receptor and murine models will require the use of hace2 transgenic mice preferably with a knock-in approach preliminary data indicate the possibility of infecting hace2 transgenic mice with demonstration of viral replication and mild lung lesions mouse adaptation of sars-cov-2 as done with sars-cov-1 will likely be required to obtain a virus that causes more severe disease in mice models that develop acute lung injury with some lethality and that mimic the human condition will be important for evaluating vaccine safetyprevious studies from sars-cov-1 and mers-cov indicated that some vaccines especially those using whole inactivated virus could enhance the disease induced in mice challenged with sars-cov-1 or mers-cov the lung lesions were highly inflammatory with a dominance of eosinophil infiltration and occurred in animals despite presence of a neutralizing antibody response and reduced challenge virus replication in the lungs such studies have not yet been completed for sars-cov2in mice this immunopathology was considered a consequence of a dominant th2 type response to the vaccine antigens it was not seen after including adjuvants eg cpg in the vaccine or other vaccine formulations known to drive immune responses towards th1 the timing of challenge after vaccination may be critical it would be of major interest to explore the outcome following challenge at later timepoints when antibodies are significantly decayingone should be aware of the potential confounding effect of cell-culture excipients in the vaccine and challenge strain material it is known that impurities such as fetal calf serum in the preclinical vaccine preparation may induce eosinophil influx in any mouse model if the challenge strain also contains the same excipientsin these models characterization of the immune response to the candidate vaccine eg igg isotypes th2 markers may have some predictive valueother small animal models which can be infected by sars-cov-2 can be considered eg ferret hamster development of small animal models of severe disease will also inform studies of vaccine-enhanced disease
 
non-human primate models for assessment of vaccine-mediated enhanced disease
non-human primates nhp are of primary interest in view of their ace2 homology with hace2 preliminary studies indicate the possibility of inducing some covid-19 lung pathological features after infection without clinical signs in rhesus macaques african green monkeys may be more susceptible to covid-19 but the model suffers from some limitations eg access genetic polymorphismprevious studies with sars candidate vaccines have suggested a risk of enhanced pathology in nhps after viral challenge eosinophilic infiltrates were not prominent the mechanism is still incompletely defined but there is evidence for a role of non-neutralizing antibodies non- or incompletely neutralizing antibodies may contribute toothe formation of pathogenic immune complexes andofc-mediated viral capture by monocytesmacrophages that may favor excessive t-cell activation and inflammation
enhanced pathology was seen following passive transfer of igg from immunized nhps
 
general considerations on animal models
although existing animal models of covid-19 imperfectly reproduce the human disease they appear useful for assessing the risk of disease enhancement vaccine responses are closer to human responses in nhps than in mice therefore it is likely that data obtained from nhp studies are more significant however there is an urgent need to standardize the nhp model read-out of disease enhancement timing of challenge age and to include appropriate controls ie a vaccine that induces enhanced pathology and disease and a sufficient number of animals to be confident of findings in outbred species it is important to control for potential co-infection including with other coronaviruses in all non-spf modelspotential markers of safety in these animal models could includeothe relative levels of neutralizing vs non-neutralizing antibodiesoantibody affinityot-cell response profileoquantitative virology in the upper and lower respiratory tractocharacterization of lung histopathology with immunohistochemistry for viral antigen and immune cell markerspassive transfer in nhps of human antibodies generated during phase 1 trials followed by viral challenge could be considered to assess the risk of disease enhancementchallenge of immunized animals with a closely related heterologous cov strains may assess the risk of enhancement during future outbreaksin case of disease enhancement in-depth studies in animal models may give some indications on the mechanism of immunopathology they can inform human trial designers on the critical immunological risk markers to be monitored in phase 1 trialsbased on previous experience with sars and other viral diseases it may be useful to evaluate the risk of disease enhancement for covid-19 vaccines particularly those including whole virions or n protein in an established nhp model before advanced clinical development
 
during the vaccine design session the group of experts suggested that consideration should be given to the following
caution should be observed when developing vaccines to avoid inducing predominant th2 responses and non-neutralizing antibodiesvaccines inducing strong neutralizing antibodies predominant th1 responses and balanced cd4cd8 and polyfunctional t cell responses are less likely to induce immunopathologygiven what will be the unprecedented demand for an effective vaccine the use of adjuvants may be critical for sub-unit vaccines in providing increased immunogenicity breadth of response dose sparing duration of response potentially cross-protection against new cov strains and possibly minimize the risk of enhanced disease preference should be given to th1-driving adjuvants with an established safety profile in humansunderstanding of the role of cross-reacting antibodies from prior coronavirus infections may have on natural disease caused by sars-cov-2 or influence the risk of enhanced disease following vaccination may inform vaccine designdata are needed on whether antibody waning could increase the risk of enhanced disease on exposure to virus in the long term
 
it was the opinion of the experts that animal data to support clinical development could address
post-vaccination neutralizing antibody responses and t cell analysis to demonstrate a th1 responsepost-vaccination challenge data from nhps with careful evaluation for immunopathology and quantitative virology in the animalssmall animal data may also provide important supporting evidence of safety and hamster ferret and mouse models are likely to be available for developerswhere possible immunopathology experiments with a positive control eg formalin inactivated alum-adjuvanted sars-cov-1 or sars-cov-2 vaccine and a mock-immunized negative control will provide best guidance it was felt that it will be important to establish broadly accepted endpoints and scoring systems to allow comparison of various vaccine candidates who is working on this issuefor vaccine constructs likely to induce a predominant th2 response the group felt that animal studies should be considered before entering human phase 1 trials in more than one animal species including nhps where possible it was noted that the absence of a th2 response does not eliminate the risk of enhanced diseasefor vaccine constructs which are already known to induce neutralizing antibody and th1 responses it was the consensus of the group that while phase 1 studies are cautiously proceeding with careful review of safety data animal studies run in parallel could provide useful information for the further clinical developmentsuggestive data in animal models should not by default prevent clinical development of vaccine candidates potential risk should be thoroughly evaluated by developers and regulators on a vaccine product-specific basis

 
regarding phase 1 clinical trials it was the opinion of the experts that
since not all studies that have begun or are about to begin will prescreen to determine preimmunization serostatus of participants although this shall be determined retrospectively appropriate baseline blood specimens should be obtained and stored because the virus is spreading rapidly such specimens will allow assessment of the immune response in both seronegative and seropositive persons as both are likely to be vaccinatedlevel of neutralizing antibodies and determination of the relative ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies will be important to assess the potential risk of enhanced disease also detection of initial priming that includes cd8 t cells andor a cd4 th1 biased response is likely to mitigate the risk of disease enhancement determination of memory responses will be useful particularly if sars-cov-2 continues to circulateconsideration should be given to the use of post-vaccination sera from vaccinees which could be used for antibody transfer studies in animals to look for enhanced disease and for evidence of cross-protection against other coronavirusesmonitoring for enhanced disease in immunized participants may require longer follow-up than is usual in phase 1 trials but need not delay phase 2 trialsinvestigators on the call requested frequent updating with both preclinical and evolving clinical data that are being developed by the different academic and industrial developers to help in decision-making about the various vaccine clinical trials creation of a central information hub was encouraged for this purposeparticipants on the call expressed the need for standardization of protocols data collection forms critical assays including reagents and biobanking of samples from initial clinical trials to allow future re-assay once standards are agreed to and enable comparison of results across trials
 
concluding remarks
the group of experts considers that the demonstration of some disease enhancement with any candidate vaccine after viral challenge in animal models should not necessarily represent a no-go signal for deciding whether to progress into early trials in clinical development of a covid-19 vaccinecontinuous monitoring of this risk during clinical trials in an epidemic context will be neededeach observed effect should be discussed by the developers with their regulators who will ultimately define the actual requirements for clinical studies
 the considerations in this document should be interpreted as general scientific remarks based on current knowledge to inform a research agenda that could be beneficial for vaccines in development these considerations are not of a regulatory nature and cannot in any sense replace the need for proper regulatory consultations on the requirements for vaccines clinical trials vaccine developers are

candidate sars vaccines summary of a technical meeting 2526 august 2005 london uk anjeanette roberts john wood kanta subbarao morag ferguson david wood thomas cherian   severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a severe respiratory illness caused by the sars coronavirus sars-cov 1 the disease emerged in the guangdong province of china in late 2002 2 and spread to 29 countries mostly within asia although europe and north america were also affected notably toronto canada the epidemic was finally controlled by july 2003 through strict implementation of quarantine and isolation procedures culling of wild animals in live exotic animal markets and international collaboration under the coordination of who 3 by the end of the outbreak the cdc and who reported 8098 cases with a 96 case fatality rate 4 only sporadic cases have been reported since then mainly linked to laboratory exposure a novel virus was isolated in vero cells from the respiratory secretions from a patient with sars 5 6 sequence analysis showed that it was a previously unrecognized coronavirus sars-cov 7 8 9 serological and genetic evidence supports a zoonotic origin of sars-cov 10 11 animal traders working with masked palm civets in china had high prevalence for sars-cov antibody although they had no history of sars-like disease sars-cov-like viruses that were isolated from civets and raccoon dogs had more than 99 homology with human sars-cov with major differences found in orf8 whose deletion has been suggested to represent a sign of adaptation to humans 12 only four amino acid residues in the receptor glycoprotein ace2-binding domain of the viral spike protein differ between the human epidemic sars-cov strains and civet strains but they cause more than a 1000-fold difference in binding affinity to the ace2 molecule 13 14 although a high prevalence of sars-like coronaviruses were found in chinese horseshoe bats 15 16 their great genetic diversity makes it difficult to identify which one might be the ancestor of sars-cov and to decide with certainty whether bats indeed are the animal reservoir of the virus sars-cov infection exhibits a wide clinical course characterized mostly by fever dyspnea lymphopenia and lower respiratory infection often with concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea 17 18 pathology in sars patients has been associated with diffuse alveolar damage epithelial cell proliferation and multinucleated giant cell infiltrates of epithelial or macrophage origin suggestive of syncytium-like formation in the lung the virus can be recovered from peripheral blood mononuclear cells respiratory secretions stools urine and even sweat for a review see 19 sars vaccine development efforts were initiated very rapidly after the identification of the etiologic agent even though the immune correlates of protection were not known research efforts to identify protective antigens and to develop animal models were undertaken in parallel with efforts to develop candidate vaccines 20 drawing on experience with animal coronavirus vaccines and using several vaccine strategies including inactivated virus vaccines purified subunit vaccines plasmid dna and viral vector-based vaccines as well as virus-like particles much effort has been made to identify appropriate animal models for sars-cov replication and pathogenesis several research groups have shown that mice 21 22 ferrets 23 hamsters 24 and nonhuman primates 25 26 27 28 29 30 support replication of sars-cov with varying degrees of associated disease these animal models were used for the evaluation of candidate vaccines and the common conclusion that has emerged from the evaluation of several vaccines is that the 180 kda viral spike protein s is the only significant neutralization antigen 31 32 33 34 and the only one to elicit protective immunity in animal models 21 35 36 37 38 39 40 the s protein can be divided into two domains by analogy with other coronavirus spike proteins an n-terminal s1 domain which contains the receptor-binding site and neutralization epitopes and a c-terminal s2 domain which forms the membrane-anchored stalk region and contains a putative fusion peptide followed by two heptad repeats predicted to form a six-helix coiled-coil bundle 41 in the absence of clinical cases of sars candidate vaccines will have to be evaluated for efficacy in animal models the united states fda animal rule states that when efficacy studies in humans are not feasible vaccines may be approved based on animal data alone provided the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease is reasonably well-understood as is its prevention or reduction by the vaccine moreover the protective effect of the vaccine should be demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans the endpoint of animal studies should be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans ie enhancement of survival or reduction in major morbidity and the data generated should allow selection of an effective dose in humans at the present time it is uncertain whether the animal rule would apply to licensure of a sars vaccine however it is important to develop standardized animal models and immunological assays in preparation for this eventuality scientists at the who technical meeting on animal models and antibody assays for evaluating candidate sars vaccines held on 2526 august 2005 in south mimms uk discussed many aspects of research pertaining to the use of animal models in vaccine development including available animal models suitability of the various models correlates of protection critical components of potential vaccines and the potential for disease enhancement in vaccinated animals following exposure to sars-cov in addition standardization of antibody assays and the establishment of a who international standard for sars-cov antibody were also discussed this report endeavors to summarize the recommendations from this meeting based on consensus agreement recommendations for use of each animal model are given in section 2 below correlates of protection an overview of vaccine development and observations pertaining to potential disease enhancement are summarized in the following sections 3 4 5 6 in selecting animal models for vaccine evaluation it is important to remember the principle underlying the so called animal rule where data from more than one animal species is often required each animal species should contribute something different to our understanding of disease and protection at this time no single model offers a direct reproduction of what was seen in humans with sars pathology including pneumonitis alveolar edema and diffuse alveolar damage dad in humans is probably the most difficult element to reproduce in an animal model attention also should be given to the reduction of viral shedding because this would likely correlate with decreased risk of further spread of the disease among humans in using animal models to study aspects of sars-cov infection it must be emphasized that the kinetics of viral replication and appearance and resolution of pathological findings are much more rapid in animal models than in humans whichever animal model is employed special consideration should be given to the presence of co-existing pathogens the age of the animals and the routes of infection a sufficient number of time points and large enough number of animals should be used to allow statistical evaluation the strain of sars-cov used also could be of importance it should be emphasized that different species may prove useful for studying different aspects of sars-cov whereas vaccines or antivirals may be addressed in many models pathogenesis is best evaluated in those animal models for which immunological tools and reagents are available for detailed analysis of the immune response to the vaccine this includes inbred mice and rhesus and cynomolgus macaques it may actually be worthwhile to enhance the virulence of a sars-cov isolate by serial passages in an animal model to produce a challenge virus stock for vaccine studies that would elicit more reproducible disease in the animals if a highly virulent host-adapted virus were to become available such as a mouse-adapted or a monkey-adapted sars-cov strain demonstration of the capacity of vaccines to protect against challenge with these more virulent strains would provide an almost ideal animal model different models may also need to be employed to evaluate pathogenesis versus immunogenicity for pathogenesis studies in animal models mortality is not required as a read-out it would be ideal to develop animal models with comparable levels of mortality to that seen in humans 10 overall including the increased mortality at increased age 50  age 60 the optimal result would be to demonstrate efficacy of vaccines or antivirals in sars-cov animal models that mimic human morbidity and mortality and that show protection without vaccine-associated immunopathology inbred mouse strains balbc c57bl6 129svev stat1 support sars-cov replication and can develop pneumonitis 129s but pneumonia and clinical symptoms are only observed in older balbc mice 24 the mouse model is suitable for immunogenicity and efficacy studies of vaccines prolonged viral replication dissemination of virus to liver and spleen and accompanying pathology are seen in stat1 mice these mice therefore also are suitable for studies of pathogenesis and evaluation of antiviral drugs specific pathogen-free spf animals must be used their age can be either 48 weeks or over 12 months and should be specified the number of animals included must be sufficient for statistical analysis and should include mock-infected controls a variety of sars-cov strains has been tested in mice including urbani frankfurt hku-39849 tor-2 and the mouse-adapted sars-cov strain ma-15 these were inoculated by the intranasal in route under light anesthesia 21 42 using a dose of 105tcid50 in 50 lmouse critical time points for specimen collections are days 2 peak titer and 5 post-infection pi for quantitative virology days 3 and 5 pi for the study of interstitial pneumonitis and dad in aged mice inflate lungs with 10 neutral-buffered formalin and day 9 for resolution golden syrian hamsters are an excellent animal model because they demonstrate high levels of sars-cov replication and develop pneumonitis hamsters are suitable for vaccine efficacy immunoprophylaxis and treatment studies 24 in contrast with balbc mice in which the virus is detected only in the respiratory tract and is cleared by day 5 pi hamsters demonstrate a longer duration of viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract some transient viremia spread of the virus to liver and spleen and most significantly inflammation of respiratory tissues 21 24 spf animals older than 5 weeks of age should be used in sufficient number for statistical analysis and study design should include mock-infected animals the animals can be housed in pairs or by three if the experiment is to last less than 46 weeks reserve space should be available to separate the animals in case of fights males and littermates tend to fight less virus strains that have been tested in hamsters are urbani frankfurt and hku-39849 virus should be administered by the in route under light anesthesia using a dose of 103tcid50 in 100 lhamster as an outcome of efficacy studies quantitative virology should be preferred over quantitative pcr for pathology studies one can grade pathology as none mild moderate or severe as per roberts et al 24 critical time points for specimen collection are days 2 or 3 pi peak viral titer and 7 clearance for quantitative virology studies and days 5 pi consolidation and pneumonitis and 14 or 21 resolution for pathology studies lung there is evidence from one study that ferrets support sars-cov replication and develop pulmonary lesions 23 but according to another study the animals remain asymptomatic in the presence of sars-cov replication 38 in view of these conflicting data the ferret model needs to be further studied to determine its optimal utility for vaccine efficacy and immune prophylaxis studies additional studies are needed to define the extent of biological variability of the model and the possible role of co-pathogens that may contribute to the variability observed between different laboratories animals aged 6 months or older should be used although not well documented more consistent viral replication pathology and clinical symptoms seem to be observed in older animals the animals should be screened for viral co-pathogens aleutian mink disease respiratory viruses hepatitis viruses and others the route of inoculation may be in or it but not iv the dose of virus strains tor-2 hku-39849 sufficient to ensure reproducibility of infection in all animals is likely to be 105pfu or moreferret again quantitative virology is preferred over qrt-pcr for pathology studies the same recommendations apply as for nonhuman primate studies see below slides should be shared between pathologists to develop a scoring system regarding specimen collection of respiratory tissues further studies are needed to establish how much variation occurs in samples from different lobes of the lungs critical time points are day 3 pi for quantitative virology and days 45 pi for pathology studies pneumonitis nhps support sars-cov replication and develop pneumonitis with a variable degree of clinical symptoms depending upon the species employed no single nhp species is preferred at this time the number of animals in a given study needs to be large enough to account for animal-to-animal variability a sample of 4 or 5 animals is not sufficient in view of the cost of the experiments challenge studies should be limited to those vaccine candidates that are most promising using larger sample sizes 1012 animalsgroup and avoiding animals with free-range periods in life if possible immunological responses are best studied in species for which microarrays and reagents for identifying immune components are available such as rhesus or cynomolgus macaques however the limited viral replication observed in cynomolgus macaques might be a disadvantage in selecting this species for studies other recommended nhp species are the common marmoset and african green monkeys agms chlorocebus aethiops sabeus the country of origin may play an important role and should be specified eg philippines cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis china rhesus macaca mulatta brazil marmosets callithrix jacchus etc prior to the experiment the animals should be housed indoor to limit exposure to potential co-pathogens they should be screened for parasites strongyloides pneumonyssus simicola lung mites and for possible viral co-pathogens retroviruses respiratory viruses adenoviruses the sars-cov strains tested in nhp models are hku-39849 cynos pumc rhesus and urbani marmosets and agms these were inoculated by the respiratory route in it at a dose of 106pfu or morenhp here again quantitative virology is preferred over qrt-pcr for pathology studies it would be an obvious advantage that laboratories share pathology slides for review by different pathologists in order to develop a scoring system specimens of respiratory tissues should be collected but further studies are needed to establish how much variation occurs in samples from different lobes of the lungs as was done and reported for african green monkeys agms 28 critical time points are days 24 pi for quantitative virology in cynomolgus macaques and agms and later than day 4 pi for rhesus macaques of chinese origin for collection of tissues for histopathological analyses days 24 pi are optimal for cynomolgus macaques and agms and later than day 4 pi for rhesus macaques due to limitations of immunological reagents including microarray assays now available research may be limited to rhesus and cynomolgus macaques data on other animal models are insufficient for consideration for use in sars-cov vaccine and antiviral evaluations 43 44 45 any additional model other than the four listed above section 221 to section 224 would require thorough characterization including viral replication data and histopathological analysis of sars-cov-infected and mock-infected animals of the same age and gender viral replication and histopathological data in any new animal model should be reminiscent of at least some aspect of sars in humans although all the correlates of protection from sars associated disease have not been identified in human infections neutralizing antibodies are present in convalescent human serum antibodies to sars-cov spike s protein have been shown to prevent virus entry and neutralize virus infectivity in vitro
32 46 prophylactically administered monoclonal antibodies and passively transferred sars-cov hyper-immune sera have been shown to prevent sars-cov infection and associated disease following sars-cov challenge of naive mice and hamsters 21 34 47 48 49 monoclonal antibodies administered therapeutically ie post-infection also have been shown to limit viral replication and reduce associated disease in hamsters 50 although cell mediated immunity may have a protective role in viral clearance or resolution of disease work in animal models shows that antibody alone is effective for prevention and treatment of sars thus mice immunized with live-recombinant vaccines expressing the sars-cov spike protein using rabies virus 51 vesicular stomatitis virus vsv 52 adenovirus ad5 27 53 or attenuated vaccinia virus mva 36 38 as a vector as well as mice immunized with dna vaccines expressing the s gene 37 54 developed neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov and were protected against sars-cov challenge similar findings were reported after mucosal immunization of hamsters and agms using a bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 bpiv3 vector expressing the sars cov s gene 33 39 several whole inactivated virus and recombinant protein candidate vaccines also have been developed and shown to elicit a neutralizing antibody response that provided protection against infectious challenge 55 56 57 58 59 60 in addition passively administered sera from vaccinated animals prevented sars-cov infection upon subsequent challenge of nave mice demonstrating that antibodies induced by these vaccines did confer protection 37 52 the neutralizing antibody titer that is necessary to achieve protection in humans exposed to sars-cov is however still not known it was recommended that when evaluating vaccine efficacy in future animal experiments the challenge virus should be administered at two different time-points once when post-immunization neutralizing antibody titers are high and later when neutralizing antibody titers have waned or are low it also was suggested that viral titers and pathology should be evaluated at two different time points specific times points for sample collection are given for each animal model in section 2 above previous observations of disease enhancement have been reported for human viral pathogens and shown to be due to antibody-mediated enhancement of virus entry for reviews see 61 62 enhanced disease and mortality have been observed in kittens immunized against or infected with a type-i coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv when subsequently exposed to fipv infection 63 64 65 aggravated fip is apparently a result of enhanced viral entry into macrophages mediated by sub-neutralizing antibody levels 66 children vaccinated with inactivated respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccines developed serious disease on subsequent exposure to rsv 67 68 69 individuals exposed to one of the four serotypes of dengue virus developed severe disease when subsequently infected with a second different serotype 70 71 enhanced disease following rsv vaccine or dengue infection occur by different mechanisms than fipv in view of such examples of enhanced disease following infection in a vaccinated host there has been heightened concern that a similar phenomenon could occur with sars-cov vaccines it was highly recommended therefore that known mechanisms of disease enhancement observed with other viruses and especially with other coronaviruses should be examined in sars-cov infections especially in vaccinated animals although none of the studies to date have shown enhanced respiratory disease following sars-cov challenge in previously immunized animals further studies in this area are warranted in view of some of the available in vitro data antibodies against human sars-cov isolates were shown to enhance the entry of pseudo-typed viruses expressing the civet sars-like cov-spike protein into a human renal adenocarcinoma cell line 786-o enhancement was only demonstrated at the level of entry but not of replication 72 this phenomenon was seen with pseudo-typed lentiviruses expressing sars-cov spike protein of civet sequence specificity but not with pseudo-typed viruses expressing spike proteins of human sars-cov isolates it also was not observed with human isolates of sars-cov the role of enhanced viral entry as observed in these in vitro studies has not been related to any known component of human disease or infection in vivo however given that sars-cov may replicate albeit poorly in human pbmcs 73 74 in vitro experiments looking for antibody-enhancement of sars-cov replication in human cells eg macrophages and b-cells should be performed several groups have studied sars-cov infection in animals in the presence of neutralizing and sub-neutralizing levels of sars-cov anti-sera or anti sars-cov s-protein monoclonal antibodies but no evidence of enhanced respiratory disease has been observed however foci of hepatic necrosis were noted following sars-cov challenge in mva-sars-s immunized ferrets 38 although these findings are worrisome several questions were raised regarding the significance of the observation the mva-sars-s vaccine used in these experiments was poorly immunogenic in the ferrets the question of whether there could have been any co-pathogen in the animals was raised it also would be important to know if the observed phenomenon depends on the mva vector or on the animal model it was strongly urged therefore that the experiment be repeated in ferrets additional experiments in nonhuman primates and hamsters looking for evidence of enhanced respiratory and hepatic diseases upon vaccination and challenge were also encouraged several candidate sars vaccines that are at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development are being developed worldwide in china alone three companies have been given regulatory approval for the clinical evaluation of a candidate sars vaccine it is important therefore to be able to compare data from each of the candidate vaccines which in turn requires international standardization of the immunological assays used for the evaluation of these vaccines the accepted method of international standardization is to employ a who international standard is which allows comparison of results from different laboratories 75 this is essential for establishing international requirements for vaccines diagnostics or therapeutics an is is prepared from material bearing a close resemblance to the samples being assayed the material is distributed in glass ampoules with high precision and reproducibility and then freeze dried it is important that a sufficient number of ampoules 20003000 be prepared so as to provide for about 10 years of use and that the activity of the contents remain stable over this period the process of establishing a who is involves an international collaborative study in which the candidate is is compared with other samples if the results of the tests are suitable the candidate is assigned a provisional arbitrary unitage a report is distributed for approval by study participants and for eventual approval by the who expert committee on biological standardization ecbs the preparation storage and distribution of over 90 of is have been undertaken by the national institute for biological standards and control nibsc at south mimms uk which is a who laboratory for biological standards nibsc has developed in the past several who iss for calibration of the antibody response against virus vaccines including iss for antibodies against dengue hepatitis a virus hav 76 hepatitis b virus hbv measles 77 polio rabies 78 rubella and smallpox a candidate standard against human papilloma virus-16 hpv-16 is under evaluation the corresponding iss were used for a variety of antibody assays including virus neutralisation vn haemagglutination-inhibition single radial diffusion enzyme-linked immunoassay and radio-immunoassay antibody iss are most useful in epidemiological studies and in clinical trials their use allows correlates of immunity and potency requirements of prophylactic and therapeutic products to be expressed in international units ius data from several collaborative studies demonstrate that use of an is generally reduces the level of variability between assay results however there may be problems in using iss due to the complex array of antibody populations in each serum and the different sensitivity of different assay systems examples of potential problems can be found in hbv and parvovirus b19 studies 79 which showed that different assay kits gave different results even when the is was included in the assays another issue is the degree of antigenic homology between the viral antigen used for the preparation of the is and the virus used in the assays in a jev collaborative study a candidate antibody is which had been prepared from the sera of vaccinees immunized with an inactivated vaccine that was antigenically different from some of the viruses used in vn assays demonstrated that the response to at least some inactivated vaccine is strain specific and the candidate is was consequently not established by the who ecbs whether a panel of monoclonal antibodies to sars-cov could be used to prepare an is is an attractive alternative which should be explored significant progress with standardisation of sars-cov antibody assays had been made in china with the development of a national antibody standard in order to develop the national standard sera were collected from 20 convalescent sars patients who were found to have sars-cov vn antibody titers ranging from undetectable to 1203 one serum sample was selected for further evaluation based on cross-reactivity with four sars-cov strains and on western blot analysis this serum was freeze dried in 05 ml aliquots and was then assessed for stability by vn assays the chinese standard was assigned a vn titer of 527 with 95 confidence limits of 476622 a further important development in china was the preparation of human immunoglobulin for treatment of sars patients national guidelines have been prepared for collection of plasma quality control testing and standardisation of assays three chinese manufacturers have been licensed for preparation of sars immunoglobulin the source material was plasma from convalescent patients at more than 28 days after infection all were in good health and their plasma tested negative for blood-borne agents plasma samples were processed by a combination of cold ethanol fractionation and ultrafiltration in september 2003 three lots of igg were produced and assayed by nationally-agreed procedures the stock of immunoglobulin currently available is sufficient to treat 100 patients monoclonal antibodies have not yet been considered for treatment purposes in china the importance of assessing immunogenicity of candidate sars-cov vaccines using vn assays is well acknowledged but the variety of vn tests in use is a significant problem since there is at this time no consensus on the most sensitive specific and reproducible assay system it is therefore desirable to establish an antibody is to serve as a basis of comparison in all vn assays the most important activity at this time is to obtain a suitable source of antibody a number of options can be considered such as convalescent human sera post-immunization human sera monoclonal antibodies or hyperimmune animal sera as an example the availability of a suitable source of serum from convalescent patients in hong kong needs to be explored although antibody levels in these individuals are probably quite low by now it also would be important that other assays than vn be included in the collaborative study and that the impact of sars-cov strain variation be examined by using different sars-cov strains andor sera with different specificities the centralized facility for aids reagents cfar which is based at nibsc could be a suitable model for a sars-cov repository 80 the cfar was established in 1989 to support aids vaccine research and it is now eu-funded 81 there are currently 2000 reagents available including peptides recombinant proteins human seraplasma monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies expression systems cdna clones and viruses a comparison can be drawn between sars-cov and hiv vn assays currently there are several different hiv neutralization assays formats under consideration and a lack of agreement on the most suitable assay the cfar is supporting a joint whoeu project neunet to evaluate and standardize hiv vn assays in an international collaborative study in the usa a sars-cov repository has been established on behalf of the american type culture collection atcc in order to meet the needs of biodefence and the threat of emerging infections 82 the type of reagents stored includes viruses peptide arrays monoclonal antibodies and proteins it is hoped that an active collaboration can be established between niaid and nibsc in order to meet the expanding needs of the sars research community based on the discussion at the meeting the following recommendations were made with respect to standardization of the immunological assays for sars vaccine evaluation1a who repository for sars-cov reagents ought to be developed collaboration between niaid and nibsc is recommended to achieve this goal2consensus must be reached for the reagents to be given priority in the repository3an international standard for sars-cov antibody is needed4the most suitable source of antibody for the is is convalescent human sera but post-vaccination human sera could also be used5a protocol for an international collaborative study aimed at validating the is should be developed and distributed to prospective participants6collaborative study participants should be asked about their assay capabilities eg number of sera virus strains handled etc7the proposed is collaborative study should include a core set of antibody preparations to be distributed and assayed in each laboratory eg monoclonal antibodies animal sera other human sera8tests should be conducted using the same strain of sars-cov in each laboratory but the different genetic lineages of sars-cov should also be represented in the study
 biosafety issues associated with sars-cov vaccine development stem from the reports of laboratory-acquired infections in china sanofi pasteur has adopted bsl 4 practices and bsl 3 equipment eg class 2 or 3 microbiological safety cabinets with respiratory protective equipment for the preparation of sars-cov vaccines of note is the fact that sars-cov appears to be quite resistant to normal methods of virus decontamination jf saluzzo personal communication who has developed guidance both general 83 and specific for handling sars specimens 84 the rapid success in the development of immunogenic and protective vaccines against sars using a variety of platforms is encouraging but should be tempered with concerns about the possibility of enhanced disease following exposure in vaccinated individuals 85 concerns mainly stem from reports of enhanced disease in fipv-immunized or -infected kittens 63 66 from observations that antibodies elicited against certain coronaviruses mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of viral entry 65 and from the observation of inflammatory foci in liver tissue following sars-cov challenge in mva-sars-s vaccinated ferrets 38 candidate sars vaccines will need to be evaluated in more than one animal model they also will need to be thoroughly evaluated for the duration of the antibody response they induce as well as for the breadth of their protective efficacy against different strains of sars-cov the implications of the sequence heterogeneity among sars-cov strains are difficult to test at this time because the most divergent strains civet sars-like viruses have not been recovered in culture validation and international standardization of immunological assays for the evaluation of candidate sars vaccines are essential to compare data across different trials this requires the establishment of international standards for sars-cov antibody and a repository for sars-cov reagents with an international collaborative study to validate the iss the establishment of the repository by who in collaboration with nibsc and niaid was recommended 

  middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccines current status and novel approaches nisreen okba ma v raj stalin bart haagmans l   coronaviruses are the largest positive sense single stranded rna viruses there are six human coronaviruses hcov to date hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov prior to the sars-cov epidemic in 20022003 covs were known to cause mild respiratory infections in humans sars-cov on the other hand infected around 8000 cases causing severe respiratory disease with a 10 fatality rate 1 ten years later mers-cov emerged in the human population also to cause severe respiratory infection 2 in contrast to the sars-cov epidemic which was contained within one year mers-cov still continues to cause outbreaks with increasing geographical distribution four years after its first identification as of march 2nd 2017 1905 cases in 27 countries have been reported to the who with 677 deaths accounting for a 35 case fatality rate httpwwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven like sars-cov mers-cov emerged as a result of zoonotic introduction to the human population despite its close genome similarity with bat coronavirus hku4 and hku5 2 accumulating serological and molecular evidence pointed to dromedary camels as the most probable reservoir for mers-cov 3 4 5 this poses a continuous risk of virus spill-over to people in contact with camels such as those working in slaughter houses and animal farms evidenced by the presence of mers-cov antibodies in sera of those individuals 6 7 nosocomial transmission however accounts for the majority of mers-cov cases reported in outbreaks 8 9 10 although a substantial part of infections that occur result in unrecognized asymptomatic or mild illnesses 11 thus in addition to camel contacts other highly-at-risk groups are healthcare workers and patient household contacts 8 12 13 considering the ongoing mers-cov outbreaks it is crucial to develop intervention measures among which vaccines play an important role despite the fact that the emergence of mers-cov and sars-cov has dramatically changed the way we view covs there is no licensed cov vaccine or therapeutic drug available to date 14 15 a cornerstone for rational vaccine design is defining the determinants of immune protection accumulating data from studies done so far on mers-cov and other coronaviruses revealed that a combination of both virus-specific humoral and cellular immune responses is required for full protection against coronaviruses especially neutralizing antibodies are considered key players in the protective immunity against covs neutralizing monoclonal antibodies mabs reduced viral loads in mers-cov receptor-transduced mice rabbits and macaques 16 17 18 19 similarly convalescent camel sera increased virus clearance and decreased lung pathological outcomes in mice with an efficacy directly proportional to anti-mers-cov-neutralizing antibody nab titers 20 also polyclonal sera produced in transchromosomic bovines protected mice against mers-cov challenge 21 evidence for the protective role of antibodies also comes from recent studies analyzing immune responses in patients that survived or succumbed to mers-cov although neutralizing antibodies were only weakly inversely correlated to viral loads serum antibody responses were higher in survivors compared to fatal cases but viral rna was not eliminated from the lungs 22 23 administration of convalescent sera however did not lead to significant reduction in viral loads 22 24 the presence of mucosal iga abs on the other hand was found to influence infectious virus isolation 25 besides humoral immunity cellular immune responses are also considered to play a crucial role in protection against coronaviruses while b-cell deficient mice were able to clear mers-cov those lacking t-cells failed to eliminate the virus pointing out the crucial role of t-cells in viral clearance 26 this is supported by the observation that t-cells were able to protect aged mice against sars-cov infection 27 and the fact that a reduced t-cell count was associated with enhanced disease severity in sars patients 28 along with other studies these data highlight the importance of t-cells for virus clearance and protection against mers-cov 26 27 and sars-cov 29 30 it is also noteworthy to mention that while neither antibodies nor memory b cells were detectable 6-years post-infection 31 sars-cov-specific memory t-cells despite being low in frequency persisted up to 11 years post-recovery 32 nonetheless the protective capacity of such memory response is not known hence taking into account the waning of virus-specific humoral responses generating a long-lived memory t cell response through vaccination could be favorable but as proper b- and t-cell immune responses are required for efficient protection vaccination should target the induction of both at the moment we lack information concerning the longevity of anamnestic immune responses following mers-cov infection except for a recent study showing that antibody responses albeit reduced persisted up to 34 months post-infection 33 the role of immune responses in protection is also in line with the observed increased fatality among the aged population following mers-cov infection retrospective studies on mers-cov patients from saudia arabia and south korea have found a significant correlation between old age and mortality 8 13 34 35 36 a pattern that has been also reported for other respiratory viruses such as sars-cov 1 and influenza virus 37 this is most likely caused by immunosenescence a failure to produce protective immune response to new pathogens in elderly due to impaired antigen presentation altered function of tlrs and a reduced nave b and t cell repertoire 38 this age-related increase in mortality was also reported in sars-cov laboratory-infected animals that is mice and nonhuman primates nhps 39 40 and was associated with low neutralizing antibodies and poor t-cell responses 41 42 43 several factors that play a role in t-cell activation were also found to be dysregulated in an age-related manner age-related increase in phospholipase a2 group iid pla2g2d and prostaglandind2 in the lungs contributed to a diminished t-cell response and severe lung damage through diminishing respiratory dendritic cell dc migration 44 45 likewise adoptive transfer of t-cells to mice enhanced viral clearance and survival 29 highlighting the contribution of a reduced t-cell response in severe disease outcome these observations also highlight the need for more effective preventive measures for the elderly in this sense induction of a potent airway t-cell response may be crucial to protect against covs 27 thus a promising approach to protect against mers-cov-induced fatality is to enhance virus-specific tissue airway resident memory t-cell responses through intranasal vaccination because the spike protein and more specifically the s1 domain is highly divergent among different covs neutralizing antibodies only provide homotypic protection thus far the variability in the amino acid sequence of the spike protein observed among mers-cov strains is low 71 and circulating mers-cov strains did not show any significant variation in the serological reactivity 25 59 implying that the development of a vaccine that is effective against one strain is likely to be protective against all circulating strains another risk posed from the development of antibody escape variants is still present 72 73 although this is not likely to happen as mutations in two epitopes may be required and mutants that develop may have reduced viral fitness 73 74 while the rbd is considered an ideal vaccine candidate for mers-cov the spike s2 domain and n protein are more conserved and thus adaptive immune response directed against these proteins can potentially lay the basis for a more broadly acting coronavirus vaccine however evidence for cross reactive immune responses against different covs is limited to a few studies convalescent sars-cov patient sera weakly neutralized mers-cov 75 and sars-s reactive antisera showed low level neutralization of mers-cov 61 extra-rbd s1 or s2 epitopes could be responsible for this effect as some neutralizing epitopes have been identified in these regions of the s protein 58 62 these may not be as immunodominant as the rbd epitopes but could provide a rationale for the development of a cross protective cov epitope-focused vaccine a recent study also demonstrated the potential role of adaptive response against n protein in protection against mers-cov infection as this vaccine candidate produced a protective t-cell response against mers-cov challenge which was also partially protective against sars-cov 27 moreover infection of mice with sars-cov reduced mers-cov titers 5 days pi upon challenge suggesting the development of a cross reactive t-cell response 26 thus mapping and focusing the immune response towards these critical neutralizing and t-cell epitopes which could be subdominant may provide a way to induce immune responses with a broader activity against different covs immune focusing may also be beneficial for the generation of a robust virus-specific immune response as during vaccine preparation some epitopes which are normally hidden in the full length protein structure get exposed some epitopes could be immunodominant and have a negative contribution on the overall neutralization capacity produced by the vaccine 76 this also holds true for some non-neutralizing immunodominant epitopes as s1-based vaccines induced slightly higher neutralization than whole s ectodomain-based ones 58 53 additionally the rbd induced higher neutralizing antibodies compared to an s1 subunit vaccine 48 and shorter regions of rbd induced even higher neutralization responses 66 indicating that additional regions inducing non-neutralizing antibodies may contribute negatively to the overall neutralization response produced additionally antibody-dependent enhancement of the viral infection by non-neutralizing antibodies 77 78 79 despite not being reported so far for mers-cov needs also to be taken into consideration when developing a coronavirus vaccine one approach to enhance the efficacy of subunit vaccines is to mask those negatively-contributing epitopes through glycosylation 76 other approaches are immunefocusing and epitope-based vaccines all aiming at narrowing the immune response to target only critical or beneficial epitopes to produce a stronger protective response a prerequisite to reach that goal is to map epitopes targeted by the immune system and identify their biological role as being neutralizing non-neutralizing infection enhancing containing a t-cell epitope and so on this can be achieved by analyzing the activity and fine specificity of convalescent patient sera infected animal polyclonal sera monoclonal antibodies animal and human pbmcs subsequently the predicted epitopes can also provide a basis for potential vaccine candidates when produced as nanoparticles or vlps further characterization of the immune responses induced by these vaccine candidates when evaluated in an animal model may be utilized to optimize the vaccines for efficacy figure 1
 this epitope-focused vaccine approach may allow for targeting less immunodominant b- and t-cell epitopes having broader protection avoid eliciting immune responses against epitopes playing no role in protection or having a negative or harmful role in addition to better targeting of protective immunodominant epitopes a combination of those epitopes b- and t-cell epitopes targeting different viral proteins could be used to produce a broader and stronger protective immune response for both strain-specific and universal cov vaccines next to the choice of the mers-cov vaccine candidate it is also important to take into account the target population that needs to be protected through vaccination populations at risk of mers-cov infection include camel contacts healthcare workers and patient contacts the latter two groups could benefit from the rapid onset of immunity though passive immunization using mabs or convalescent sera provided that it is given in time another alternative strategy for short-term protection is the use of vaccines capable of rapidly inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies this will provide a short-term immunity beneficial to protect those highly-at-risk groups when a new case is identified to prevent outbreaks to prevent virus infection of primary cases vaccination of the dromedary camels may also be considered so far among the available vaccine candidates only two have been tested in dromedary camels pvax1-s and mva-s pvax1-s a dna-based vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies in two of three camels tested so far but has not been tested for efficacy 59 the other candidate mva-s a viral-vector-based vaccine induced systemic neutralizing antibodies and mucosal immunity which conferred protection against mers-cov challenge and reduced virus shedding in vaccinated camels 52 therefore this vaccine candidate may provide a means to prevent zoonotic transmission of the virus to the human population for camel contacts and healthcare workers in endemic areas being at a continuous risk of mers-cov infection either from infected camels or patients respectively it would be beneficial to induce a longer-term mucosal protection while these could be rewarding approaches to stop mers-cov outbreaks it is still worthwhile to develop platforms and vaccines that aim to induce more broad protection against different related covs that could potentially cause future outbreaks learning from previous epidemics the who issued a list of priority pathogens posing a risk to the human population and requiring urgent research and development rd for intervention measures among which mers-cov and highly pathogenic covs are of high priority the lack of intervention measures along with the increase in geographical area and ongoing mers-cov cases raise worries for the future occurrence of larger epidemics as a result of virus adaptation in the human population and more efficient human-to human transmission further development of mers-cov and other cov vaccines thus needs proactive collaborative efforts from researchers filling knowledge gaps and market stakeholders providing funding for this costly process the latter can be insufficient andor unsustainable therefore hindering development of even some promising candidates in an initiative aiming at accelerating vaccine rd process by providing sustained funding to be prepared for future epidemics the world economic forum launched the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi 80 cepi is an international non-profit association aiming at removing barriers facing vaccine development for epidemic infections and getting ready for future epidemics including mers-cov however we still face a number of challenges despite the fact that various promising mers-cov vaccine candidates are currently available there is a lack of animal models mimicking the disease in humans in which vaccine platforms can be tested prior to human use we need to take into account the populations to target with vaccination with camels and camel handlers being the most relevant ones the lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses to the virus in humans and camels which is crucial for vaccine development also needs further investments in addition the longevity of immune responses post-vaccination has not been evaluated for vaccine candidates which is important for the vaccination scheme development and for the choice of the best candidates for further development lastly most of the vaccine candidates are developed against the highly variable spike protein and thus may not be able to provide protection against cov strains evolving in the future a more targeted vaccination approach aiming at conserved epitopes should be considered for the development of a more broadly-acting cov vaccine given the propensity of covs to jump the species barrier current efforts to develop a mers-cov vaccine may also be of benefit to prepare for potential novel covs that may emerge in the future papers of particular interest published within the period of review have been highlighted as of special interest of outstanding interest
  a candidate multi-epitope vaccine against sars-cov-2 tamalika kar utkarsh narsaria srijita basak debashrito deb filippo castiglione david mueller m anurag srivastava p   wuhan a city in china witnessed the outbreak of a febrile respiratory illness on 19th december 2019 due to the coronavirus provisionally named as 2019-ncov and later sars-cov-212 the disease caused by this coronavirus was named as covid-1912 since then the world is experiencing a grave situation of global public health emergency due to the viral pandemic of severe febrile pneumonia like respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus2 coronaviruses are known to have caused three epidemics in the last two decades namely covid-19 in 201920 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 20123 as of june 3rd 2020 total cases of sars-cov-2 confirmed globally by world health organization are 6287771 with 379941 reported deaths httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports human coronavirus h-cov is a member of coronaviridae family a virus family characterized with the largest rna genome 2632 kb among all of the viruses known till date46 a lipid envelope bilayer containing the spike and membrane proteins surround the positive stranded rna genome of this virus7 the spike protein binds to the host cell receptors and releases the viral genome into the host cell thereby facilitating the viral replication8 coronaviruses covs are mostly associated with respiratory illness and common cold9 but can also cause infections in central nervous system cns10 to date four genera of coronaviruses     have been identified11 human coronaviruses h-covs belong to  hcov-229e and nl63 and  mers-cov sars-cov hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 and sars-cov-2 genera of coronavirus respectively11 in late december 2019 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards along with cough fever and dyspnoea due to an unknown microbial infection were recorded in wuhan china12 viral genome sequencing of five pneumonia patients hospitalized between 18th december and 29th december 2019 reported the presence of a previously unknown -cov strain in all of the 5 hospitalized patients12 there was around 88 sequence similarity between the novel -cov strain and two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndromes sars-like coronaviruses namely bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 while mers-cov displayed a sequence identity of about 50 with the novel -cov12 coronavirus infection in humans is primarily guided by interactions between envelope anchored spike glycoprotein s-protein of cov and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 of the host cell receptor1314 the viral rna genome is released into the cytoplasm once the virus enters the cells and is then translated into two polyproteins and structural proteins after which the viral genome starts to replicate11 the s protein is composed of two subunits one subunit s1 is the receptor binding domain rbd and the other subunit s2 is responsible for the fusion of viral membrane and the host cellular membrane15 an overall 75 sequence similarity was seen between sars-cov-2 and previously identified sars-cov spike protein1617 in addition it is also reported that the coronavirus s protein is a major determinant of virus entry into host cells3 hence the spike like glycoprotein is a potent choice for vaccine designing the vaccine candidate once introduced into the body is detected by the host innate immune system by using pattern recognition receptors prrs to identify the pathogenassociated molecular patterns pamps the pathogen-associated patterns contained in vaccine antigens attract dendritic cells monocytes and neutrophils that patrol throughout the body18 through the pattern-recognition receptors among which the toll-like receptors play an important role the host cells sense the potential danger when they detect a pathogen and become activated18 elicitation of sufficient danger signals by the vaccine antigens or adjuvants activate monocytes and dendritic cells they modulate their surface molecules expression and develop pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines resulting in the extravasation and attraction of monocytes granulocytes and natural killer cells this leads to the generation of an inflammatory microenvironment where the monocytes differentiate into macrophages and immature dendritic cells are activated19 this activation alters the expression of the homing receptors at the cell surface and triggers the migration of dendritic cells towards the lymph nodes where the activation of t and b lymphocyte takes place on contact with nave t cells the t cells differentiate into regulatory cd4 cells that maintain immune tolerance20 the immature dendritic cells recognize the protein vaccine antigen and then migrate towards the lymph node during this migration the dendritic cells mature and their surface expression of molecules changes21 simultaneously processing of antigens into smaller fragments occur which is then displayed at the cell surface in the grooves of mhc human leukocyte antigen hla in humans molecules the peptides from the antigens that are produced in the cytosol of infected cells are presented by mhc class i molecules and phagocytised antigens are essentially displayed on mhc class ii molecules2225 the antigenic peptides displayed by class ii mhc molecules are recognized by cd4 t cells whereas cd8 t cells bind to class i mhc-peptide complexes26 activated cd4 t cells secrete cytokines and are responsible for the further activation of b cells required for proper antibody generation27 fig 1
 the conventional method of vaccine designing involving entire organisms or large proteins lead to unnecessary antigenic load along with increased chances of allergenic responses28 this problem can be overcome by peptide based vaccines comprising short immunogenic peptide fragments with the ability to elicit strong and targeted immune responses avoiding the chances of allergenic reactions28 recent advancements in computational biology have opened up new doors for designing effective vaccines in silico2931 in this study the in silico approach has been applied for attaining a multi-epitope vaccine against sars-cov-2 that comprises of spike glycoprotein epitopes which induces the activation of cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls helper t lymphocytes htls and interferon- ifn- fig 2 the spike glycoprotein sequence of sars-cov-2 was retrieved from pdb 6vsb phylogenetic analysis of the sars-cov-2 glycoprotein was performed in order to check the evolutionary relationship of sars-cov-2 with other coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-0c43 hku-1 mers-cov sars-cov fig 3 the analysis revealed that the glycoprotein variants of sars-cov-2 clustered together in a single clade having the most common ancestry with sars-cov and mers-cov fig 3 the variants of sars-cov-2 that clustered together had very less branching indicating minimum variations hence the vaccine designed against one strain can be used for all the other strains of sars-cov-2 similarly the phylogenetic analysis of different sars-cov-2 strains isolated from different countries was conducted to determine if a single vaccine can be used against all the different strains of the virus isolated from various parts of the world supplementary fig s1 the results indicated that all the glycoproteins of different strains of sars-cov-2 isolated from different countries were closely related to one another suggesting that a vaccine designed against one strain would be effective against all the other strains of viruses isolated from different countries supplementary fig s1
 an ideal prophylactic vaccine should mimic the natural immunity induced by an infection with the generation of a long-lasting adaptive immunity where both ctl and htl epitopes play an important role32 the ctl epitopes are responsible for developing long lasting cellular immunity which has the ability to eliminate the circulating virus and the virus infected cells33 on the other hand htl epitopes play a crucial role in generating both humoral and cellular immune responses these epitopes elicit a cd4 helper response which is not only necessary for the development of protective cd8 t-cell memory but also activation of b-cells for antibody generation3435 therefore an effective vaccine candidate should consist of the important ctl and htl receptor specific epitopes in this study ctl epitopes were predicted using netctl12 and iedb consensus methods whereas htl epitopes were predicted using netmhc ii pan 32 server as shown in tables 1 and 2 supplementary table s1 s2 in order to identify the best epitopes the predicted epitopes were subjected to various immune filters and those having high binding affinity to mhc class i and class ii alleles were selected the criteria for screening out the epitopes were they should be promiscuous should be antigenic and should be immunogenic the antigenicity of the epitopes was predicted using vaxijen v20 and immunogenicity was predicted using iedb class i immunogenicity server the 3d structure of spike glycoprotein was modelled using i-tasser and the epitopes considered for vaccine construction were visualized on the same fig 4


 the main criteria used for designing the linear vaccine construct were 1 it should contain overlapping htl and ctl epitopes supplementary table s3 2 it must be immunogenic antigenic but not an allergen 3 it should have high affinity to hla alleles and should be promiscuous on basis of these parameters a linear vaccine was constructed including 7 ctl 8 htl and 3 ifn- tables 1 2 supplementary table s4 epitopes joined by gpgpg linkers which prevent the formation of junctional epitopes and also facilitate the immune processing of antigen68 cholera toxin b ctb adjuvant was attached to the n-terminal of the construct via eaaak linker fig 5a in order to boost a long lasting immune response the final vaccine construct consisted of 422 amino acids with a molecular weight of 4415 kda the 3d models of the vaccine were generated using trrosetta server in order to validate the structural quality of the predicted model ramachandran plot z-score and errat analyses were performed amongst the predicted models the best model was chosen fig 5b that had a z-score of  81 which was within the range of scores of comparable size proteins indicating the reliability of the predicted model36 fig 5d the modelled structure was evaluated using rampage and was used for the generation of ramachandran plot the ramachandran plot analysis of the 3d-model of the vaccine showed that 964 residues lied in favoured region 29 residues in allowed and 07 residues in outlier regions respectively which verifies the overall quality of the vaccine construct fig 5e ideally for a model to be reliable at least 90 of its residues should lie in the favoured region37 the total number of residues present in the favoured region for our 3d model was within the range of the ideal value more than 90 which confirms its reliability the errat score revealed after errat analysis was 742947 representing the percentage of the protein falling below the rejection limit of 9538 fig 5c generally an errat score greater than 50 represents a good quality model39 and so the score 742947 further validates our modelled structure
 immunogenicity is the ability to induce humoral and cellular immune responses while antigenicity is the ability to recognize a specific antigen accompanied by an immune response therefore the vaccine candidate should be antigenic as well as immunogenic in nature40 the multi-epitope vaccine construct was found to be immunogenic as predicted by iedb class i immunogenicity tool with a score of 665414 and as per the instruction of iedb higher score indicates a greater probability of eliciting an immune response vaxijen v20 confirmed the antigenicity of the vaccine with a score of 05107 a score  04 is considered to be antigenic allergenicity was checked in order to ensure that the candidate vaccine does not stimulate any allergic reactions once introduced into the body the vaccine candidate was found to be non-allergen as predicted by allertop and allergenfp web servers evaluation of various physicochemical properties is essential for determining the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine41 hence various chemical and physical parameters associated with the vaccine were predicted in this study using expasy supplementary material 1 the theoretical pi of the vaccine was found to be 996 the aliphatic index of the vaccine is 7874 which suggest the vaccine to be of thermostable nature higher the aliphatic index of a protein greater is its thermostability89 the estimated half-life of the vaccine as predicted by expasy is 30 h in mammalian reticulocytes  20 h in yeast and  10 h in escherichia coli the grand average hydropathicity gravy score is  0088 lower the gravy score better is the solubility which indicates the candidate vaccine is of hydrophilic nature meaning it can perform interaction with aqueous environment the instability index of vaccine candidate was found to be 3104 indicating stable nature of the protein generally a protein whose instability index is  40 is classified as a stable protein89 since the designed vaccine does not contain any transmembrane helices no expression difficulties are to be anticipated in the production of vaccine supplementary fig s3 also the absence of signal peptides in the vaccine construct signifies prevention of protein localization supplementary fig s2 b cell epitopes have the ability to elicit humoral immunity as they are recognized by the b-cell receptors or secreted antibodies42 the presence of these epitopes in the designed vaccine play an important role in triggering efficient immune response therefore in this study the linearcontinuous and conformationaldiscontinuous b cell epitopes were predicted by the ellipro server using default parameters tables 3 4 the visualisation of b cell epitopes in the final vaccine construct was done using pymol the pymol molecular graphics system version 20 schrdinger llc supplementary fig s4

 the distribution and expression of hla alleles may vary across the world based on the difference between regions and ethnicities43 in addition successful vaccine development demands the assessment of hla allele distribution around the world population44 therefore this study was conducted in order to evaluate if the vaccine designed against sars-cov-2 will be effective for the world population the selected epitopes in our study showed total world population coverage of 9578 table 5 in addition the epitopes showed 9747 9726 8484 8766 and 9077 coverage in europe united states china south asia and oceania respectively table 5 supplementary fig s5 the results suggest that the designed multi-epitope vaccine can be used to tackle sars-cov-2 globally
 in order to generate a stable immune response it is important for the vaccine to interact with target immune cell receptors for studying such interactions molecular docking studies were performed with toll-like receptors toll-like receptors tlrs have a central role in innate immunity as they detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps on a range of microbes including viruses leading to innate immune activation and orchestration of the adaptive immune response45 tlr4 and tlr2 have also been implicated in the recognition of viral structural proteins leading to inflammatory cytokine production46 in addition several studies on sars-cov have shown the importance of tlr4 and tlr2 in generation of an effective immune response4749 therefore molecular docking studies of the vaccine candidate with tlr4tlr2 were conducted haddock clustered 33 structures in 7 clusters which represents 165 of the water refined haddock generated models the top cluster with the lowest haddock score is the most reliable cluster of all a representative model of the top cluster was subjected to further refinement using haddock refinement server where 20 structures were clustered into one cluster resulting in 100 of the water refined models generated by haddock the statistics of the refined model are presented in the table 6 and the structural analysis of the refined model is shown in supplementary fig s7 the haddock score of  1309  101 suggest a good binding affinity between the vaccine and the receptor negative score indicates better docking a buried surface area bsa of 22044  224 2 indicates close proximity and a less water-exposed protein surface50 in addition rmsd scores are also considered as an important parameter for evaluation of efficient docking studies as it allows us to identify the complex with the lowest energy and least structural deviation the low rmsd score of the docked complex table 6 indicates a good quality model the predicted interaction of the amino acids and a detailed overview of the molecular docking are given in supplementary material 2 and supplementary fig s8 respectively also ramachandran plot analysis was carried out for structural validation of the docked complex supplementary fig s6 the docked complex along with some prominent hydrogen bonds is shown in fig 6

 the binding affinity of a complex or the gibbs free energy g in terms of thermodynamics is a crucial quantity for determining whether an interaction will actually occur or not in the cell at specific conditions52 therefore the binding affinity of the 4 docked complexes was analysed using prodigy web server the g values for the vaccine-tlr4 vaccine-tlr2 vaccine-mhc class i and vaccine-mhc class ii receptor was found to be  103 kcal mol1  112 kcal mol1  135 kcal mol1  160 kcal mol1 respectively table 10 the results revealed that all of the 4 dockings were energetically feasible as indicated by the negative values of gibbs free energy g the dissociation constant kd of the docked complexes are shown in table 10
 molecular dynamics simulation mds is essential to determine the stability of a protein at different thermobaric conditions in order to check the protein stability energy minimization for the vaccine was conducted using the steepest descent algorithm of gromacs once the force reaches  1000 kjmol the protein is considered to be energy minimised the energy minimisation for the vaccine construct was conducted for 2262 steps where the force reached  1000 kjmol the potential energy of the system was computed to be  30e  06 kjmol with a total drift of  38  105 kjmol and the average potential energy was  29e  06 kjmol after 50000 steps of nvt the average temperature was 2998 k with a drift of 10 k fig 10d the average density of the system computed was 10125 kgm3 with a total drift of 13 kgm3 fig 10b the pressure of the system was found to be 16 bar with a total drift of 42 bar fig 10c trajectory analysis was performed after a simulation period of 10 ns in order to check the stability and flexibility of the vaccine candidate the plot for the radius of gyration showed the compactness of the protein around its axes fig 10a a plot of rmsd backbone revealed very mild fluctuations indicating the stability of the vaccine over time fig 10e the high peaks in the rmsf plot suggested a high degree of flexibility in the vaccine construct fig 10f
 in silico cloning was performed so that the vaccine candidate could be expressed into the e coli expression system therefore it was necessary to optimize the codon respective to the vaccine construct as per the usage of e coli expression system in order to ensure efficient translation and increased protein production for optimizing the codon usage of the designed vaccine construct for maximal protein expression in e coli k-12 strain jcat tool was used the generated cdna sequence after codon optimization was 1266 nucleotides long supplementary material sm6 generally a codon adaptation index cai value  08 and the gc content between 30 and 70 are considered for a good protein expression in the host system our vaccine had a codon adaptation index cai of 10 and gc content of the reverse translated vaccine was 5853 these results support a proficient expression of the designed vaccine in e coli k-12 strain finally the recombinant plasmid was designed by inserting the adapted codon sequences into pet-28a  vector using snapgene software computationally fig 11 this study was conducted in order to design an effective cloning strategy for the candidate vaccine an in silico immune response was generated using the c-immsim immune server in order to assess the immunogenic profile of multi-epitope vaccine53 fig 12 the secondary and tertiary responses generated by the simulation were significantly higher when compared to the primary response the secondary and tertiary responses revealed a decrease in the antigenic concentration with normal high levels of immunoglobulin activity ie igg1  igg2 igm and igg  igm antibodies in addition multiple long lasting b cell isotypes were found suggesting possible isotype switching potentials and memory formation fig 12aii supplementary fig s18 the th helper and tc cytotoxic cell populations also showed a similar higher response with the pre activation of tcs during vaccination fig 12aiv aiii supplementary fig s18 the nk natural killer and dendritic cell activity was found to be consistent along with higher macrophage activity supplementary fig s18 demonstrated during the exposure fig 12av the generation of a good immune response was supported by the high levels of ifn- and il-2 elicited in the simulation after the vaccination an injection of a live-replicating virus was simulated at around day 366 in order to check the efficacy of the vaccine the antigen graph fig 12ai shows that after the vaccination when a live replicating virus is injected the antigenic surge is virtually absent indicating an effective immune response mainly due to the protective action of high concentration of specific antibodies this outcome should be compared with a control simulation that was also performed consisting of an injection of the live virus after 1 year without prior vaccination in this case results indicate that without prior vaccination the host is unable to contain the antigen though an inefficacious immune response is generated fig 12b supplementary fig s19 in another control experiment a vaccine construct was designed utilizing randomly generated sequences to see its effect on immune response as expected the immune simulation results obtained from the randomly generated sequence shows the absence of any immune response thereby confirming the failure of vaccination data not shown the simple reason for this is the lack of antigenic peptides in the random sequence which in the simulation translates in the absence of antigenic presentation by professional antigen presenting cells sars-cov-2 has been declared as a global pandemic by world health organization affecting people of all age groups world health organizations announcement on covid-19 as a global public health emergency has encouraged researchers to develop therapeutics such as drug candidates and vaccines against the disease54 the cost effective and time saving immunoinformatic approaches have already helped the researchers to predict potential antigenic epitopes required for the development of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate5558 the distinctive concept of multi-epitope vaccine design as compared to classical single-epitope based vaccine is that the screening of viral genome to identify immunogenic epitopes results in the elicitation of a highly targeted immune response without any reversal of viral pathogenesis59 in this study we aim at designing a multi-epitope prophylactic vaccine targeting the spike protein of sars-cov-2 which is one of the major determinants of antigenicity and viral entry into the host cell3 several computational tools were used to construct a multi-epitope vaccine which has the ability to generate both humoral and cell mediated immunity the multi-epitope vaccine elicits immune responses based on short immunogenic sequences instead of large proteins or whole genome which is typically used for recombinant vaccine technology thus this approach avoids the excess antigenic load as well as allergenic responses in the host286061 the analysis of the entire spectrum of possible antigens can be carried out using immunoinformatics and molecular modelling in order to examine the potential binding with host proteins556265 in addition these multi-epitope vaccines have advantages over traditional and single-epitope vaccines due to the following unique features i multiple mhc class i and class ii epitopes can be recognized by tcrs from various t cell subsets ii overlapping ctl htl and b cell epitopes have the capacity to activate humoral and cellular immune responses simultaneously iii linking an adjuvant to the vaccine ensures a long lasting immune response with enhanced immunogenicity iv the in vitro antigen expression complications as well as the difficulty of culturing the pathogens can also be avoided6674 designing of multi-epitope vaccines is an emerging area which has already gained importance and the vaccines designed by this approach have not only shown in vivo efficacy with protective immunity7577 but also entered phase-i clinical trials70 717879 the present study utilized the potential immunogenic epitopes identified from the sars-cov-2 spike protein to construct the multi-epitope vaccine with cholera toxin b ctb as an adjuvant along with appropriate linkers cholera toxin b which has been proven to act as a potential viral adjuvant is linked at the n-terminal of the vaccine construct8082 glycine rich linker such as gpgpg was preferred to link the screened epitopes as it enhances the solubility and enable the adjoining domains to be accessible and act freely83 various immunological filters were used to screen the predicted ctl and htl epitopes the epitopes must be antigenic and immunogenic should bind with multiple mhc class i and mhc class ii alleles promiscuous and must have overlapping ctl and htl epitopes a similar approach was used by bazhan and his co-workers where they have designed a t-cell multi epitope vaccine against ebola virus the t-cell epitopes were predicted using iedbimmune epitope database and the vaccine candidate constructed using the suitable epitopes were found to be immunogenic when expressed in mice84 our designed vaccine was predicted to be non-allergen using allertop v20 server which was further verified by allergenfp v108588 the other physicochemical properties of the vaccine were analysed using protparam tool offered by expasy server89 the molecular weight of the construct was 4415 kda and the instability index was evaluated to be 3104 which classify the vaccine to be stable generally a protein whose instability index is lesser than 40 is predicted to be stable and values above that predicts the protein as unstable89 the theoretical pi of the vaccine was calculated to be 996 the gravy index of the vaccine was  0088 lower the gravy score better is the solubility which is reflective of the vaccines polar nature and its effective interaction with water suggesting high solubility90 the aliphatic index of 7874 indicated the protein to be thermostable91 the half-life of the vaccine was evaluated to be 30 h mammalian reticulocytes in vitro  20 h yeast in vivo and  10 h escherichia coli in vivo which indicates the time taken by the protein to reach 50 of its concentration after its synthesis in the cell similarly foroutan and his colleagues have also used the same array of in silico analysis in order to assess the allergenecity and physicochemical properties of their designed vaccine candidate against toxoplasma gondii92 they have also performed laboratory validation of their vaccine candidate which revealed that the multi-epitope vaccine was able to trigger strong humoral and cellular responses in mice92 the physicochemical properties predicted in our study were comparable to those predicted by foroutan et al in their recently published work92 in fact the instability index and aliphatic index of our vaccine candidate was found to be better when compared to the values reported by foroutan et al92 the structural validation of our vaccine construct performed by ramachandran plot analysis using rampage showed that 964 of residues were in favoured region 29 were in the allowed region and only 04 of the residues were placed in the outlier region thereby validating the tertiary structure of the vaccine the errat score of 7429 further validated the overall quality of our vaccine and z-score assessment by prosa web server revealed a score of  81 indicating that the protein falls in the plot which consists of the z-scores of the already determined structures solved by nmr and x-ray crystallographic experiments36 the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 which is one of the structural components of the virus should be recognized by the toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 and toll-like receptor 2 tlr2 expressed in the plasma membrane of the cells459394 human toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 is expressed in various types of immune cells like monocytes macrophages granulocytes and immature dendritic cells95 a direct interaction between tlr4 and ctb is responsible for the activation of tlr4 by ctb96 this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the capacity of ctb to induce inflammatory response is lost in tlr4-deficient macrophages96 the elisa-based assays have demonstrated that ctb is able to induce nf-b activation in tlr4 receptor cells by binding to it directly96 in addition tlr2 is also associated with recognition of viral envelop glycoprotein93 the myeloid differentiation factor 88 myd88 acts as the primary adaptor for the core tlr2 signalling pathway which results in nf-b and mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk activation leading to secretion of a core panel of cytokines93 the interaction pattern of the vaccine with tlr4 and tlr2 was analysed by molecular docking studies figs 6 7 the docking analysis of tlr4 and the vaccine construct showed that there are 3 salt bridges and 7 hydrogen bonds formed during this interaction the docked complex shows that the salt bridges were formed between arg41 glu68 asp69 of tlr4 and asp113 lys85 lys82 of vaccine respectively similarly docking analysis of tlr2 and the vaccine construct also showed that there are 3 salt bridges and 9 hydrogen bonds formed during the interaction the salt bridges formed in this case were between asp516 asp520 arg547 of tlr4 and lys85 lys82 glu105 of our vaccine respectively several studies on sars-cov have shown the importance of tlr4 and tlr2 in generation of an effective immune response in one of the studies totura et al has demonstrated that tlr4 deficient mice are more susceptible to sars-cov infection than the wild type mice47 similarly hu et al conducted a study where they have seen the expression and regulation of toll-like receptors in human monocytic cell upon sars-cov infection48 the results obtained from their study indicate that the expression of tlr4tlr2 is upregulated at 24 h after sars-cov infection suggesting its importance in the generation of immune responses48 in addition dosch et al have shown that tlr2 present on human macrophages interacts with s protein of sars-cov to induce il-8 production in body49 the sensitized tlr2 triggers the release of il-8 which is an important chemokine necessary for generating an innate immune response49 the molecular dynamics simulation of the vaccine construct for 10 ns showed that there were very mild fluctuations in the rmsd graph indicating the vaccines stability fig 10 the rmsf graph showed regions with high peaks indicating the high flexibility of the vaccine construct fig 10 the molecular dynamics simulation mds is one of the most important steps used to check the stability of the vaccine by simulating the vaccine under in vivo conditions rmsd and rmsf data obtained from our mds is similar to the studies done by other research groups where they have checked the stability and flexibility of the vaccine candidate mimicking the in vivo conditions288788 to assure an effective expression in e coli host codon optimization of the designed vaccine was performed and the linear vaccine construct was reverse translated into its specific cdna sequence the gc content of it was recorded as 5853 therefore showing the possibility of efficient expression of the vaccine candidate in e coli host further insertion of the vaccine in the expression vector pet-28a  for in silico cloning was performed so that the vaccine can be expressed in bacterial system a similar approach was used by foroutan et al in order to optimize the codon of their designed vaccine before its in vitro expression92 the immune simulation studies confirmed that our designed vaccine was able to elicit specific immune responses required to clear the antigen on secondary exposure fig 12 after the final injection our immune simulation study was in fact better than the recently published work on multi-epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 where there was no live replicating virus injected after the vaccination in order to check its effectiveness on a secondary exposure with the antigen97 similarly the immunoinformatic strategy of vaccine designing has recently been applied for designing multi-epitope vaccines against pseudomonas aeruginosa98 klebsiella pneumoniae88 dengue99 nipah virus100 hendra virus101 and malaria102 in addition similar approach has also been applied for developing vaccine against cancerous antigens28103 the ctl htl and ifn- epitopes included in the vaccine has the capacity to trigger the stimulation of hosts respective immune cells which in turn can cause the activation of other immune cells via complex signalling the vipr database httpswwwviprbrcorgbrchomespgdecoratorvipr was used to retrieve the spike glycoprotein sequences of 7 coronaviruses hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-0c43 hku-1 mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which have previously infected the human population in addition spike glycoprotein sequences of different strains of sars-cov-2 isolated from 19 different countries china japan usa australia finland sweden india colombia taiwan pakistan italy israel iran iran vietnam peru brazil spain nepal and south korea around the globe were also retrieved from the vipr database two phylogeny trees were constructed and for both the trees the muscle tool104 was used in order to align the glycoprotein sequences and the alignment file was used to construct the phylogenetic trees with default parameters and 1000 bootstrap replicates using the neighbour joining algorithm of mega 7014105 9-mer long ctl epitopes were predicted using netctl 12 server httpswwwcbsdtudkservicesnetctl recognized by the hla class i supertypes which are commonly occurring in human population ie a1 a2 a3 a24 a26 b7 b8 b27 b39 b44 b58 and b62106 in the netctl 12 server the thresholds were set at 015 005 and 075 for distinctive parameters such as proteasomal c-terminal cleavage transporter associated with antigen processing tap and epitope recognition respectively netctl supports epitope prediction with 5489 sensitivity and 9499 specificity also the epitopes recognized by other hla class i alleles were detected by immune epitope consensus iedb tool httpstoolsiedborgmhci107 15-mer long htl epitopes were predicted using netmhcii pan 32 server wwwcbsdtudkservicesnetmhciipan which had an affinity to class ii hla alleles108 the predicted peptides were classified as strong intermediate and non-binders with threshold value set at 2 10 and  10 respectively based on the idea of percentile rank as given by netmhcii pan 32 server the epitopes were screened on the basis of antigenicity as well as immunogenicity as predicted by vaxijen v20 and iedb class i immunogenicity web servers respectively109110 the 3d structure of the spike glycoprotein was modelled using i-tasser in order to visualize the selected epitopes on the protein surface111113 for both humoral and innate immunity ifn- plays important role in antiviral anti-tumour and immune regulatory activities hence ifn- inducing epitopes are important for designing a potential multi-epitope vaccine from the target protein ifnepitope server httpscrddosddnetraghavaifnepitope was used to predict out the ifn- epitopes115 the server has a maximum accuracy of 8139 and various approaches such as machine learning strategy motive-based analysis and accuracy hybrid approach is used for the prediction of the epitopes the iedb population coverage analysis tool httpstoolsiedborgpopulation was used in order to check if the epitopes of the designed vaccine had effectively covered the entire world population44 as sars-cov-2 is a global pandemic the population coverage was checked for the total world population united states europe china south asia and oceania the default parameters were used and the coverage was checked against the hla class i and hla class ii binding alleles the screened ctl htl and ifn- inducing epitopes from the target glycoprotein were together linked by glycine-proline rich gpgpg linkers in addition cholera toxin b ctb adjuvant was added by eaaak linker to the n-terminal of the vaccine construct as it can induce regulatory immune responses trrosetta was used to generate the 3d model of linear vaccine construct116 the tertiary structure was validated using errat score38 followed by prosa-web analysis36 prosa-web validates the structure based on z-score predicted further the overall quality of the generated model of vaccine was determined by ramachandran plot analysis using rampage server117 vaxijen v20109 was used to check the antigenicity of the vaccine construct with a threshold value of 04 viral databases were used to extract whole-protein antigenicity prediction models each set was made up of 100 identified antigens and 100 non-antigens the generated models were evaluated using data sets utilizing internal leave-one-out cross-validation and external validation the models implemented in the server worked well in both validations showing 70 to 89 predictive accuracy also the allergenicity of the vaccine was checked using allertop server85 this server employs auto-cross-covariance acc grouping of protein sequences into uniform equal-length vectors this has been applied to peptide study with the various types with quantitative structureactivity relationships qsar the k-nearest neighbour algorithm knn k  1 is used by the server to identify proteins based on a training set composed of 2427 identified allergens and 2427 non-allergens of various species in addition the allergenicity of the designed vaccine was cross checked by allergenfp server httpsddg-pharmfacnetallergenfp86 other physicochemical properties like isoelectric point molecular weight instability index aliphatic index half-life and gravy score of the vaccine was assessed using expasy protparam server89 the vaccine construct was also checked for the presence of any signal peptides and transmembrane helices by signalp41 httpswwwcbsdtudkservicessignalp118 and tmhmm server v20 httpswwwcbsdtudkservicestmhmm119  respectively for generation of a stable immune response it is essential for the vaccine to interact with target immune cell receptors to study such interactions molecular docking studies are performed in this study interactions of the vaccine with tlr4 dimer and tlr2 are studied as they localize on cell surface thereby inducing immune response when activated by the vaccine120121 in addition the vaccine was also docked with mhc class i and mhc class ii receptors tlr4 hetero-tetramer structure and tlr2 structure were obtained from protein data bank id 3fxi and id 2z7x respectively whereas the mhc class i and mhc class ii receptors were obtained from pdb id 1i1y and 1kg0 respectively cport122 was utilized for predicting the active and passive residues for the interactions the docking of the vaccine with tlr4 tlr2 mhc class i and mhc class ii receptors were performed by haddock 24 httpswwwbonvinlaborgsoftwarehaddock24123 the best cluster was chosen from the docked clusters based on lowest haddock score haddock refinement interface was used to refine the chosen cluster the best structure after refinement from each docked complex were chosen and their binding affinity was calculated using prodigy web server124125 finally the interacting residues between the vaccine and the tlrs were mapped using pdbsum httpswwwebiacukthornton-srvdatabasespdbsumgeneratehtml126 gromacs groningen machine for chemical simulations a linux-based program was used for the molecular dynamics simulation mds and energy minimisation127 mds was done for the vaccine structure in order to see how it behaves in the in vivo biological system opls-aa optimized potential for liquid simulation-all atom force field constrain was used to generate the topology file required for energy minimization and equilibration an equilibrated three-point water model spc216 was used as the solvent to simulate the vaccine with periodic boundary conditions the net charge of the vaccine construct was evaluated and charged ions were added in order to neutralize the system the simulation run was performed for 10 ns of the energy minimised structure in order to find the root mean square deviation rmsd of backbone and root mean square fluctuation rmsf of side chain the graphs were visualized using xmgrace plotting tool128 the java codon adaptation tool jcat httpswwwjcatde was used for codon optimization and reverse translation which generated the cdna sequence of the vaccine that can be used for an efficient expression in e coli k-12 strain129 the result consists of gc content and codon adaptation index cai score that can be used to assess protein expression levels in addition the optimized multi-epitope vaccine sequence was inserted into the pet-28a  vector by snapgene tool c-immsim server httpskrakeniacrmcnritc-immsim was used for performing the immune simulation of the vaccine in order to characterize the immune response profile and immunogenicity of the chimeric peptides53 c-immsim is an agent-based model that uses position-specific scoring matrices pssm for peptide prediction derived from machine learning techniques for predicting immune interactions the minimum recommended time between dose 1 and dose 2 for most of the vaccines currently in use is 4 weeks130 the entire simulation ran for 1400 time steps which are about 15 months a time step is about 8 h two peptide injections were given four weeks apart at time step 10 94 178 262 346 430 514 598 682 766 850 934 then a live virus was injected at time step 1100 which is about 12 months after the simulation starts the current global pandemic of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 is to date un-controllable with high death rate no proper medical preventives like vaccines are given to the patients yet for recovery application of in silico methods can be used to design an effective vaccine in lesser time and low cost in this study immunoinformatic tools are used for constructing a multi-epitope vaccine against sars-cov-2 consisting of ctl htl and ifn- epitopes that can trigger strong immune responses the designed multi-epitope vaccine was found to be both antigenic and immunogenic the stability of the designed vaccine was assured by molecular dynamics simulation and a stable interaction of the vaccine with immune receptors was confirmed by molecular docking studies further in silico expression studies confirmed the vaccines expression in bacterial host and the efficiency of the vaccine to trigger an immune response was validated by immune simulation studies  covid-19 vaccines a race against

financially supported by dr khuroos medical trust a non-profit organization that supports academic activities and helps poor and needy for treatment the coronavirus infection which originated from wuhan china in december 2019 has turned in to a global catastrophe 1 the virus has been designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 and the disease caused by the agent as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 2 world health organization who pronounced the disease as a pandemic on march 11 2020 3 as of may 4th 2020 the infection has spread to 212 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances with over 35 million cases and around two hundred fifty-thousand deaths 4 the disease on average affects over 33000 individuals with over 1300 deaths daily the world community has responded to the challenge of death and devastation with resilience and determination 5 governments have implemented lockdown measures blocked international travel and enforced other public containment measures to mitigate the virus morbidity and mortality 6 7 8 there has been a major understanding of the disease as well as the pathogen and these data have been generated and widely publicized in a matter of days and weeks rather than years and decades an unprecedented occurrence in the history of medicine 9 10 11 12 sars-cov-2 belongs to a family of zoonotic viruses known as coronavirus genus betacononavirus and is closely related to two other viruses namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 13 all three are bat viruses and cross over to cause human infection through an intermediate host civets for sars-cov camels for mers-cov and possibly pangolins for sars-cov-2 14 15 16 17 18 coronaviruses are enveloped viruses around 125 nm in diameter with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of around 30kb and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry this is wrapped in an icosahedral protein shell the surface has multiple club-shaped spikes which creates the appearance of solar corona on em the viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane m envelope e and spike s structural proteins are anchored all the coronaviruses use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors as a cellular entry receptor however the propensity of sars-cov-2 to attach to these receptors is much higher giving it high infectivity 13 there has been an intensive search for an effective drug against the virus or the resultant disease and has not led to any breakthrough agents few drugs namely hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir have been advocated as desperate measures to fight covid-19 based on a few preliminary contradictory and inconclusive studies 19 20 21 22 23 what we need is a drug that is at least 95 effective to stop the pandemic these and other drugs may save lives but are nowhere near that power to bring normalcy in the utter chaos caused by the pandemic 24 this leaves us with only one choice namely an effective and safe vaccine that shall be manufactured as soon as possible and available to all countries and populations affected by the pandemic at an affordable price 25 26 a vaccine has the power to generate herd immunity in the communities which will reduce the incidence of disease block transmission and reduce the social and economic burden of the disease very high immunization coverage can effectively fight the pandemic prevent secondary waves of infection and control the seasonal endemic infection outbursts eventually the disease can be eradicated as has happened in many other diseases that have had even with higher potential than covid-19 to cause pandemics namely smallpox poliomyelitis etc 27 28 a vaccine is medical preparations ranging from intact organisms attenuated live or inactivated to genetically engineered parts of the organisms antigenic that induce both arms of the adaptive immune system and stimulate a sufficient number of memory t cells and b lymphocytes 29 vaccines should contain antigens necessary to mount the specific response without causing disease once challenged with the pathogen memory cells yield effector t cells and antibody-producing b cells and fight the infection the antibodies have to be the neutralizing type which binds to the virus and block infection 30 the virus coated with neutralizing antibodies either cannot interact with the receptor or may be unable to uncoat of the genome most currently licensed vaccines to induce neutralizing antibody responses capable of mediating long-term protection against lytic viruses such as influenza and smallpox 31 the t cell-based responses that recognize and kill infected cells do also fight the infection 32 following antigen processing in dendritic cells the small peptides are displayed at the cell surface at the groove of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i and class ii molecules cytotoxic t cells cd8  recognize mhc class i-peptide complexes and differentiate into cytotoxic effector cells capable of killing infected cells or pathogens helper t cells cd4  recognize mhc class ii-peptide complexes and differentiate in effector cells that produce preferentially t helper th1 or th2 cytokines fig 1
 t helper cells 1 th1 support cd8  t-cell differentiation which is in contrast inhibited by t helper cells 2 th2 like cytokines vaccines against chronic pathogens namely mycobacterium tuberculosis malaria hcv hiv etc more often require cell-mediated immune responses to control the infection 33 the success of a vaccine against a pathogen is a complex issue and depends upon the biology of the virus and the type of immune response elicited by the body against the organism while vaccines have been successful against several pathogens including 14 major infectious diseases 27 28 not all infectious diseases are vaccine-preventable 34 35 the development of vaccines against hiv and hcv have proved challenging these viruses have an extreme genetic heterogeneity including the hypervariable regions target for neutralizing antibodies and the mutation contribute to immune escape 36 the mutations lead to a mixture of genomes in the patient over time and from patient to patient also antibodies mounted against such viral infections are predominantly non-neutralizing neutralizing antibodies are often either absent or weak to fight the pathogen or neutralize only a narrow range of circulating viral strains and only appear in a subgroup of patients who either recover or are elite controller 37 another aspect to be considered is whether the virus can be grown in cell culture and transmitted to small animals for experimentation since hcv has been discovered by molecular cloning in 1989 its propagation in cell culture has been difficult which hampers the ability of investigators to experiment with various antigenic components of the virus 38 does sars-cov-2 mutate how fast and will mutations cause a phenomenon of immune escape as is seen in hiv and hcv 34 35 sars-cov-2 has shown mutations as is true to every rna virus however the mutations are slow mild and mutants show nearly similar sequences as in the parent strain dorp et al 39 studied genomic diversity of sars-cov-2 and recorded 198 filtered recurrent mutations however most of the mutations were either neutral or even deleterious and of no clinical significance in vaccine immunity ahmad et al 40 found no mutations in 120 available sars-cov-2 sequences and identified a set of b cell and t cell epitopes derived from the spike s and nucleoproteinn proteins that map identically to sars-cov-2 proteins these findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 what type of immune response occurs in natural covid-19 and after vaccination and are antibodies neutralizing in nature sars-cov-2 infection evokes a robust adaptive immune response of both t cell and b cell type arms 41 42 furthermore both igm and igg antibodies appear around the 10th day of infection and most patients seroconvert within 3 weeks the antibodies are raised against internal nucleoprotein n and spike protein s of the virion and have neutralizing activity 43 now that several candidate vaccines are in the clinical trial investigators shall study the strength and nature of immune response against the vaccine antigen mostly spike protein are people who recover from covid-19 infection protected from a second or a third infection should re-infections occur it would imply that immune response against sars-cov-2 is not protective making possibilities of a successful vaccine difficult there were scary reports from south korea about patients thought to have recovered from covid-19 had tested positive again 44 an intense debate started about re-activation or re-infections of the virus soon these reports were put to rest and the positive sample were found to be residual dead fragments of the virus not the virus which had re-activated or re-infected 45 after these reports two groups of investigators have shown that sars-cov-2 antibodies are protective bao et al showed that 2 monkeys who recovered from sars-cov-2 infection were protected from re-infection on the challenge during convalescence 46 gao et al administered candidate vaccine picovacc sinovac biotech to mice rats and non-human primates the antibodies raised against the vaccine in animals showed neutralizing ability against sars-cov-2 strains three immunizations of two doses 3g or 6g per dose gave partial or complete protection in macaques against sars-cov-2 47 these data are exciting and if reproducible in humans confirm that vaccines against covid-19 shall be protective for the covid-19 vaccination program to succeed the antibody response mounted against the virusvaccine must be long-lasting as of today it is not possible to address this question as the virus has been in the community only for the last few months however we can take leads from data generated about the duration of immunity against 2 other coronaviruses namely sars-cov and mers-cov 14 17 both these viruses which are closely related to sars-cov-2 induce a robust t cell and b cell immune response which is long-lasting many candidate vaccines against both these viruses had gone through successful clinical trials and are safe and immunogenic 48 the greatest fear among vaccine developers is to create a vaccine that does not protect from infection but causes disease exacerbation increased morbidity and mortality 48 49 50 51 some vaccines can mount antibody-dependent enhancement ade which negates the basic purpose of vaccination 52 this response is mediated by the type of non-neutralizing antibodies mounted against infection or vaccination the immune response to such vaccines is subverted leading to exacerbated illness this could be due to fc receptor- or complement bearing cells-mediated mechanisms the fc-region of the antibody binds to fcr on the immune cells which subverts the immune response by reducing th1 cytokines il2 tnf-a and ifn-g and skews th2 cytokines il-10 il-6 pge-2 and inf-a and inhibits stat pathway leading to increased viral replication fig 2
 ade is of clinical significance in several viral infections including influenza rsv sars-cov mers-cov dengue virus zika virus and west nile virus considering ade is a major impediment to vaccine development efforts to identify highly selected epitopes have been done to avoid the production of antibodies responsible for disease enhancement ade has been reported in animals during vaccination trials with sars-cov and mers-cov 14 17 35 vaccine candidates against coronaviruses based on full-length spike protein induce non-neutralizing antibodies lack of protection of animals against a viral challenge and severe disease enhancement presenting as enhanced hepatitis increased morbidity and stronger inflammatory response 17 as of today there are no reports of ade with the use of covid-19 candidate vaccines in non-human primates and humans 51 however it is an early period in the development of these vaccines and as the matter is of major importance in the success of such a vaccine we need to be vigilant ade following covid-19 vaccination if reported can be prevented by shielding non-neutralizing epitopes of s protein by glycosylation or selecting critical neutralizing epitopes of the s antigen to elicit a more robust protective immunity given the above several facts about vaccine development are glaring vaccine development from the exploratory stage to marketing is a lengthy process and generally takes between 5 to 10 years for the covid-19 vaccine this period is being substantially compressed by the use of modern platform technology to develop the candidate vaccine pre-clinical stage and fast authorization by regulatory agencies for clinical trials it took moderna inc american biotechnology company based in cambridge massachusetts only 42 days from sequence analysis of the virus to create a new generation vaccine mrna-1273 at the companys cgmp facility this would have normally taken more than 2 years period without platform technology to develop such a vaccine however clinical trials that follow a unique protocol are rate-limiting and time-consuming here also to respond to the pandemic the investigators are exploring innovative methods of data collection many developers are running clinical trials in parallel phase i-ii to shorten the time for approval some have started collecting data on efficacy from phase ii itself iib there is an intense debate on whether challenge studies are ethical in covid-19 assessing the risk to a healthy volunteer 56 if allowed and done efficacy data on the covid-19 vaccine shall be available in a matter of weeks rather than years however it will be dangerous to grant authorization without proof that the covid-19 vaccine is immunogenic effective and safe the second item which needs consideration is the success rate of vaccine development from clinical trial authorization to licence typically this rate was 10 during the period 2000-2010 a 2016 study showed that around 20 of vaccine clinical trials make up from phase i to license 57 of the 37 vaccines developed for the ebola virus only one was licensed based on efficacy and safety in the phase ii trial in the covid-19 vaccine landscape investigators have introduced a few new generation vaccines based on nucleic acid technology such vaccine technology is not in clinical practice against any infectious disease and experts believe the success rate of such a vaccine to get licensed is not more than 5 58 59 it has also to be considered that vaccine development is a high cost and high-risk involvement 59 apart from competition between other major vaccine manufacturers the cost of developing a single new vaccine against an infectious disease exceeds us i billion the figure includes vaccines that are abandoned during the development process here given impending human catastrophe and global devastation several governmental and non-governmental agencies have supported institutions with sufficient funds the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi is a foundation that takes donations from public private philanthropic and civil society organizations to finance independent research projects to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases in march 2020 cepi announced the us  2 billion to accelerate the development of the covid-19 vaccine 60 similarly the us government has agreed to pay  483 million to moderna inc to develop the covid-19 vaccine 61 the canadian government has initiated a ca  13 billion innovation fund for vaccine research and development through 2022 62 researches are trialing several designs to develop candidate vaccines against covid-19 overall 8 types of designs under 4 broad groups have been tried to develop candidate covid-19 vaccines table 2
 each vaccine design has a subtle structure advantages and disadvantages in immunogenicity safety ease of use and effectiveness fig 1 29 69 70 table 3 live attenuated vaccine is developed by the process in which the live virus is passed through animal or human cells until genome mutates and is unable to cause disease the weekend virus replicates like a natural infection and causes strong t cell and b cell immune response which is long-lasting such vaccines are good to attain herd immunity in the population and block transmission of disease however there is a small chance of reversion of mutation to virulence and the occurrence of disease besides such vaccines need a cold chain for distribution to the community examples of such vaccines are bcg smallpox mmr measles mumps  rubella rotavirus poliomyelitis opv etc inactivated vaccines are treated with formaldehyde or heat and as the virus is killed such vaccines are safe and cannot cause disease however such vaccines do not replicate cause a suboptimum immune response and need repeated dosing and adjuvants to enhance immunity antibody-dependant enhancement has been reported in such vaccines and to avoid this we need to maintain the structure of epitopes on the surface antigen during inactivation examples of such vaccines include poliomyelitis ipv hav rabies etc nucleic acid vaccines are the new generation vaccines made available by modern technology a dna vaccine is made by inserting dna encoding the antigen from the pathogen into plasmid dna rna vaccines employ lipid-coated mrna of the sars-cov-2 which expresses spike protein the expressed proteins are presented by mhc class i to cd 8 t cells and inducing a strong t cell response these vaccines are safe easy to manufacture by the platform technology and maybe gamechanger in the future of vaccines as of today there are no nucleic acid vaccines in clinical practice recombinant vector virus vaccines are producing through recombinant dna technology this involves inserting the dna encoding an antigen from the pathogen into bacteria or virus vectors expressing the antigen in these cells and then purifying it from them 67 during vaccination the vector replicates and along with it the encoded dna is expressed and processed giving robust t cell and b cell immune response vectors may be bacteria like e coli or viruses like adenovirus or poxvirus classical examples of vector vaccines are hbv hpv whooping cough hib and meningococcus subunit vaccines composed of purified antigen peptides of viruses like spike protein of sars-cov-2 and are safe to use such an antigen is directly presented to mch class ii and often does not generate a robust cytotoxic t cell response mhc class i dependant thus such vaccines need repeated dosing and adjuvants to enhance immunity virus-like particles are made from empty virus particles without genetic material such vaccines are safe and immunogenic however are difficult to manufacture up till now several candidate vaccines have completed the exploratory and preclinical stage obtained clinical trial authorization and initiated recruitment of volunteers for clinical trials 72 of these six candidate vaccines stand at the forefront of clinical trials table 2 
ad5-ncov from cansino biologicals inc is a recombinant vaccine using adenovirus-vector cansino has an adenovirus-vector vaccine for ebola ad5-ebov that is in phase ii trials phase i trial has been completed on 108 volunteers however results have not been disclosed as of today at present phase ii trials are underway and cansino plans to enroll 500 volunteers to evaluate vaccine safety and immunogenicity 73 74 
mrna-1273 from moderna is a lipid encapsulated mrna vaccine and is undergoing safety and immune response phase i trial in seattle the company has filed for an ind to go for parallel phase ii trials 61 75 
picovacc from sinovac biotech is an inactivated virus vaccine and is undergoing parallel phase i-ii trials planned on 144 volunteers sinovac has partnered with us-based dynavax the vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies in mice rats and rhesus monkey which are protective in challenge experiments 47 76 
chadox1 from the university of oxford is an adenovirus vector-based vaccine and plans to run parallel phase i-ii trials on 510 volunteers for safety and efficacy the oxford group has experience with candidate vaccine for mers-cov chadox-mers and has undergone a successful phase i trial for safety the group is pushing ahead with an aggressive clinical plan and is talking of an emergency-use vaccine ready in september 2020 77 78 79 
bnt162 a1 b1 b2 c2 from biontehc is another lipid nanoparticle mrna vaccine and has received clearance from regulatory authority form germany to the start of phase i-ii trials on 196 volunteers the trial is dose escalation design 1 to 100 mcg using 4 vaccine subtypes a1 b1 b2 and c2 the developers have claimed to have an emergency-use vaccine by september 2020 80 
ino-4800 from inovio is a dna plasmid vaccine the company has experience with such platforms with candidate vaccines for mers and sars the vaccine needs a delivery system through electroporation which shall add to the cost of the vaccine phase i trial using two doses spaced four weeks apart has been completed and results shall be available in june 2020 inovio is planning to start phase ii-iii trials soon 81 numerous developers at present in the preclinical stage of vaccine development have indicated to procure clinical trial authorization by the regulatory agencies and initiate first-in-human vaccine testing covid-19 vaccine development has thrown major challenges in vaccine rd 82 the world is facing a major health catastrophe and economic devastation and one of the definitive solutions is to have an effective and safe vaccine in the shortest possible time the global vaccine rd efforts have been unprecedented in history the virus causing cvoid-19 has been sequenced in a few weeks ordinarily it has taken from 5 to 10 years to clone and sequence a virus from the time the disease is discovered there has been a tremendous race against time to develop candidate vaccine in a matter of few weeks and as of now 10 candidate vaccines have entered phase i-ii clinical trials it has taken us from 5 to 10 years in the history of vaccine development against other infectious agents to reach a stage as we are now with the covid-19 vaccine however clinical trials as are undergoing now will be the greatest limiting factor as these need time to acquire human data normally phase i ii and iii trials to be done on humans are completed between 2 to 5 years and sometimes more this is necessary for qualifying a vaccine to be safe immunogenic and efficacious as of today candidate vaccines are undergoing phase i or parallel i-ii studies and shall take several months for acquiring these data to start phase iii trials phase iii trial once initiated can take as long as 2 years to compress the period vaccine developers are involved in adopting parallel and adaptive development phases i-ii to acquire safety and immunogenicity data as soon as possible to initiate phase iii trials by any imagination these data shall not be available by early 2021 for any vaccine for regulatory authorities to allow vaccine marketing covid-19 vaccines could be available for human use earlier if innovative methods of clinical trials and regulatory processes are employed one such is the use of challenge studies to testify vaccine efficacy 56 here following proof of safety and immunogenicity in phase i-ii trials controlled challenge studies which can be completed in a matter of weeks are done to confirm vaccine efficacy challenge studies have been done in the past in other infectious diseases namely influenza typhoid fever cholera and malaria whether challenge studies are ethical in covid-19 considering the risk to the volunteer is a matter of debate before the vaccine developers 83 also regularity authorities can use innovative procedures to allow guarded emergency use of a vaccine this would need careful consideration of interventional animal safety data and data of safety immunogenicity and efficacy acquired from phase i-ii trials with all this vaccine developers have to be ready to scale manufacturing capacity to massive demands once the product is allowed for marketing 25 however concerns are raised about a rush to deploy a covid-19 vaccine applying quick fix and short cuts can lead to errors with disastrous consequences 84 what regulators have to worry about is the atmosphere of hype about the covid-19 vaccine public claims about breakthrough research based on poorly conducted studies or data collected through fraud is a real possibility all data which form the basis of any findings need to be scrutinized and should be confirmed by other investigators relaxion on regulatory principles based on political pressure and goodwill needs to be resisted and one needs to protect the interests of volunteers who are a part of such experiments 85 lastly vaccine development is a risky process and one critical issue in the covid-19 vaccine would-be the occurrence of antibody-dependent enhancement ade which may be disastrous for those receiving the vaccine 49 50 regulators have to take all precautions to discourage candidate vaccines which may show such a phenomenon 
mohammad sultan khuroo conceptualization reviewing and editing software mohammad khuroo software mehnaaz s khuroo writing and first draft ahmad a sofi supervision reviewing and editing  from sars-cov to sars-cov-2 safety and broad-spectrum are important for coronavirus vaccine development cuiqing ma shan su jiachao wang lin wei lanying du shibo jiang   sars-cov-2 is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus generally coronavirus falls into four genera--    on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures  and  coronaviruses infect only mammals while the  and  coronaviruses mainly infect birds
22 23 24 25
 among them there are 7 species that can infect human beings that is common coronavirus including hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 that belong to  coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and cov-hku1 that belong to  coronaviruses and three highly pathogenic viruses sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 that all belong to  coronaviruses17

26

27 the novel coronavirus was initially isolated from three patients and the complete genome sequences were obtained the three sars-cov-2 genomes clustered together within the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows the typical -coronavirus organization a 5 untranslated region utr replicase complex orf1ab s gene e gene m gene n gene 3 utr and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames
1
 chinese researchers have found that a gene sequence of coronavirus carried by chinese rhinolophine is 96 identical with that of sars-cov-2 thus rhinolophine is considered as the natural host of sars-cov-227

28 unfortunately the intermediate host has not been determined yet although it is speculated that pangolin may be the intermediate host based on the results of gene comparison it was showed that sars-cov-2 was closely related with 88 identity to two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 collected in 2018 in zhoushan eastern china and sars-cov about 79 identity but was more distant from mers-cov about 50 identity
29
 furthermore according to the rich knowledge about sars-cov and the newly released sequence of sars-cov-2 the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 including its receptor-binding motif rbm that directly contacts angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is similar to that of sars-cov strongly suggesting that sars-cov-2 uses ace2 as its receptor
30
 currently more structural and functional studies confirmed that ace2 acted as the receptor for sars-cov-231

32 it is known that most of the current influenza vaccines are inactivated vaccines which plays a very important role in protecting people from influenza virus infection some approaches such as formaldehyde uv light and -propiolactone have been applied in the preparation of inactivated vaccines against sars-cov which generally induced robust serum-neutralizing antibody ab response in different immunized animals
39 40 41
 for instance he y et al showed that high-titer antibodies elicited by the inactivated sars-cov in the immunized animals could recognize s protein especially the receptor-binding domain rbd in the s1 subunit and potently block sars-cov entry
42
 some groups evaluated the safety of the inactivated vaccine for sars-cov and the results showed that all vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody and significant reductions of sars-cov after viral challenge however challenge of mice given any of the inactivated vaccines led to occurrence of lung lesion based on th2-biased immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration
43 44 45
 in addition fan luo et al intramuscularly immunized chinese rhesus macaques with 25 g beta-propiolactone-inactivated whole sars-cov z-1 vaccine and boosted the immunization on day 7 although this study revealed no exacerbation of infection in the immunized macaques following the challenge with sars-cov ns-1 the authors suggested that an antibody-dependent enhancement ade assay should be performed in vitro to examine whether the immune sera induced by inactivated vaccine would mediate ade in some cell lines such as k562 thp-1 and monkeys peripheral blood mononuclear cells
46
 therefore we should be cautious in using the inactivated sars-cov as a vaccine since it may cause harmful immune andor inflammatory responses historically and contemporarily live-attenuated vaccines have been used successfully in controlling measles mumps rubella polio yellow fever and chickenpox infections and outbreaks47

48 some researchers constructed recombinant forms of the full-length sars-cov s protein or rbd of s protein that was encoded into the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara mva
49
 recombinant adeno-associated virus raav
50
 or an attenuated parainfluenza virus bhpiv3 respectively51

52 balbc mice were inoculated intranasally or intramuscularly with mvas and neutralizing antibodies were induced moreover mvas administered by either route elicited protective immunity as shown by reduced titers of sars-cov in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the mice after viral challenge du let al evaluated the immune protection of a raav encoding rbd vaccine in mouse model by intranasal inoculation which induced strong mucosal immune responses and provided long-term protection against sars-cov infection
53
 other groups reported that immunization of monkeys via the respiratory tract with bhpiv3sars-s induced the production of sars-cov-neutralizing serum antibodies after the challenge with sars-cov all monkeys inoculated with bhpiv3sars-s did not shed any sars-cov while monkeys in control group shed sars-cov for 5-8 days49

52 weingartl h et al immunized ferrets with rmva-s and the immunized ferrets developed a more rapid and vigorous neutralizing antibody response compared with control animals however after challenge with sars-cov they also exhibited stronger inammatory responses in liver tissue than control animals suggesting that vaccination with rmva-s is associated with enhanced hepatitis
54
 which is not seen in the above infection model it is suggested that we should not only use mice or monkeys as animal model but also use ferrets as the infection model because of its sensitivity to sars-cov thus sometimes we do not observe the pathological damage caused by vaccine immunization which may be that the animal model used is not representative enough notably live-attenuated vaccines are associated with the risk of reversion by either mutation- or recombination-driven processes which can cause dangerous outbreaks in unvaccinated populations including animals
48
 several groups have tried to develop novel strategies in controlling fidelity and attenuating rna virus pathogenesis in the case of coronavirus some mutants have been identified to prevent reversion to repaired virulence55

56 rachel l graham et al provided a proof that rewiring the transcription regulatory networks trns limited reversion in an live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate which are effective against sars-cov
56
 some sars-cov vaccine candidates were tested in clinical trials showing that they could elicit antibody responses and are safe57

58 although their long-term safety profiles have not been reported envelope s protein is the most important surface protein of coronavirus figure 2
 which is related to the viral infectivity the s protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion59

60 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity61

62 generally the s protein of coronavirus is functionally divided into the s1 subunit responsible for receptor binding and the s2 subunit responsible for cell membrane fusion
63 64 65 66
 by aligning sars-cov-2 s protein sequence with those of sars-cov and several bat-sl-covs we predicted that the cleavage site for generating s1 and s2 subunits is located at r694s695
67
 in addition it has been reported that s protein has strong immunogenicity and can induce high titer neutralizing antibody
63
 rbd of sars-cov s1 is located in s318-510 and the key rbm is s425-494 of which r453 is critical for the complex formation
68
 notably n479 and t487 of the rbd are important for the high-affinity association of s protein with ace2
69 70 71 72
 residues 442 472 and 480 also contribute to receptor recognition and host range of sars-cov although not as much as residues 479 and 48725

73

74 besides a point mutation at r441 or d454 of the rbd of sars-cov disrupts the antigenic structure and binding activity of rbd to ace275

76 by comparing the amino acid sequence of s protein between sars-cov-2 and sars cov it was found that the similarities of primary sequence between sars-cov-2-s and sars-cov-s isolated from human civet or bat are around 76-78 for the whole protein around 73-76 for the rbd and 50-53 for the rbm7

30 in s1 subunit sars-cov-2 and sars-cov shared around 50 conserved amino acids and the three-dimensional structure of sars-cov-2 rbd was composed of a core and an external subdomain which was more similar to that of sars-cov
29
 we aligned the sequence of s protein between sars-cov ncbi reference sequence nc0047183 and sars-cov-2 ncbi reference sequence nc0455122 as shown in figure 3
a the five key residues responsible for the binding of the sars-cov rbd residues 442 472 479 480 and 487 sars-cov numbering to the ace2 receptor were variable in the sars-cov-2 rbd residues 455 485 493 494 and 501 sars-cov-2 numbering although the five critical residues in sars-cov-2 rbm were different with that of sars-cov residue gln493 provide favorable interactions with human ace2 consistent with sars-cov-2s capacity for human cell infection other critical residues in sars-cov-2 rbm particularly asn501 are compatible with but not ideal for binding human ace2 suggesting that sars-cov-2 has acquired capacity for human-to-human transmission phylogenetic analysis indicates that sars-cov-2 also potentially recognizes ace2 from a diversity of animal species except for mice and rats implicating that these animal species may act as intermediate hosts or animal models for sars-cov-2 infections
30
 s2 subunit of coronavirus is divided into two domains hr1 and hr2 we confirmed that sars-cov-2 hr1 and hr2 regions are able to interact with each other to form six helix bundle 6-hb which brings the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity for fusion64

77 as shown in figure 3b several amino acid residues in hr1 of sars-cov-2 which are concentrated from 922 to 943 were variable with sars-cov residues 904-925 while hr2 is completely identical between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov not shown suggesting that sars-cov-2 s2 especially hr2 is a conserved target for pan-coronavirus vaccine together these results suggest that s protein plays an important role in the infection and immunogenicity of coronavirus which promotes some research teams to prepare a vaccine based on full-length s protein of sars-cov-2 a number of vaccine candidates based on the full-length s protein of sars-cov have been reported in succession and generally could induce high level of immune response and potent protective immunity35

78 79 80 for example the expression of full-length s protein and its trimer of urbani strain by recombinant baculovirus can induce adequate neutralizing antibody against human and palm civet sars pseudoviruses that bears s proteins of homologous or heterologous sars-cov variants such as tor2 gd03t13 and sz3 strains in vaccinated mice
81
 these reports suggested that the full-length s protein is highly immunogenic and able to induce protection against sars-cov challenge besides the neutralizing antibodies alone may be able to suppress virus proliferation however the risk in safety and final protective effect of the full-length s protein-based vaccine should not be underestimated some groups reported that although full-length s protein of sars-cov elicited a neutralizing antibody response it also induced harmful immune responses including triggered infection of human b cells or other immune cells by sars-cov and enhanced sars-cov infection with anti-sars-cov-s immune-serum after challenge with homologous sars-cov
82 83 84
 last year liu l et al identified that anti-s protein igg in productively infected lungs caused severe acute lung injury by skewing inflammation-resolving response in sars-cov macaque models subsequently these antibodies were injected into healthy macaques that were then challenged with sars-cov interestingly the macaques receiving the antibodies showed more severe lung injury than the control group indicating that antibody induced by sars s protein vaccine candidate may cause antibody dependent enhancement ade
85
 thus it is speculated that the s protein of sars-cov contains some epitopes which may induce humoral or cellular immune responses that exacerbate the pathology in some coronavirus infections
86
 protein science an american biotechnology company once spent tens of millions to make a full-length s-protein vaccine of sars-cov however the vaccine development was suspended because of the safety problems in the immunized animals exactly liu g et al found that peptide s597-603 of s protein induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates
87
 perhaps s protein-based vaccines against sars-cov could be engineered to avoid ade via elimination of the s597-603 epitope full length s protein has been truncated into rbd as a vaccine candidate rbd of sars-cov-s contains major antigenic epitopes that can induce not only neutralizing antibodies but also cd8 t cell-responses43

63

88 89 90 91 he yet al identified the neutralizing epitopes on the rbd of sars-cov-s by a panel of 27 mabs isolated from the immunized mice six structure-dependent epitopes and two adjacent linear epitopes were found suggesting that the epitopes capable of inducing highly potent neutralizing ab responses are mainly conformational epitopes 92 in addition the neutralizing epitopes in mers-cov rbd was confirmed to be mainly conformational as well93

94 the modifications in amino acid residues of mers-cov-s-rbd based on the structure design could improve its protection against mers-cov infection
94
 enlightening that s-rbd or modified s-rbd of sars-cov-2 is promising for the development of vaccine against sars-cov-2 we have compared the immunogenicity and immune protection of rbd vaccine with full-length s protein the results suggested that the rbd from either sars-cov or mers-cov had induced ab responses with higher titer more potent neutralizing activity and provided longer-term protection in vivo against sars-cov infection compared with that induced by full-length s protein more importantly sars-cov rbd did not cause immune damage in the animal model while full-length s protein could do51

95 96 97 it is speculated that there are some super-antigens in the region beyond the rbd of the full-length s protein in this way after the full-length s protein enters the animal model it will induce abundant non-specific antibodies and immune cell activation subsequently eliciting a large amount of cytokines which will lead to severe immune damage just like the pathogenic course of sars-cov but why the antibody titer induced by full-length s protein is not as high as that induced by rbd it is speculated that the antigen competition might result in a lower level of neutralizing antibody induced by full-length s protein than that induced by rbd therefore rbd-based subunit vaccine may be the ideal and safer alternative for the development of coronavirus vaccine interestingly some groups also found that the recombinant rbds derived from the s protein of tor2 gd03 and sz3 the representative strains of human 20022003 and 20032004 sars-cov and palm civet sars-cov respectively induced high titers of cross-neutralizing abs against pseudoviruses expressing s proteins of tor2 gd03 and sz3
98
 suggesting that the major neutralizing epitopes of sars-cov are maintained in the process of cross species transmission thus rbd-based vaccines could induce extensive protection against human and animal sars-cov variants probably the rbd of s protein may serve as one of the most effective and safest vaccines for the prevention of sars since both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov recognize ace2 on the cell surface as the receptor can rbd-based sars-cov-specific vaccines cross protect individuals from sars-cov-2 infection unfortunately ying t et al showed that the most potent sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies eg m396 cr3014 that target the ace2 binding site of sars-cov failed to bind sars-cov-2 s protein indicating that the different amino acids in rbd between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 has an important effect on the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies
99
 sars-cov s2 subunit which is responsible for fusion between virus and target cell membranes is expected to be a vaccine candidate against sars-cov66

100

101 several groups showed that s2 of sars-cov andor mers-cov s protein could induce neutralizing antibodies although their neutralizing potency is generally lower than that of antibodies specific for rbd
102 103 104
 however guo et al investigated the immune responses against the recombinant s2 fragment residues 681-980 in balbc mice and found that the s2 fragment could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total igg but little neutralizing antibodies against infection by sars-cov
105
 additionally zeng f et al purified the total s1- and s2-specific igg from mice immunized with recombinant s1 or s2 proteins respectively and found that anti-s1 and anti-s2 iggs were able to abolish the binding between s protein and its cellular receptors although anti-s1 igg showed a significantly higher blocking efficiency
106
 as shown in figure 2b the amino acid sequences of hr1 and hr2 are highly conserved and homologous between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in fact these domains are also highly conserved in other coronaviruses
104
 thus the s2 subunit has potential to be used as a target for the development of pan-cov vaccine against divergent virus strains altogether these results suggested that the s2 domain of sars-cov s protein as a vaccine candidate may be able to prevent the infection of sars-cov sars-cov can also bind to host cells through alternative receptors such as dc-sign dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin andor lsign liverlymph node-sign107

108 seven asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in the s protein including residues at positions 109 118 119 158 227 589 and 699 are crucial for dc-sign-or l-sign-mediated virus entry
109
 notably a sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibody cr3022 could bind potently with sars-cov-2 rbd however the epitope of cr3022 does not overlap with the ace2 binding site within sars-cov-2 rbd
99
 suggesting that sars-cov-2 may also have other receptor binding sites except for ace2 which should be noted in our vaccine design against sars-cov-2 besides optimization of sequences components or immunization routes inclusion of appropriate adjuvants or application of combinational immunization approaches are usually required for preparing an effective vaccine110

111 all these above results indicated that the modification of the sars-cov s protein specifically by retaining the conserved amino acids especially the conserved sequence in the rbd region and removing the possible epitopes that may cause immune damage may be a good strategy to prepare a broad-spectrum vaccine against sars-cov and sars-cov-related virus very recently many research teams have launched the development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 the safety is a crucial issue that we need to be aware of when making vaccines meanwhile there is another issue needs attention the human and civet isolates of sars-cov nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of sars-cov-like sl-cov strains isolated from the bats and the civets may have served as intermediate amplification hosts that enable sars-cov to cross species for animal-to-human transmission70

112 113 114 115 additionally rna virus might well mutate in ways that would make previously effective vaccines useless thus development of a safe and effective vaccine against both human and animal sars-cov strains is highly important for preventing future sars outbreaks on the other hand given the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses increasing humananimal interface activities the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of cov genomes novel coronaviruses are likely to emerge periodically in humans due to frequent cross-species infections and occasional spillover events a broad-spectrum sars vaccine that is effective against all the coronaviruses using ace2 as their receptor can be applied immediately when we face the recurrent threat of coronavirus particularly taken sars-cov-2 as an example the virus might disappear before the vaccine is developed therefore development of safe and broad-spectrum vaccines against sars-cov-2 and other sars-cov-related virus is of great significance for protecting human from cov infection based on the above analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various vaccines against sars-cov the modified s protein is expected to be a candidate for a cross protective vaccine against sars-cov and sars-cov-related virus notably we have recently demonstrated that a vaccine based on rbd of s protein against sars-cov could effectively cross neutralize sars-cov-2 moreover several scientists have tried to design a vaccine against all -coronavirus especially these ace2-associated ones in addition to antigens adjuvants can enhance the immune response and reduce the amount of antigen required for each dose of vaccine so that more doses of vaccine can be produced and provided to more people the choice of adjuvants also affects the efficacy of respiratory virus vaccines and adjuvant has also been applied in the rd of sars-cov-2 vaccine lung is a complex organ which is rich in immune cells such as macrophages the pulmonary epithelial cells aecs also have the characteristics of some immune cells such as secreting a large number of pulmonary surfactant a d ps-a ps-d the ps layer forms a strong barrier to prevent nanoparticles and hydrophilic molecules from accessing them so as to protect the aecs from pathological damage
116
 type i interferons ifn-is are the chief immune mediators to protect the body from viral infections and can be secreted by aecs as well as immune cells following viral infection therefore the activation of stimulator of interferon genes sting in these two cell types can effectively enhance the production of ifn-i and recapitulate the immune responses provoked by viral infection
117
 however it is still a great challenge to delivery stng agonists into the cytosol of aecs without destroying the integrity of ps layer recently two research teams from china and the united states cooperated to ingeniously use ps-biomimetic liposomes ps-gamp to encapsulated 23-cyclic guanosine monophosphateadenosine monophosphate cgamp a natural and effective sting agonist118

119 because of its resemblance to ps ps-gamp disguises self and escapes from immune surveillance following intranasal immunization together with sp-a and sp-d ps-gamp enters the alveolar macrophages ams from which ps-gamp fluxes into aecs through gap junctions between ams and aecs subsequently the sting pathway in ams and aecs was activated without breaching ps and alveolar epithelial barriers through this mechanism the adjuvant ps-gamp combined with inactivated h1n1 vaccine generated broad-spectrum cross protection not only effectively against h1n1 but also against heterosubtypic h3n2 h5n1 and h7n9 virus infection within two days after a single immunization this cross protection lasted for at least 6 months and induced the persistence of lung cd8 trm cells in vivo it is also showed that ps-gamp could enhance the recruitment and differentiation of cd11b dendritic cells dc and cd8 t cells as well as the humoral response
120
 thus ps-gamp strategy is a promising universal mucosal adjuvant for developing broad-spectrum vaccines against betacoronavirus lineage b sars-cov sars-cov-2 sarsr-covs there was a significantly harmful immune response after immunizing animals with inactivated vaccine against sars-cov following challenge with the homotypic virus although no obvious safety problem was observed in animal model after immunization in addition the inactivated vaccine against one serotype of dengue virus denv can enhance individual infection with other serotypes
121
 these observations suggested that harmful response after immunization with inactivated vaccine against sars-cov-2 might also happen even if the inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine does not elicit serious harmful immune response it may enhance the infection of the mutated andor another novel coronavirus by ade the subunit vaccine based on rbd can avoid ade however rbm cannot serve as a universal vaccine candidate because of its large variation among different virus strains the biggest advantage of mrna and dna vaccines or vector vaccines that is currently under clinical trials in the united states is that they do not need adjuvants however there are still potential safety risks of these mrna or dna vaccines therefore the modified rbd combined with t cell epitopes and effective mucosal adjuvants will be the best choice for the preparation of a broad-spectrum and safe coronavirus vaccine of course it should be noted that the choice of vaccine depends on the mortality rate of the disease for infectious diseases with high mortality such as ebov the effectiveness of vaccines is more important than safety however for low mortality disease such as covid-19 the safety of vaccines is more important than effectiveness additional safety concerns relate to effectiveness and safety against antigenic variants of sars-cov and for safety of vaccinated persons exposed to other coronaviruses in a word a safe and effective vaccine for covid-19 is urgently needed however regulators need to evaluate its safety through a series of virus strains and more than one animal model before allowing the covid-19 vaccines to be used in humans simultaneously regulators should also see strong preclinical evidence that vaccines can prevent infection and we should speed up the rd progress on the premise of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine
122
 in addition the vaccine preparation and adjuvant selection for sars-cov-2 in the future should attach great importance to its broad-spectrum cross protection so that if there is similar virus diseases emerged in humans or animals the vaccine can be applied immediately to exert its protective effect the authors declare no conflict of interest  viral vaccine meeting held in barcelona october 2528 2003 acm boon s plotkin gf rimmelzwaan adme osterhaus   ann arvin stanford university ca usa presented us the latest on varicella zoster vaccine development 1 in 1995 the food and drug administration fda approved the use of a live-attenuated la varicella zoster virus vzv oka-strain vaccine vaccination has now commenced in many countries after 6 years of clinical practice it is now clear that the vaccine is 85 effective in providing protection against infection with wild-type wt virus and 95 efficacious in protection against serious disease breakthrough infections of vaccine virus occurred in 12 of the vaccinees and were generally very mild zoster caused by the reactivation of vzv from latency is a common among hematopoietic-cell transplant recipients vaccination with inactivated vzv vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of zoster in these individuals which correlated with reconstitution of vzv-specific cd4 t-cell immunity 2 stanley plotkin addressed the latest developments on vaccination against cytomegalovirus cmv 3 congenital infections with cmv are the most common cause of neurological disorders in infants in the united states cmv is transmitted in 1 of all births causing death or sequala in 20 of these cases to prevent these deaths as well as cmv infection in transplants recipient patients researchers have started to explore the possibilities for vaccination against cmv currently four different cmv candidate vaccines are tested in phase i and ii trials the la vaccine based on the towne strain induced good immunity including neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity which correlate with protection however the immune response lagged behind that of a natural infection to increase the immunogenicity of the towne la vaccine which lacks nineteen open reading frames orf and lost its capacity to establish latency some of the orf of the more virulent toledo strain of cmv will be introduced into the towne vaccine strain in addition to these two candidate la vaccines a sub-unit candidate vaccine comprising of the gb glycoprotein and a canarypox vector containing the pp65 and iei exon 4 are being tested in phase i trials the former induces antibodies whereas the latter induces a strong cellular immune response at the other end of the age spectrum are the elderly which generally have a reduced immune function of the innate and adaptive immune system this so-called immunosenescence is the cause of increased morbidity and mortality in this age group because of the reduced immune function vaccine efficacies are often lower in the elderly and vaccines have to be more immunogenic to obtain similar seroconversion rates michael roggendorf university of essen essen germany showed that the immunogenicity of hepatitis a virus hav and hepatitis b virus hbv vaccine is lower in the elderly as was measured by seroconversion rates 4 interestingly the efficacy of the hav and hbv vaccine differed in individuals over 60 years of age 71 and 375 seroconversion respectively which may be dependent on the nature of the vaccine formulations lluis salleras autonomous government of catalonia barcelona spain further elaborated on vaccine efficacy and demonstrated that hav and hbv vaccination in pre-adolescent schoolchildren was 90 effective in protection from disease 5 respiratory syncytial virus rsv is a single-stranded negative sense rna virus belonging to the family of paramyxoviridae genus pneumovirus upon infection the virus can cause upper respiratory tract disease in all age groups however severe complications are more often seen in the very young elderly and bone marrow transplant patients in the late 1960s vaccination experiments were conducted in young children using formalin-inactivated rsv fi-rsv upon infection with a wt strain of rsv some of these children suffered from severe complications resulting in death this phenomenon of enhanced disease in fi-rsv vaccinated children has hampered further rsv vaccine research enormously understanding the mechanisms of disease enhancement is a key issue crucial to rsv vaccine development peter openshaw and his co-workers have been studying enhanced disease in mice for many years the possible involvement of  t cells in human bronchiolitis has recently been highlighted 6 and depletion of these unconventional t cells can prevent enhanced disease in rsv-infected mice previously sensitized by scarification with vaccinia viruses encoding single rsv proteins among the target population for vaccination are very young children under 1 year of age the presence of maternal antibodies and the immaturity of the immune system may reduce the immunogenicity of vaccines in these children james crowe investigated the ability of b cells from very young children to produce neutralizing antibodies which are important for protective immunity following natural infections the immunoglobulin ig region of b cells producing rsv-specific antibodies was sequenced gene rearrangements resulting in a complete vdj region in the immunoglobulin occurred in the rsv-specific b cells however b cells from infants less than 3 months old exhibited a striking paucity of somatic mutations in vh genes indicating that they are unable to produce high quality neutralizing antibodies potential vaccine candidates for rsv include adenovirus recombinants immune stimulating complex iscom preparations and sub-unit vaccines as well as la virus vaccines la virus vaccines are known to induce humoral and cellular immune responses a presentation by miranda de graaf erasmus mc rotterdam netherlands demonstrated the possibilities of reverse genetics in creating la viruses this work was done using human metapneumovirus hmpv a virus causing similar disease as rsv exchanging the polymerase genes between the two different lineages of hmpv attenuated the ability to induce chloramphenicol acetyl transferase cat activity from a mini-genome containing a cat reporter gene flanked by the hmpv genomic ends using the full-length hmpv genome instead of a reporter gene resulted in the rescue of recombinant viable viruses 7 this system could produce attenuated viruses that may be used for vaccine purposes passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies is an available treatment for rsv because of the relatively short half-life of these antibodies it is essential that the administration of the antibodies coincide with the rsv epidemic season of which the onset varies from year-to-year the pid-ari network pediatric infectious diseases network on acute respiratory tract infections currently identifies 19 different viral and bacterial pathogens using a multiplex pcr in children between 0 and 16 years old josef weigl christian albrechts university kiel germany showed that last year the start of the rsv epidemic was 5 weeks prior to the onset of antibody administration unnecessarily endangering these children to an infection with rsv these data support the need to synchronize the application of preventive antibody treatment with rsv epidemics finally rob moormann animal sciences group of wageningen lelystad netherlands presented the latest on bovine rsv vaccine development vaccination with fi-rsv induced enhanced disease in these animals including eosinophil influx and an ige response 8 a second important respiratory pathogen is influenza virus this segmented negative sense single-stranded rna virus has been responsible for three major pandemics in the 20th century as well as annual epidemics in contrast to rsv the correlates of protection are well documented and include the presence of neutralizing antibodies and probably t-cell responses influenza vaccine research is focusing on two areas the development of an influenza vaccine for a pandemic situation and the development of alternative influenza vaccines preventing disease following infection with epidemic viruses annually the classical influenza vaccine is a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and is administered each year by injection harry greenberg stanford university school of medicine ca usa gave an overview on the development of a cold-adapted ca influenza vaccine flumist which is now approved by the fda for use in individuals between 5 and 49 years of age ca viruses are capable of growing at low temperatures 25 c and are attenuated at body temperatures the genetic basis of attenuation for influenza a virus aann arbor660 has now been identified and was limited to 4 amino-acid aa changes on the polymerase proteins pb1 3 aa and pb2 1 aa as well as 1 aa change on the nucleoprotein np 9 flumist is applied intranasally has been shown to be effective and has a low transmission rate in highly susceptible young children in a day care setting in the future the medical importance of a possible association between asthma and the use of flumist in young children needs to be investigated finally additional data confirming and extending the apparent safety and efficacy of flumist in individuals over 50 years of age should be obtained the production of influenza vaccines in embryonated chicken eggs and the generation of master reassortant vaccine strains are time consuming and inflexible procedures are hampering the rapid development of pandemic influenza vaccines the advent of vero and madindarby canine kidney mdck cell lines registered for vaccine production will facilitate flexible vaccine production in the future by companies like baxter vaccines ag and solvay pharmaceuticals bv 10 11 reverse genetics will be an alternative tool for the generation of reassortant vaccine strains john wood national institute for biological standards and control london uk elaborated on the possibilities of these new approaches and pointed out that licensing issues should be dealt with in order to make quick licensing of candidate vaccines possible in events of a future pandemic threat 12 13 catherine ammon mph geneva switzerland discussed the poor public awareness of the dangers of influenza amongst swiss elderly 14 although the elderly realized that they belong to the high-risk group bad experiences doubt about the efficacy and side effects had reduced the number of individuals willing to take the vaccine to ensure effective use of influenza vaccines it is imperative that public awareness is increased and maintained at a high level dengue virus is a serious health threat to the human population infecting 50100 million individuals each year worldwide robert putnak walter reed army institute of research md usa presented an overview of dengue virus vaccine candidates which are currently being tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials one of the major issues concerning dengue virus infections is the occurrence of dengue hemorrhagic fever dhf and dengue shock syndrome dss in a small percentage of infected individuals dhf and dss can occur after a primary infection but occur much more frequently after secondary dengue virus infections with a serotype different from that during primary infection it was suggested that antibody mediated enhancement and waning immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of these complications early dengue virus candidate vaccines consisted of la virus strains developed by dr a sabin vaccination studies demonstrated that la candidate vaccines partially protected against challenge with live virus was safe well tolerated and immunogenic since the who resolution on dengue virus in 1995 four different candidate vaccines are currently being evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical trials including two candidate la virus vaccines and two recombinant candidate vaccines the monovalent la vaccine candidates varied in immunogenicity and the four serotypes of dengue virus interfered with each other multiple doses of vaccine given 3 months apart were required to obtain satisfying seroconversion rates a recombinant dengue virus serotype 4 den-430 developed by the national institute of health is also a promising candidate inducing a 95100 seroconversion rate in human volunteers a recombinant yellow-fever yf virus containing the prm and envelop e protein of dengue virus chimerivax konstantin pugachev acambis inc ma usa proved to have potential a single dose with all four serotypes provided 83100 protection against challenge infection 180 days later in cynomolguos macaques
15 also candidate sub-unit vaccines have been developed for dengue virus carolyn weeks-levy hawaii biotech inc hi usa presented data on a sub-unit candidate vaccine consisting of recombinant envelope protein e lacking the transmembrane region interestingly monkeys vaccinated with high doses of monovalent serotype 2 dengue virus den-2 e protein became viremic upon infection with den-2 while lower vaccine dosages did not result in viremia addition of non-structural ns-1 protein increased the cellular immune response and improved protective immunity wellington sun walter reed army institute of research md usa compared candidate dengue virus vaccine efficacies observed in humans and monkeys monkeys are permissive for infection with dengue virus but they do not show any disease symptoms including dhf or dss upon infection these animals clear the virus and develop antibodies that are partially cross-protective at present it is unclear whether the monkey model is valid for predicting the outcome of vaccination in humans 16 seroconversion rates of mono- and tetravalent candidate vaccines were generally lower in humans than in monkeys the den-430 and the chimerivax-d2 a recombinant yf virus containing the prm and envelop e protein of dengue virus serotype 2 candidate vaccines elicited seroconversion rates in humans of 95 the walter reed group has conducted a serotype 1 dengue den-1 and serotype 3 dengue den-3 virus challenge study of subjects vaccinated with their tetravalent la candidate vaccine results indicated that the rhesus monkey viremia correlated well with results in humans although the human challenge model is important in validating vaccine efficacies its role in vaccine development remains to be defined regina kofler university of vienna vienna austria described the isolation of an attenuated tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev with a deletion in the capsid protein second-site mutations have restored the capacity of this attenuated virus to replicate in cell-culture these mutants were shown to have the potential for the development of a live flavivirus vaccine 17 yf virus strain 17d yf-17d is an attenuated virus strain which has lost the viscerotropic neurotropic and vector competence phenotypes of wild-type yf virus and has been used as a backbone in vaccines for the induction of immunity against other flaviviruses therefore full understanding of the molecular determinants for attenuation and virulence is of importance alan barrett university of texas medical branch galveston usa showed that none of the 20 aa substitutions in yf-17d could be linked to neuro- and hepatotropism however the e and ns4b protein may be important in determining the virus phenotype 18 19 the second member of the flaviviridae family with a high impact on human health is hepatitis c virus hcv it was originally identified in 1989 and believed to have infected over 200 million people worldwide approximately 1545 of the hcv acute infections are resolved spontaneously which appears to be associated with strong cd4 t-helper cell and antibody responses currently the main aim of vaccination is to prevent the occurrence of chronic liver disease after infection with hcv since chimpanzees are the only other species than humans susceptible for infection they are used to evaluate the efficacy of hcv candidate vaccines michael houghton chiron corporation ca usa demonstrated that vaccination with adjuvated recombinant glycoprotein gp e1 and e2 and subsequent challenge with hcv rna significantly reduced the incidence of chronic disease in chimpanzees 20 in the same study sterile immunity was associated with high levels of neutralizing antibodies these neutralizing antibodies may prevent binding of hcv particles to cd80 as was demonstrated in vitro with hyper-immune serum from infected individuals currently the gpe1 and gpe2 sub-unit candidate vaccine is being tested in phase i trials in 1999 west nile virus wnv was introduced in the usa which has prompted an extra effort to develop a vaccine wnv is transmitted from birds to humans by mosquitoes and causes febrile illness in approximately 20 of infected individuals in 08 of the infected individuals infection results in neurological disorders followed by death in 515 of these cases michael lieberman hawaii biotech inc hi usa showed that vaccination with truncated e protein of wnv protected golden hamsters from infection with wnv 21 22 further evaluation of this candidate sub-unit vaccine the acambis chimeric and the fort dodge killed candidate vaccine will be needed to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans lorne babiuk university of saskatoon sask canada introduced the field of veterinary vaccinology veterinary vaccines also have to be safe efficacious and perhaps in contrast to vaccines for human use generally have to be cheap and fit existing practices furthermore veterinary vaccines can often be evaluated directly in the targeted species in addition to conventional live and inactivated vaccines also genetically engineered chimeric dna plant-based and replication defective veterinary vaccines are available some of these vaccines aim at the induction of protective immunity to human pathogens in order to prevent the contamination of food and water by these agents which also include the bacteria escherichia coli e coli strain o157 campylobacter and salmonella
23 the alvac vector or canarypox vector is one of the vectors used for veterinary vaccines among its many advantages are the inability to replicate in mammalian cells its large coding capacity induction of low levels of vector immunity and its ability to overcome maternal antibodies huw hughes merial lyon france demonstrated that a registered alvac vector expressing the hemagglutinin ha of influenza virus ahorsekentucky94 or ahorsenewmarket293 protected horses from infection in addition antibody titers remained high for at least 1 year following the second vaccination also coronavirus vectors have been developed as was demonstrated by luis enjuanes centro nacional de biotecnologa csic madrid spain this single-stranded positive sense rna virus has no dna intermediate minimizing the risk of chromosomal integration by the vector in addition variation of the spike protein can control the tropism of the virus and target certain areas of the body finally reinfections with coronaviruses occur frequently suggesting that pre-existing immunity is easily overcome by the virus the construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the full-length transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev allowed genetic manipulation of the virus 24 it was shown that an e-protein deficient tgev virus can only replicate on packaging cell-lines expressing the e-protein 25 relocation of the packaging signal between the m and e genes a likely recombination site of e-protein deficient viruses to become propagation competent is leading to the production of highly safe coronavirus vectors 26 certain attenuated viruses can be used as vectors for antigen delivery of foreign viral antigens attenuation may be achieved by reduced replication capacity eg yf strain 17d and modified vaccinia ankara mva or be based on species restriction eg canarypox vector alvac these vectors can induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses specific for the protein of interest gerd sutter gsfinstitute of molecular virology muenchen germany elaborated on progress made with regard to the development of mva vector technologies mva can be used under conditions of biosafety level 1 because of its avirulence and its deficiency to productively grow in human cells in animal models mva vaccines have been found immunogenic and protective against various infectious agents including immunodeficiency viruses here data from a clinical trial were presented providing evidence for safety and immunogenicity of recombinant mva when used as therapeutic vaccine in hiv-infected individuals 27 finally it was shown that modification of immune regulatory genes such as interferon resistance genes or interleukin-inhibitor sequences conserved within the mva genome might provide the basis for the development of advanced second generation mva vaccines with even higher immunogenicity 28 29 another viral vector is semliki-forest virus sfv which has features of both the dna and the rna viral vectors for the induction of an immune response against a foreign antigen sfv replicons producing the foreign protein can be used for vaccination also naked rna or cdna of these replicons can be used for vaccination against foreign antigens 30 peter liljestrm karolinska institute stockholm sweden reported that the replicase protein of sfv plays an important role in the maturation of dendritic cells dc it was also shown that sfv is capable of inducing cross-priming and maturation of dc as well as interferon ifn- production providing enough danger signals to induce a vigorous immune response to foreign antigens explaining their good immunogenicity the potential to modulate hcv-specific immune responses using cytokines was tested by christine rollier biomedical primate research center rijswijk netherlands the addition of dna plasmids encoding for interleukin il-12 and il-2 did not enhance the immunogenicity of a candidate dna vaccine based on the ns3 protein of hcv in rhesus macaques jos melero using state of the art technology has identified the fusion properties and fusion sites of rsv fusion protein f-protein 31 future research will be aimed at the development of compounds or antibodies capable of binding to the fusogenic intermediate of the f-protein ideal vaccines should combine low reactogenicity with high immunogenicity profiles in order to be safe and efficacious unfortunately both characteristics often go hand in hand resulting in immunogenic but reactogenic vaccines therefore researchers have tried to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines by prime-boost regimens or by using adjuvants or alternative methods of vaccination guus rimmelzwaan erasmus mc rotterdam netherlands summarized the findings of three different studies conducted in three different species using iscoms containing the ha and neuraminidase na of various influenza viruses both monkeys and chickens were protected from infection with the h3n2 subtype and the highly pathogenic h5n1 subtype of influenza a virus respectively after vaccination with an iscom based but not after vaccination with a conventional sub-unit vaccine 32 33 the protection correlated with vigorous antibody and t-cell responses in humans who have pre-existing immunity to influenza virus the added value of the adjuvant was less pronounced however the kinetics of virus-specific antibody responses was accelerated in the iscom vaccinated individuals compared to those who received the conventional vaccine in addition the iscom vaccine induced ctl responses whereas the classical vaccine did not vaccines are often administered intramuscularly im while alternative administration methods may enhance the immunogenicity of certain vaccines lendon payne powderject vaccines inc wi usa demonstrated that the powderject can deliver dna and proteins to the epidermis which is known to contain a unique population of langerhans cells the epidermal powder immunization can also combine certain adjuvants like qs21 or e coli heat-labile enterotoxin lt with dna or sub-unit vaccines co-administration of lt induced strong cellular immune responses in mice 34 jan wilschut university of groningen groningen netherlands presented data on the use of virosomes as a possible carrier of influenza viral glycoproteins virosomes which are reconstituted viral envelopes without the viral genome have been shown to induce both humoral and cellular immunity in mice 35 in addition the virosomes are capable of harboring aliphatic adjuvants further enhancing their potential to induce immunity to viral glycoproteins finally anneke boonstra covaccine bv lelystad netherlands informed us about the latest developments in dissacharide fatty acid sulphate ester adjuvants 36 experiments demonstrated that one sulphate in combination with seven lauric acids s1l7 in squalane-in-water induced high levels of influenza virus-specific antibodies in both pigs and humans gary nabel national institute of health bethesda usa presented recent data on human immunodeficiency virus hiv candidate vaccine testing in monkeys inclusion of the envelop gene in the candidate vaccine plasmid dnarecombinant adenovirus prime-boost regiment enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses which correlated with immune protection 37 using high doses of plasmid dna 48 milligram hiv-specific t-cell responses were induced in a high percentage of individuals one of the mysteries of hiv is the transmission of ccr5-tropic viruses and not cxcr4-tropic viruses upon infection new data demonstrated that the ccr5-tropic viruses can infect immature dc whereas cxcr4-tropic viruses cannot these immature dc can upon maturation mediate viral transfer to cd4 t cells since this whole process is done within cells it is highly resistant to neutralizing antibody activity this mechanism may contribute to preferential transmission of ccr5-tropic viruses and may have implications for future vaccine design dna-prime adenovirus vector boost vaccine regiments currently seem the best method to induce high cd8 t-cell responses pre-existing antibodies to adenovirus however interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine jaap goudsmit crucell nv leiden netherlands has identified alternative adenovirus serotypes with low seroprevalence in the human population adenovirus serotype 35 ad35 was shown to have low global seroprevalence and low infection rates in both hiv positive and negative individuals which makes ad35 virus an attractive viral vector 38 duncan steele who geneva switzerland offered us the latest on rotavirus vaccine developments 39 40 rotavirus is an important pathogen of young children claiming half a million deaths each year in particular in developing countries rotavirus is a complex triple layered virus with two neutralizing antigens which are involved in the immune response of the host vaccine strategies differ in the need for the development of homo- and heterotypic immunity to these specific antigens currently two la rotavirus vaccines are licensed rotashield wyeth vaccines a tetravalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine demonstrated 70 protection against all rotavirus diarrhea and more than 90 against severe disease however 25 of the vaccinees developed fever upon vaccination and there was an elevated risk of developing intussusception in 110000 vaccinees for this reason rotashield as a vaccine has been withdrawn the second la rotavirus vaccine is manufactured in china although it efficacy in truly nave children remains to be demonstrated two candidate rotavirus vaccines are in late stages of development rotateq merck research and rotarix gsk biologicals the efficacy of both candidate vaccines is similar in early clinical trials approximately 70 effective in preventing rotavirus diarrhea to that of rotashield the future will reveal which of the two candidate vaccines ie a two dose rotarix or the three dose oral vaccination rotateq will provide better heterologous and long-term protection prior to clinical use of rotavirus candidate vaccines potential interference with live oral poliovirus vaccination and the safety immunogenicity and efficacy in hiv-infected children should be investigated the threats of emerging viral infections and terrorist attacks with biological weapons have triggered a major effort finding cures or vaccines against these agents james leduc pointed out some of the issues involved in candidate vaccines for emerging and rare diseases the difficulty with these rare viral diseases is the inability to demonstrate efficacy in humans should fda approval therefore be based on data obtained in 2050 monkeys whose predictive value regarding efficacy and safety remain controversial other issues involved are fast tracking of these vaccines by the regulatory authorities covering international property rights liability issues and different viewpoints of government and industry including willingness and justifiability to develop certain vaccines gary nabel presented data on ebola virus vaccine development the glycoprotein gp of ebola virus causes cell rounding and detachment of human endothelial and epithelial cells these effects require the presence of the mucin-like domain of gp and correspond with the down-regulation of v-integrin on the cell surface the gp is an important vaccine candidate however passive transfer of antibodies in both humans and monkeys did not confer protection from infection vaccination experiments are therefore aiming at the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses to ebola virus surprisingly monkeys vaccinated once with an adenoviral vector encoding for the gp and np of ebola virus were protected from a high dose challenge 41 in 2001 the us government had decided that every citizen should be able to receive a smallpox vaccination the original dryvax vaccine consisted of heterogeneous virion subpopulations and may have been contaminated with ruminant viruses richard weltzin acambis inc ma usa presented data on the plaque purification of the original virus stock yielding the acam2000 isolate which proved to be immunogenic without neurovirulence in mice and monkeys 42 currently this virus is being tested in phase i and ii trials smallpox vaccination by scarification with vaccinia virus is a crude method which is not quantitative and requires skilled personnel it also results in an active local lesion and shedding of live virus other methods of vaccination may be more quantitative and do not shed live virus amanda phelps biomedical sciences porton down uk showed that intramuscular vaccination of mice provided better protection at lower vaccine doses than needle-free microject or scarification methods severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is an important emerging infectious disease caused by sars-cov for which currently no cure or vaccine exists in mice it was shown that dna encoding the spike protein of sars-cov induced spike protein-specific antibodies these antibodies and antiserum from a recovered patient were shown by gary nabel to inhibit gene transfer by a pseudotype virus containing the spike protein of sars-cov in addition kirill kalnin acambis inc ma usa demonstrated that hyper immune serum from sars-cov infected individuals reacted with the recombinant spike protein these data suggest that the spike protein of sars-cov may be a good vaccine candidate the viral vaccine meeting ended with a series of presentations about the emergence of sars-cov on february 14th the who reported the first cases of sars-cov between the 21st and 26th of march a new coronavirus sars-cov was identified by three laboratories 43 44 two weeks later the entire genome of the virus was sequenced 45 closely followed by the fulfillment of kochs postulates 46 other important hallmarks for sars-cov were the identification of the virus in several animal species including the palm civets albert osterhaus showed the ability of sars-cov to infect macaques 46 and different carnivore species including the house-cat and the ferret 47 at the end of the epidemic several important conclusions could be drawn among the risk factors for adverse outcome of the disease were age 60 years diabetes heart disease and other co-morbid conditions early during the epidemic it was noted that health-care workers were at risk for contracting disease this may have been due to the relatively late peak in virus-titers day 1016 after onset of illness subjecting these health care workers with high doses of virus the relatively late peak in virus titers has also hampered the diagnosis of sars-cov malik peiris queens mary hospital hong kong sar showed that improved rna extraction and real-time pcr increase the percentage positive swabs considerably 63 positive on day 1 and 88 on day 23 48 to prepare for a second introduction of sars-cov into the human population antiviral drugs and protective vaccines are urgently needed luis enjuanes was the first to clone the full-length genome of a coronavirus tgev the deletion of the e protein and relocation of the packaging signal has generated a safe and efficacious vaccine candidate a full-length sars-cov genomic clone 49 may augment the generation of candidate sars-cov vaccines the meeting was ended with a presentation by jan hendriks public health directorate european commission luxembourg who on behalf of the european commission highlighted the opportunities and stumble blocks for the

world health organization who rd blueprint regulatory preparedness for public health emergencies phes was on the agenda of the 17th international conference of drug regulatory authorities icdra meeting in 2016 a number of regulatory gaps were identified and icdra recommended who should ensure that regulatory support is a priority area of activity as the rd blueprint for emerging infectious diseases is implemented1 it was also requested who should continue developing measurement and written standards that serve as a basis for regulatory evaluation taking into consideration 1 priority pathogens defined by the blueprint and 2 a more flexible and dynamic approach to developing and establishing standards for quality safety and efficacy of products for use in phes2 in response to the request who convened an informal consultation in february 2018 to initiate the work to revise the guidelines for assuring the quality and nonclinical safety evaluation of dna vaccines annex 1 who technical report series no 941 adopted by the 2005 ecbs3 based on the agreement in the informal consultation in february 2018 the first revised draft was prepared by a drafting group and posted on who biologicals website for the first round of public consultation httpswwwwhointbiologicalswhodnavaccinehk26july2019pdf the consultation in december 2019 aimed to discuss and obtain advice on the first

paul-ehrlich-institut germany was nominated as chairperson and dr rebecca sheets who consultant usa as rapporteur for the consultation dr ivana knezevic who hq switzerland welcomed all the participants to geneva and briefed the participants on the activities of who in the area of biological standardization she explained that who is the directing and coordinating authority for health on behalf of the 194 member countries in the united nations system in order to fulfill who objectives a core who function defined as setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation has been conducted for 70 years this initiative includes assisting national regulatory authorities nras in the utilization of who biological reference materials and application of the principles in who guidelines and recommendations to ensure quality safety and efficacy of vaccines and other biologicals the world of immunization is a rapidly evolving field and is constantly changing the picture of morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases in that context vaccines are playing a critical role in disease prevention and access to vaccines of assured quality is one of the goals of the who at the same time the use of new technologies for manufacturing as well as new antigens adjuvants and routes of administration are imposing lots of challenges not only to regulators but also to public health professionals in addition the response to phes such as ebola and zika outbreaks triggered development of a number of vaccine candidates based on nucleic acid platforms clinical trials with these candidates for different diseases are either ongoing or planned in the near future post meeting note at the time of the submission of this paper for publication more than ten vaccine candidates against the coronavirus disease covid-19 based on nucleic acids are being developed who is monitoring vaccines under development continuously and provides regular updates on it httpswwwwhointblueprintpriority-diseaseskey-actionnovel-coronavirusen this is increasing the importance of the revision and update of who guidelines for evaluation of dna vaccines in

httpswwwwhointvaccinesafetycommitteereportsjun2019en of importance to the report herein are their priorities on research and innovation and on fragility and emergencies dr knezevic emphasized the importance of the present consultation that is the last step in terms of the face-to-face consultation on evaluating quality safety and efficacy of dna vaccines involving regulators manufacturers and other experts in this field representatives of several collaborating centers for biological standardization are also part of the consultation as well as representatives of other institutions that are playing an important role in this field dr hye-na kang who hq switzerland provided the background to the development of the guidelines and to the organization of this consultation she reviewed the recommendations from the 17th meeting of icdra1 and the procedure of drafting guidelines by the who drafting group that consisted of drs margaret a liu heidi meyer edwin nkansah keith peden rebecca sheets and who secretariat hye-na kang in response to the request of the icdra a drafting group prepared the first draft of document and released it for public consultation after a series of teleconferences httpswwwwhointbiologicalswhodnavaccinehk26july2019pdf the objective of the informal consultation december 2019 was to reach a consensus on the regulatory principles of the draft guidelines discuss and identify any pending or critical issues such that an improved second draft can be prepared for the final round of public consultation and adoption by the who ecbs in october 2020 several researchers in the field of plasmid dna vaccines presented data on the current status of their development there continues to be great interest by international groups on the promise of plasmid dna vaccines as a platform technology for the rapid and facile development of vaccines to prevent outbreaks and pandemics dr david kaslow path usa representing the who product development for vaccines advisory committee pdvac reviewed the advantages of dna vaccines as a platform technology and how they fit into the objectives and goals of the pdvac he pointed out that the guideline revision may need to reflect the potential different purposes of a dna vaccineie the use for routine immunization vs the use for an outbreak setting it will be important that dna vaccines become available for the purposes of routine immunization if they are to be truly available in the case of outbreak response he also raised some potential issues surrounding the need for a specific device for vaccine delivery especially in the outbreak setting when the supply may be limited and the cost-of-goods may not be favorable in preparation for such situations current device designs should be adapted for ease of use and deployment in the setting of low- and middle-income countries lmics as well as meet who programmatic suitability criteria for routine use dr kaslow also raised the issue of the need for more information on developmental toxicology for dna vaccines to support their use in the setting of maternal immunization including in breast-feeding women these data are needed to pave the way for outbreak responses as pregnant women often belong to the group at highest risk for serious complications dr nick jackson coalition for epidemic preparedness and innovation cepi norway explained the role of the cepi and their interest in plasmid dna vaccines as a platform technology to achieve their mission they target certain pathogens in their funding program including lassa virus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov nipah virus rift valley fever virus chikungunya virus and disease x a hypothetical template for an emerging disease of the future a mers-cov plasmid dna vaccine candidate has advanced into phase 1 clinical trials with promising results they plan to initiate a phase 2 study in mid-2020 a lassa virus candidate vaccine has also advanced into a phase 1 clinical trial dr ami patel the wistar institute usa discussed many advantages of plasmid dna vaccines and gave an update on a therapeutic human papilloma virus vaccine candidate delivered in conjunction with an electroporation device this vaccine candidate has also completed phase 2b pilot efficacy testing against cervical cancer with very interesting results of 4045 impact on endpoints such as regression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia cin 23 to cin 1 regression to normal and clearance of evidence of infection4 a phase 3 study of this candidate opened in 2017 this candidate is also being studied in head and neck cancer5 her team is also involved in development of ebola mers-cov and zika plasmid dna vaccine candidates in the case of zika her team was able to advance to the clinic with the candidate plasmid dna vaccine rapidly 7 months largely because of not needing to repeat nonclinical toxicology studies on their platform technology6 instead decisions were made on the basis of existing nonclinical and clinical data for the platform which predict safe starting doses and dose regimens as well as expected reactogenicity for the platform finally she presented her work on expressing monoclonal antibodies mab in the plasmid dna system their anti-zika candidate mab has advanced to the clinic as well an update was given by dr julie ledgerwood nih usa on a plasmid dna vaccine candidate that had proceeded as far as an international phase 2b pilot efficacy study against zika virus while safety was demonstrated the changing epidemiology in the face of a waning epidemic meant that too few cases of zika were seen to evaluate efficacy however samples are still being analyzed and further cases may yet be identified importantly because of their platform and earlier nonclinical and clinical work on a west nile virus plasmid dna vaccine candidate their zika vaccine candidate was able to proceed to phase 1 in 325 months in large measure because additional nonclinical toxicology studies were not required abbreviating not only the nonclinical program but the overall time-to-clinic as with dr patels teams vaccine candidate decisions were based on the existing database of nonclinical and clinical experience with the platform early entry into phase 1 permitted advancement to phase 2b even as the outbreak was ongoing unfortunately this was still not rapid enough to capture sufficient efficacy data to support near-term licensure of the vaccine candidate7 she also presented data on studies performed earlier by her institute in which plasmid dna vaccine candidates for ebola and marburg were among the first plasmid dna vaccines tested in africa demonstrating feasibility of testing these vaccines delivered by devices other than needle-and-syringe in lmic settings8 plasmid dna vaccines may be viewed as a platform technology in which only the antigen gene has been changed from one vaccine to another based on the same dna plasmid backbone for a given manufacturer the manufacturing and controls may vary little between plasmid dna vaccines they manufacture control measures are likely highly similar even between manufacturers therefore the guidelines on plasmid dna vaccines though not specific to a particular vaccine can be written so as to be generally applicable with part a the quality section of the guidelines in addition although part b nonclinical and part c clinical sections will be consistent with the general guidelines on these topics there are a few additional topic areas of relevance to plasmid dna vaccines discussed in these guidelines911 many of the concerns that harken back to the beginnings of use of plasmid dna vaccines two decades ago have been deleted from the guidelines as nonclinical and clinical evidence from various vaccine candidates over the intervening time have alleviated those concerns the current generation of dna vaccines made from bacteria are produced biologically and are considered to be a biological product while the plasmid is generated by recombinant dna technology it should be clarified that a plasmid dna vaccine itself is not an organism thus it is not a genetically modified organism per se nor is it a gene-transfer or gene-therapy product as it is not expected to persist and permanently mark the recipient there is a wealth of evidence that dna vaccines to date do not persist or even biodistribute throughout the body of the vaccine when delivered parenterally into muscle subcutaneous tissue or various dermal layers in addition development of plasmid dna vaccines for routine use may lead to rapid and ready implementation of new vaccines for emerging diseases even in the face of an emergency setting once the platform technology is proven safe and efficacious for one or more diseases a novel vaccine candidate based on the same technology but replacing only the antigen encoded to match the emerging disease could permit rapid manufacturing reduced abbreviated or waived requirements for nonclinical toxicology and rapid entry into clinical testing rapid entry into the clinic has already been shown with two plasmid dna vaccine candidates against zika described above thus proof-of-concept has precedent this session was dedicated to reviewing the draft guidelines in response to the public consultation the discussion was led by dr rebecca sheets providing a summary of comments received from the first round of public consultation and main issues to be discussed at this meeting most of these comments were accepted and the changes made rejected comments were few such as a suggestion to follow the ich structure rather than the who standard however three topics remained for discussion by the consultants at the meeting the first of these was surrounding several comments received on the discussion of potency assessment of multi-plasmid-containing vaccines the second topic was about the appendix on heterologous prime-boost included in the current draft document several comments were made to delete the appendix as the information was included in the body of the guideline the third topic was on a comment given to put more emphasis on the delivery device discussion the discussion on potency of multi-plasmid-containing vaccines led to a decision to clarify the discussion in the guideline for the rationale why this might need to be done at the individual bulk stage instead of in the final product however this discussion led to a more important and in-depth look at how potency is being assessed currently most vaccine candidates are moving forward into the clinical development without a bioassay but simply measuring content quantitythe basis for dosing and percent supercoiled form of plasmid a quality measure that should correlate with potency in vivo this led to the discussion of revisions to the potency section itself the appendix on heterologous prime-boost was agreed to be deleted the discussion on the delivery device led to agreement that the information already in the general principles was mostly adequate but that further emphasis on the labeling of what some jurisdictions might consider to be a combination product it was also agreed that further discussion about the device in part c clinical would add further clarity to the guidelines during the consultation several suggestions for amendment of the current draft document were made in order to reaffirm clarify and provide further guidance on specific issues these are summarized in table 1 further information on

failure were seen in the er and then admitted to icu facilities for further treatment 1 the causative pathogen was later identified as a novel coronavirus named as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by world health organization who or sars-cov-2 by the coronavirus study group csg of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv on february 12 2020 or human coronavirus 19 hcov-19 by a group of virologists in china 2 the who announced coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 as the official name of the disease respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission and human-to-human transmission had been occurring among close contacts since the middle of december 2019 3 who declared covid-19 as pandemic on march 11 2020 as of april 22 2020 a total of 2475723 cases had been confirmed globally with 169151 deaths httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019 coronaviruses which are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses belong to the family coronaviridae they are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals 4 previously six coronavirus species were known to cause human disease including hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 5 the first four species caused only mild symptoms but sars-cov and mers-cov have caused more than 10 thousand cumulative infections in humans in the past two decades with mortality rates of 10 for sars-cov and 34 for mers-cov respectively 6 7 8 sars-cov-2 is the seventh number of the family of coronavirus that can infect humans 9 although the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 is lower than that of mers-cov and sars-cov its transmissibility median r0 57 is much higher than that of either mers-cov r0 1 or sars-cov r0 3 10 genome sequencing analysis of clinically isolated samples from patients showed that sars-cov-2 shares 88 nucleotide similarity with two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 but has only around 79 and 50 identity with sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 11 the genome of sars-cov-2 and other emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses encodes four major structural proteins including spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n as well as sixteen nonstructural proteins nsp1-16 plus five to eight accessory proteins 12 among them sars-cov-2 uses s protein to bind its host cell membrane receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 for virus entry fig 1
 and subsequent pathogenesis 13 phylogenetic analysis suggested that bats might be the primary reservoir for sars-cov-2 14 while the intermediate host is still under investigation the rapid worldwide expansion of sars-cov-2 calls for smart poct diagnostic approaches safe and effective vaccines as well as novel therapeutics to detect prevent and cure covid-19 infection here we highlight the safety and effectiveness of vaccines with respect to dr shibo jiangs recent appeal that safety be foremost on the minds of vaccine developers as they begin to engage in preclinical and clinical trials to tackle sars-cov-2 15 here we briefly summarize current diagnostic approaches and development of vaccines and therapeutics for sars-cov-2 those infected with sars-cov-2 may present with such symptoms as fever dry cough fatigue or shortness of breath with or without nasal congestion runny nose or other respiratory symptoms 1 however patients with mild symptoms may not present any positive signs thus rapid and accurate detection of the causative pathogen is essential in controlling the outbreak among both asymptomatic carriers and individuals showing signs of the disease however since sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered virus the diagnostic toolkit is limited up to now sars-cov-2 has been detected from clinical specimens analyzed by electron microscopy cell culture real-time reverse-transcription pcr rt-pcr and next-generation sequencing 9 molecular tests for rapid detection of the causative virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients meanwhile rt-pcr which combines the reverse transcription of rna and amplification of specific cdna regions remains the primary means of diagnosing sars-cov-2 16 normally sputum lower respiratory tract secretions blood urine or stool samples are collected form suspected patients nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended upper respiratory tract specimen types for sars-cov-2 detection 17 the university of hong kong-shenzhen hospital enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to wuhan from shenzhen between december 29 2019 and january 4 2020 nasopharyngeal or throat swabs were collected after rna extraction an rt-pcr assay was performed to amplify the genes encoding the internal rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and the surface spike s protein of sars-cov-2 phylogenetic analysis of the rt-pcr amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing confirmed that the family was indeed infected by sars-cov-2 18 prof poons group developed two 1-step quantitative rt-pcr assays to detect the orf1b and n genes of sars-cov-2 the assays were evaluated using a panel of positive rna extracted from cells infected by sars coronavirus and negative controls the detection limits were found to be below 10 copies per reaction and samples from two sars-cov-2 infected patients were positive in the tests 19 samples from all collections contained sputum as well as nose and throat swabs with or without viral transport medium rna extraction and rt-pcr were performed to amplify the rdrp e and n genes of sars-cov-2 the assays were highly sensitive and specific because they did not cross-react with other coronaviruses 20 collection of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens may cause discomfort and bleeding especially in patients with thrombocytopenia 18 this method also requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients which poses a risk of transmission 17 consequently neither nasopharyngeal nor oropharyngeal specimens are ideal for serial monitoring of viral load one study used saliva to screen respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without fever or respiratory symptoms 21 prof yuens group collected saliva from 12 hong kong patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and the novel coronavirus could be detected in the saliva specimens of 11 patients 917 by in-house one-step real time rt-qpcr assay targeting the s gene 17 suggesting that saliva could be a practical noninvasive specimen type several rapid diagnostic kits for sars-cov-2 detection are now commercially available among them one is from the beijing genome institute bgi it can detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies and it has been approved for clinical use 16 several major biotechnology companies have advanced nucleic acid platforms for covid-19 vaccine development the innovation and value initiative ivi inovio and the korea national institute of health knih are collaborating with the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi to test the safety and immunogenicity of a dna vaccine named ino-4800 in phase 12 clinical trial in south korea 24 both modernanih and curevac are focusing on mrna vaccine development and a safety clinical trial of modernas candidate vaccine mrna-1273 with a sample size of 45 volunteers was performed in march 2020 25 subunit vaccines based on recombinant s or s1 protein of sars-cov and mers-cov have been demonstrated to be efficacious in many studies 26 27 28 29 clover biopharmaceuticals is developing a vaccine consisting of a trimerized sars-cov-2 s protein using their patented trimer-tag technology 30 the receptor-binding domain rbd in sars-cov-2 s protein was identified and it was further demonstrated that sars-cov-2 rbd exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ace2 receptor compared to binding between sars-cov rbd and ace2 31 suggesting that the rbd-based sars-cov vaccines have the potential to be developed for prevention of sars-cov-2 infections rbd-based vaccines are now under development by several organizations through international collaborations 32 the pulmonary surfactant-biomimetic nanoparticles used to potentiate heterosubtypic influenza immunity can be used as adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of sars-cov-2 subunit vaccines 33 whole inactivated or live-attenuated virus vaccines represent a traditional vaccine strategy researchers at the university of hong kong have developed a live influenza vaccine that expresses sars-cov-2 proteins 34 codagenix has developed a codon deoptimization technology to attenuate viruses and the company is exploring covid-19 vaccine strategies 35 vaccines based on viral vectors offer a high level of protein expression and long-term stability and induce strong immune responses 36 johnson  johnson is developing an adenovirus-vectored vaccine using advacperc6 vaccine platforms 37 the first covid-19 vaccine candidate based on adenovirus-vectored vaccine developed by chen wei group entered human clinical testing nct04313127 with unprecedented rapidity early on 16 march 2020 another phase i safety trial of a recombinant adenovirus vaccine candidate cansino biologics inc tianjin china ad5-ncov recruited 108 healthy adults in wuhan china in march 2020 38 apart from adenovirus vector-based vaccine two lentivirus vector-based vaccine candidates covid-19aapc and lv-smenp-dc have been developed by shenzhen geno-immune medical institute the covid-19aapc vaccine was developed by applying lentivirus modification including the sars-cov-2 minigenes and immune modulatory genes to the artificial antigen presenting cells aapcs the phase i clinical trial consisting of 100 participants started on february 15 2020 and the estimated study completion date was december 31 2024 nct04299724 the lv-smenp dc vaccine was developed by modifying dc with lentivirus vectors expressing sars-cov-2 minigene smenp and immune modulatory genes the phase i clinical trial involving 100 patients was conducted on march 24 2020 and the estimated study completion date was also december 31 2024 nct04276896 httpclinicaltrialsgov as we all know that adjuvants play a critical role by enhancing immunogenicity of the vaccine candidates and make dose viable in some vaccine platforms so far there are at least 10 developers have engaged into developing adjuvanted covid-19 vaccines vaccine developers dynavax seqirus and glaxosmithkline have committed to making some liscensed adjuvants including mf59 as03 and cpg 1018 available for use 36 no matter which platform we take to develop the covid-19 vaccines researchers need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the candidate vaccine at each step in this situation sars-cov-2 specific animal models seems quite essential until now some different animal models are under developed including hamsters ferrets ace2-transgenic mice and non-human primates 36 specific drugs to treat the novel coronavirus will probably take several years to develop and evaluate however a range of existing host-directed therapies are under investigation for example clinical trials with protease inhibitors clinical trialsgov nct04276688 nct04255017 and so on and nucleotide analog remdesivir clinical trialsgov nct04280705 nct04257656 nct04252664 and so on are ongoing in china and the united states 39 lopinavir and ritonavir two licensed hiv protease inhibitors have been tested in combination for efficacy in 99 covid-19 patients in china but the results suggested no difference in the clinical outcome when compared with standard care 40 still one 54-year-old male the third patient diagnosed with covid-19 infection in korea did show a significant decrease in viral load after lopinavirritonavir administration and no virus titer was observed 41 the preliminary results of a clinical trial on favipiravir for the treatment of covid-19 with a total of 80 patients showed that favipiravir had more potent antiviral action than that of lopinavirritonavir 42 future trials on patients with severe covid-19 may help to confirm or exclude the efficacy of lopinavirritonavir treatment remdesivir the antiviral agent was designed for the ebola virus infection and it was shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several rna viruses 43 remdesivir was shown to be highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 44 it was used to treat the first case of covid-19 infection in the united states and the patients clinical condition improved after only one day 45 indicating the promise of remdesivir an anti-sars-cov-2 drug several clinical trials are ongoing it has been demonstrated that sars-cov-2 uses the same cell entry receptor ace2 as sars-cov 13 the use of recombinant ace2 race2 to neutralize the virus clinical trialsgov nct04287686 is now under clinical investigation 39 in vitro studies have demonstrated that vero cells pretreated with chloroquine are refractory to sars-cov infection by interruption of the glycosylation process 46 chloroquine has been demonstrated to be highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 44 accordingly chloroquine was first tested in clinical trial by chinese investigators on more than 100 patients with covid-19 and it showed a reduction in the duration of symptoms and exacerbation of pneumonia along with radiological improvement leading to virus-negative seroconversion 47 hydroxychloroquine a less toxic derivative of chloroquine was shown to be effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 48 however no confirmed results from a normalized clinical trial clihydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin was tested by french investigators on patients with covid-19 and it showed that 100 patients with covid-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin exhibited virological cure on day 6 of the treatment however only 571 of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone have exhibited virologocal cure 49 however its use for treatment of covid-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial was against by the us fda due to risk of heart rhythm problems httpswwwfdagovdrugsdrug-safety-and-availabilityfda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or another interesting strategy is to use convalescent plasma cp as treatment but it should be noted that cp should be collected within two weeks after recovery to ensure a high neutralization antibody titer 50 it was reported that sars-cov-2 isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a severe patient could be neutralized by sera from several other patients 51 another preliminary uncontrolled case involved 5 patients with severe covid-19 after they were administered cp containing neutralizing antibodies nab their clinical status improved 52 one dose of 200 ml of cp with the nab titers above 1640 was transfused to 10 patients with severe covid-19 as an addition to maximal supportive care and administration of antiviral agents the clinical symptoms were significantly improved within 3 days and several parameters were improved compared to pretransfusion including decreased c-reactive protein and increased lymphocyte counts 53 presently 36 clinical trials are ongoing worldwide httpclinicaltrialsgov previous research on mers-cov- and sars-cov-specific nabs may provide valuable guidelines for rapid design and development of sars-cov-2-specific nabs among the structural proteins of sars-cov-2 s fragments such as s1-ntd rbd and s2 can be considered as targets for nab development 12 polycloncal human immunoglobulin g igg derived from transgenic cows has been tested successfully for mers-cov in animal models 54 and this strategy has been tested for safety in clinical trials clinical trialsgov nct02788188 because of the high identity of the rbd in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the cross-reactivity of sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibodies was tested on sars-cov-2 and it was found that only cr3022 bound potently with sars-cov-2 55 indicating that cr3022 might be a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of covid-19 infections cocktails consisting of antibodies specific for rbd and other regions in the s protein can be considered to further improve the breadth and efficacy of nabs against sars-cov-2 infection 12 studies have also revealed that some coronavirus entry inhibitors have potential to be developed for treatment or prevention of sars-cov-2 infection the peptides derived from the hr2 domain of the spike proteins of sars-cov 56 mers-cov 6 and sars-cov-2 57 58 have been shown to be effective against the fusion entry and replication of the corresponding coronavirus a pan-corovirus fusion inhibitor ek1 were reported to be highly effective against divergent human coronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov hcov-oc43 hcov-229e hcov-nl-63 and sars-cov-2 as well as several bat sars-related coronaviruses sarsr-covs 58 59 a series of lipopeptides derived from ek1 which targeted the hr1 domain were highly potent in inhibiting entry and infection of divergent human coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 for example the lipopeptide ek1c4 inhibited sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated membrane fusion with ic50 of 13 nm 57 therefore these peptides have great potential to be further developed as a therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of the current sars-cov-2 and mers-cov infection and future emerging and reemerging coronavirus infections researchers announced that darunavir which is a second-generation hiv-1 protease inhibitor inhibited sars-cov-2 infection in vitro and that the inhibition efficiency was 280-fold over that of the untreated group 42 another trial nct04304053 is looking at the efficacy of a durunavircobicistat plus choroquine treatment 60 chinese herbal medicines such as radix sophorae and rhizoma polygoni cuspidati may contain agents against sars-cov-2 42 the combination of traditional chinese and western medicine treatments is also promising nonetheless the efficacy and safety of all these potential candidates in the treatment of covid-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials however development of safe and effective covid-19 therapeutics is often hampered by the lack of valid covid-19 animal models for evaluation their in vivo safety and efficacy 61 here we reviewed recently published information about diagnostic approaches as well as vaccine and treatment development for sars-cov-2 quickly identifying a person with sars-cov-2 infection is critical to control the continuing spread of the virus the noninvasive specimen collection strategy has the advantage when collecting clinical specimens it cannot be overstated that both vaccine development and investigation into potential drugs are subject to further studies to validate safety and efficacy including for example immunization strategies adjuvant selection or establishment of animal models international collaborations or consortia will promote covid-19 and move vaccine development forward safety evaluation of candidate vaccines against sars-cov-2 is paramount and this issue is related to the type of vaccines to be selected and immunogens to be designed potential therapeutics include lopinavirritonavir remdesivir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine cp and polyclonalmonoclonal antibodies again however clinical trials are needed for further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in treating covid-19 the authors declare no conflicts of interest  recombinant live vaccines to protect against the severe acute respiratory

has been declared as a category c priority pathogen by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases biodefense httpwwwniaidnihgovbiodefensebandcpriorityhtml a defined efficacious therapy is not yet available for sars and the possibility of a reemergence of the virus due to the presence of a high number of bats in different continents infected with sars-cov ancestors is a realistic one therefore the design of an effective and safe vaccine to protect against sars is still high priority vaccines based on whole purified inactivated virus have the benefit of presenting a complete repertoire of viral antigens although inactivated vaccines do not in general provide longlasting immunity these vaccines provide good protection in mice 24 hamster 25 and partial protection in ferrets 25 26 in rhesus monkeys a formaldehyde-inactivated sars-cov vaccine showed partial protection 27 28 an inactivated sars-cov vaccine was also administered to humans this vaccine was safe and induced neutralizing antibodies but no efficacy data have been reported 29 overall inactivated vaccines based on whole purified virus induced neutralizing antibodies were apparently safe at least in young animal models and provided good protection subunit vaccines have the advantage of their simplicity chemical definition and lack of potential variability 30 in the case of sars-cov a great advantage is that well-defined s protein domains binding the cell receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme hace2 have provided full immune protection 3134 this concept is reinforced by the observation that monoclonal antibodies specific for the receptor binding domain elicited protection in several animal models including african green monkeys 3541 in addition to s proteinderived domains or peptides protein 3a a large protein of sars-cov exposed on its envelope also elicits virus neutralizing antibodies 42 and could be useful in improving subunit vaccines furthermore immunity to sars-cov has also been demonstrated with virus-like particles vlp 43 overall the results obtained with subunit vaccines strongly suggest that protection against sars by vaccination is feasible dna vaccines are safe and nonexpensive but often are not very efficient in large mammals dna vaccines induce sars-cov neutralizing antibodies and protection in mice 4447 the use of viral vectors to protect against sars has been extensively explored adenovirus induced good protection in mice 25 modified vaccinia ankara mva provides protection in mice 35 and ferrets 48 although induction of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease aded was reported adeno-associated virus induces long-term protection against sars-cov 34 parainfluenza virus elicits protection in hamsters and monkeys 49 50 recombinant measles viruses expressing the s protein of sars-cov induces neutralizing antibodies and immune responses against sars-cov 51 newcastle disease recombinant virus expressing the s protein of sars-cov induces neutralizing antibodies in african green monkeys immunized via the respiratory tract 52 a recombinant attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus vsv protects mice against sars-cov challenge 4 months after vaccination 53 54 venezuelan equine encephalitis vee virus expressing the s protein of sars-cov induces protection against challenge with virulent virus in the mouse model 20 overall these results indicate that there is a very good prospect for the development of an efficacious and safe vaccine to prevent sars nevertheless there are relevant aspects that need to be improved in order to achieve a vaccine that can be fully protective and free of side effects both in young and in elderly people sars-cov is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus with a genome of 297 kb that belongs to genus  of the coronaviridae 5557 fig 1a the replicase gene is encoded within the 5 two-thirds of the sars-cov genome including two overlapping open reading frames orf named orfs 1a and 1b the latter is translated by a ribosomal frameshift upstream of the orf 1a stop codon 58 59 fig 1b translation of both orfs in the cytoplasm of infected cells results in the synthesis of two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that are processed by two viral proteinases to yield 16 functional nonstructural proteins nsps 60 61 these nsps are the components of the membrane-anchored replicationtranscription complex 62 all covs encode species-specific accessory genes in their downstream orfs with a remarkably conserved order replicasetranscriptase spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n the lipid bilayer envelope contains at least three proteins e and m that coordinate virion assembly and release and the large peplomer s fig 1a this glycoprotein is located on the virion surface conferring the virus characteristic corona shape s is the main mediator of host cell attachment and entry sars-cov orfs 3a 6 7a and 7b encode additional virus membrane proteins 6367 other accessory proteins are 8a 8b and 9b the functions for most of the accessory proteins are still unclear however it is known that some of these proteins influence virushost interaction and viral pathogenesis 6870
 for sars-cov hace2 molecule serves as a receptor 71 cd209l has also been implicated as an alternative receptor in entry 72 the e gene was nonessential for the genus  mhv cov 92 although elimination of this gene from the mhv genome reduced virus growth in cell culture more than 1000-fold in contrast for the group 1 tgev coronavirus expression of the e gene product was essential for virus release and spread propagation of e genedeleted tgev tgev-e was restored by providing e protein in trans 93 94 a recombinant sars-cov rsars-cov that lacks the e gene generated from a bac fig 2b was recovered in vero e6 cells with a relatively high titer around 106 pfuml and also from huh-7 and caco-2 cells with low titers indicating that sars-cov e protein is not essential for virus replication in cell culture 79 electron microscopy observation of vero e6 cells infected with the sars-cov wt or the e deletion mutant showed a higher efficiency of assembly and release for the wt virus fig 3 in this respect sars-cov-e behaves like mhv although sars-cov-e grows to a considerably higher titer vaccine viability and efficacy require the production of viruses with high titers interestingly adaptation of the rsars-cov-e virus to grow in vero cells after 16 passages led to an increase of virus titers reaching values almost identical to those displayed by the full-length virus around 107 pfuml 87 this titer is close to those required for a competitive live attenuated vaccine
 while sars-cov infects and replicates in several species including mice ferrets hamsters and nonhuman primates most of these animals only develop inapparent or mild disease 95 an ideal animal model that completely reproduces human clinical disease and pathological findings has not been identified to evaluate the rsars-cov-e vaccine candidate we have used three animal model systems hamster transgenic mice expressing the hace2 receptor for human sars-cov and conventional mice challenged with the mouse-adapted virus 22 23 79 8587 9698 these animal model systems are complementary the hamster model has been used to study sars-cov-e virus pathogenicity because it demonstrates elements present in human cases of sars-cov infections including interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation 79 96 97 the hamster model reproducibly supports sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract to a higher titer and for a longer duration than in mice or nonhuman primates virus replication in this model is accompanied by histological evidence of pneumonitis and the animals develop viremia and extrapulmonary spread of virus 96 although overt clinical disease is absent the hamster model is a useful model for the evaluation of sars-cov infection titers of recombinant sars-cov rsars-cov achieved in the respiratory tract of hamsters were similar to those previously reported for the wild-type virus 96 and were at least 100-fold higher than titers of the rsars-cov-e virus suggesting that this mutant virus is attenuated histopathological examination of lungs from infected hamsters showed reduced amounts of viral antigen and pulmonary inflammation in rsars-cov-e infected than in rsars-cov infected animals indicating that rsars-cov-e is attenuated in vivo 79 in fact reduction of sars-cov titers in patients has been associated with a considerable reduction in pathogenicity and increase in survival rates 99 100 rsars-cov-e immunized hamsters remained active following wild-type virus challenge while mock immunized displayed decreased activity 86 the transgenic mice model is based on the production of mice expressing the hace2 the receptor for human sars-cov transgenic mice models have been obtained in different laboratories by expressing the hace2 under the control of different promoters 98 101 these mice develop moderate respiratory disease but overwhelming neurological disease with 100 mortality after intranasal infection with sars-cov as such they are very useful to assess attenuation and vaccine safety and efficacy we previously showed that infection of these highly susceptible mice with rsars-cov-e or rsars-cov with e and several group-specific protein genes 6 7a 7b 8a 8b and 9b deleted rsars-cov-e69b resulted in neither weight loss nor death even after inoculation with very high virus doses 85 the mouse-adapted sars-cov model used in the evaluation of the rsars-cov-e and rsars-cov-e69b was based on the recent isolation of a sars-cov adapted to growth in mice or rats 22 102 103 this model provided a useful system for vaccine evaluation because some strains of mice and rats infected with these viruses develop severe respiratory disease and even death a mouse-adapted strain was isolated after 15 passages through the lungs of balbc mice ma15 strain and unlike the parental urbani strain of virus intranasal inoculation with this virus results in signs of respiratory disease with substantial mortality 22 we showed that immunization with rsars-cov-e or sars-cov-e69b almost completely protected balbc mice from fatal respiratory disease caused by mouse-adapted sars-cov fig 4 and partly protected hace2 transgenic mice from lethal disease 87
 in summary the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of rsars-cov-e has been shown in the three animal model systems described above hamsters highly susceptible transgenic mice expressing the hace2 receptor for human sars-cov and conventional mice challenged with the ma15 virus interestingly both homologous and heterologous protection was observed in fact hamsters and hace2 transgenic mice immunized with rsars-cov-e developed high serum neutralizing antibody titers and were protected from replication of homologous sars-cov urbani and heterologous sars-cov gd03 in the upper and lower respiratory tract 86 87 the relevance of this observation is that the gd03 strain of sars-cov is one of the serologically most divergent human sars-cov identified in relation to the urbani strain in addition it has been shown that the gd03 strain is closely related to the isolates obtained from animals and if sars-cov were to reemerge it would probably have an animal origin despite being attenuated in replication in the respiratory tract rsars-cov-e virus is an immunogenic and efficacious vaccine in hamsters and two mouse models e gene deletion mutants sars-cov-e and sars-cov-e69b were attenuated in two animal model systems hamster and transgenic mice expressing the ace-2 receptor as indicated above in fact infection with both deletion mutants led to no weight loss death or lung immune histopathology in contrast to infection with virulent sars-cov 79 8587 fig 5 in addition a more refined test for virus virulence was performed with hamsters using the activity wheel and no decrease of hamster activity was detected 7 days after hamster infection with the sars-covs lacking the e gene in contrast to those infected with a virus with full-length genome furthermore rsars-cov-e did not infect the brain of infected transgenic mice in contrast to the wt virus overall these data indicate that e is a virulence gene 79 85
 the potential mechanism of e gene product in virulence has been investigated in our laboratory we have shown that the expression of e gene drastically reduced the expression of genes involved in stress and unfolded protein responses 104 a reduction in stress responses has been associated with a decrease in the innate and specific immune responses 105108 as a consequence we have postulated that deletion of the e gene leads to an increased immune response to the virus reducing its apparent pathogenicity to generate an efficient inactivated or live modified vaccine virus titers need to be high in order to obtain an economically competitive vaccine to increase virus titers we propose a novel approach based on previous findings showing that coronavirus genomes encoding a mutated nsp14 3-5-exonuclease exon display a mutator phenotype 109 the engineered sars-cov with a mutated or deleted e protein will be modified to include an exon that causes the accumulation of mutations throughout the viral genome the mutated viruses will be passed in cell culture by infecting cells with the highest virus dilution possible these dilutions should contain only those mutant viruses with the highest titer therefore we expect that serial passages of these dilutions will select virus clones with high titers once the desired virus titers have been achieved it will be confirmed that the high titer viruses are still attenuated in vivo virus evolution will be reverted to standard levels by replacing the mutator nsp14 by the native one using the infectious cdna clone 110 selected viruses will be tested for protection as previously described we have previously shown that rsars-cov-e elicited protective immune responses 86 87 at the same time we and others have also shown that it was possible to delete additional nonessential genes to generate viable sars-cov 85 88 some of the additionally deleted genes are involved in the inhibition of ifn activation 68 111 we propose to delete some of these genes and determine whether removal of any of them increases the immune response to the vaccine candidate sars-cov e protein reduced stress unfolded protein and immune responses to the virus we have postulated that efforts to enhance assembly and levels of viral protein without diminishing the stress response which is increased in the absence of e might increase immunogenicity without compromising safety as a consequence we propose the construction of rsars-cov mutants with modified e protein e eliciting higher immune responses to the virus than rsars-cov-e in these mutants an e coding gene fully functional in virus morphogenesis is inserted within the viral genome the approach is based on the previous identification of host proteins binding sars-cov e protein influencing virus-induced stress response and the immune response to the virus e protein ligands were identified by co-immune precipitation and mass spectrometry studies as we have previously reported 112 and by yeast two-hybrid technologies 113 the effect of these proteins on the stress and immune response has been identified we propose to modify specific e protein domains in order to prevent virushost cell interactions that counteract the induction of a strong immune response by rsars-cov vaccines most of the experimental information on the influence of coronavirus replicase protein modification in attenuation has been obtained changing nsp1 and nsp2 114119 in the case of sars-cov it has been shown that nsp1 significantly inhibited ifn-dependent signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of stat1 while having little effect on those of stat2 jak1 and tyk2 115 a modification of sars-cov nsp1 mutations r124s and k125e resulted in a virus that replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus in cells with a defective ifn response while its replication was strongly attenuated in cells with an intact ifn response 115 thus it is likely that nsp1 mutants will lose virulence and have a reduced pathogenicity alternatively mutations or deletions in the nsp1 gene could be introduced similar to those described in the mhv replicase 114 116 that led to an attenuated cov phenotype these types of mutants could be investigated for their relevance in the generation of attenuated sars-cov phenotypes that could be tested for vaccine candidates deletion of nsp2 in mhv and sars-cov viruses caused 051 log10 reductions in peak titers in single-cycle growth assays as well as a reduction in viral rna synthesis and growth 117 119 these findings indicate that nsp2 is not essential for virus replication and that its deletion may lead to viruses with an attenuated phenotype in addition recent studies with mhv and hcov-229e suggest that this protein may have functions in pathogenesis 117 120 therefore nsp2 seems a promising candidate to complement the safety of a rsars-cov-e vaccine this o-glycosylated accessory protein of 274 amino acids forms a k-permeable channel-like structure 91 it is not essential for growth in tissue culture cells but deletion of the 3a gene leads to a small 510-fold reduction virus titer reduction both in vitro and in vivo 88 protein 3a may also be involved in triggering high levels of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production 121123 and its deletion may reduce sars-cov virulence gene 3a maps at a distal position from genes nsp1 or nsp2 therefore a recombination event that restores the wild phenotype for gene 3a and genes nsp1 or nsp2 in one event seems very unlikely coronavirus transcription is regulated by highly conserved sequences preceding each gene these transcriptional regulatory sequences trss are almost identical to sequences located at the 5 end of the genome just downstream of the leader sequence the trs preceding each gene encodes a complementary sequence in the newly synthesized rna of negative polarity these rnas have to hybridize with the trs located next to the leader in the process of discontinuous rna synthesis typical of covs an alternative approach for developing safer recombination-resistant live coronavirus vaccines has been developed by barics group 84 the novel procedure involves the modification of the trss in a sars-cov vaccine strain to a sequence incompatible with the trs of any known circulating covs it was postulated that recombinant events between wt coronaviruses and trs remodeled sars-cov would result in genomes containing incompatible mixed regulatory sequences that block expression of subgenomic mrnas using a molecular clone the sars-cov trs network was remodeled from acgaac to ccggat 84 this rewiring of the genomic transcription network allows efficient replication of the mutant virus icsars-crg the icsars-crg recombinant virus replicated to titers equivalent to wt virus and expressed the typical ratios of subgenomic mrnas and proteins it has been shown that this vaccine candidate provides protection against challenge with virulent sars-cov previous studies using animal covs have provided experimental evidence for humoral 124133 and t cellmediated responses to animal coronaviruses that exacerbate disease 134 as previously summarized 17 this safety concern was increased in the case of sars-cov by two studies in one report 135 antibodies that neutralized most human sars-covs also enhanced virus entry mediated by two civet cat sars-covs these viruses had s glycoproteins related to the sars-cov gd03 isolate in a second report it has been shown that the administration of mva-based sars-cov s vaccine into ferrets but not mva alone followed by live sars-cov challenge resulted in enhanced hepatitis 136 nevertheless these side effects have not been described in other studies with sars-cov in mice hamster ferrets and african green monkeys 24 35 36 44 96 137140 in general immunization with vaccine candidates has resulted in the absence of side effects nevertheless there are still three concerns that remain unaddressed one is that specific viral proteins such as sars-cov n expressed by a venezuelan equine encephalitis vee virus vector has resulted in enhanced immunopathology following viral challenge 20 similar to the immune pathology observed following vaccination with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus rsv 141143 a second main concern is the observation that sars-cov vaccines that provide protection in the absence of side effects in young mice show immunopathological complications in aged mice 20 a third consideration is that most vaccine candidates have been tested in animal models that do not fully reproduce the clinical symptoms observed in humans and with one exception no phase i clinical trials in humans have been performed therefore sars vaccine candidates would require additional rigorous clinical and immunological evaluation using the sars-cov mouse-adapted virus model and potential side effect assessment both in young and in aged animals covs have a characteristic strictly conserved genome organization with genes occurring in the order 5-pol-s-e-m-n-3 mhv virus mutants with the genes encoding the structural proteins located in a different order were constructed and it was shown that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for in vivo replication 144 some of the mutants showed an attenuated phenotype interestingly rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of cov with reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses in fact potential recombination between viruses with different gene orders most likely will lead to nonviable viruses lacking essential genes as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code all but two amino acids in the protein coding sequence can be encoded by more than one synonymous codon the frequencies of synonymous codon used for each amino acid are unequal and have coevolved with the cells translation machinery to avoid excessive use of suboptimal codons which often correspond to rare or otherwise disadvantaged trnas 145 146 this results in a phenomenon termed synonymous codon bias which varies greatly between evolutionarily distant species 147 while codon optimization by recombinant methods has been widely used to improve cross-species expression the opposite direction of reducing expression by intentional introduction of suboptimal synonymous codons has seldom been chosen 146 de novo gene synthesis with the aim of designing stably attenuated polioviruses and sars-cov is a novel strategy to construct virus variants containing synthetic replacements of virus coding sequences by deoptimizing synonymous codon usage infection with equal amounts of poliovirus particles revealed a neuroattenuated phenotype and a striking reduction of the specific infectivity of poliovirus particles 145 similar attempts have been made by barics group to design sars-cov vaccines these vaccine candidates provide protection in the mouse model system after challenge with virulent virus ralph baric personal communication due to the distribution effect of many silent mutations over large genome segments codon-deoptimized viruses should have genetically stable phenotypes and they may prove suitable as attenuated substrates for the production of vaccines the production of effective and safe vaccines for animal coronaviruses previously reported has not been satisfactory 17 18 73 74 in contrast the production of inactivated subunit vaccines based on dna and recombinant vectors or vaccines generated by reverse genetics using sars-cov genomes seem more promising vaccine candidates need to be tested in the sars-cov mouse-adapted model and in macaques in all cases using both young and aged animals later the absence of side effects and safety has to be assessed in human phase i clinical trials vaccine manufacturers have the tendency to use well-defined inactivated vaccines unfortunately this approach has limited efficacy and elicits immune responses with relatively short immunological memory a possible balance between efficacy and safety is the development of rna replication-competent propagation-defective vaccine candidates based on viral replicons that can generate one-cycle viruses using packaging cell lines 148  vaccine development and therapeutic design for 2019ncovsarscov2 challenges and chances mahnaz ghaebi abdolreza osali hamed valizadeh leila roshangar majid ahmadi   on december 31 2019 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown etiologycause in wuhan hubei province of china was reported to the world health organization who china country office sohrabi et al 2020 on 12 january 2020 the world health organization temporarily named the causative virus as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019ncov the recent outbreak of 2019ncov pandemic has so far caused more than 2000000 reported human infections and nearly 160000 deaths worldwide surpassing even the number of cases caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov combined huang et al 2020 hui et al 2020 coronaviruses covs are a family of rna viruses important in humans and numerous animal hosts of which six are known to infect humans 229e oc43 nl63 hku1 sarscov and merscov they constitute important infectious pathogens that cause severe respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals fehr  perlman 2015 the seventh human coronavirus also known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 is identified to be a novel deadly and highly contagious virus that quickly spread to over 150 countries on march 11 the who declared the outbreak of a pandemic djalante shaw  dewit 2020 it is well recognized that the virus has an unusually high speed of transmission and can survive in the environment on different surfaces for long hours which poses a serious risk negahdaripour 2020 moreover the illness causes flulike symptoms and the reports show that one person infected can easily infect others j xu et al 2020 even though coronavirus infection of humans was identified for the first time in 1960 however scientific research in this area grew only following the outbreak of sars coronavirus in the year 2003 drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 in spite of the reaction from the scientific community that was instantaneous and nearly uniform at the current state of our knowledge vaccines for covid19 seem months or even years away nabel 2013 while there is still much to be understood about the sarscov2 considerable research efforts have been made to yield answers to the basic questions of the sarscov2 behavior there is currently offlabel use of antiviral drugs for the treatment of this novel virus of coronaviruses that are not totally effective but only partially satisfactory treatment available there is an urgent need for effective and specific interventions to help tackle the growing global health burden of sarscov2 to develop an effective care plan for sarscov2 outbreak it is vital to find new targets for novel therapeutic antisarscov2 approach in de novo drug discovery it is fundamental to understand the molecular entities and specific pathways driving the virus replication during infection in this paper we review the available information on molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules in addition the computational approaches employed in systematic drug repositioning and vaccine development settings for sarscov2 are described in this procedure for example instead of traditional epitope identification upon experimental techniques being costly and timeconsuming sancheztrincado gomezperosanz  reche 2017 predictive computational methods can be the key way for screening the largescale peptide candidates it is hoped that the proposed methodology will open up new avenues for the rapid identification of candidate drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of sarscov2 coronaviruses are enveloped singlestranded rna viruses with one of the largest viral genomes found in the rna viruses that the majority are diseasecausing agents pyrc berkhout  van der hoek 2007 several phylogenetic studies subdivided the coronaviruses into four genera known as alphacovs betacovs gammacovs and deltacovs of which alpha and betacovs are pathogenic viruses for mammals and gamma and deltacovs are known to infect mainly birds paules marston  fauci 2020 most coronaviruses are addressed as common cold viruses in humans that are of zoonotic origin and cause a more serious disease in animals lake 2020 in general the gene pools of groups 1 and 2 coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats which are the reservoir of diverse covs and further spread to humans through an intermediate host or sometimes directly cui li  shi 2019 human coronaviruses are typically associated with respiratory tract diseases such as those observed in the common cold including hcov229e hcovnl63 hcovoc43 and hcovhku1 and sometimes enteric illnesses however the emergence of highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections in the last two decades has greatly illuminated their potential to cause high morbidity and mortality in humans cockrell leist douglas  baric 2018 the recent coronaviruses sarscov and merscov that are two representative members of the genus betacoronavirus emerged into the human population as zoonotic infections and were the most serious endemic illnesses associated with high mortality in the years 2003 and 2012 respectively peck burch heise  baric 2015 while no case of sarscov infection has been around since 2004 multiple sporadic cases of merscov have been reported in different countries despite the low interhuman transmissibility merscov has been identified as an infectious disease associated with high mortality rates which is about 35 and much higher than that of sars 10 donnelly malik elkholy cauchemez  van kerkhove 2019 fong 2017 it is likely that discrepancy in the outcome of merscov and sarscovinfections be explained by differential virus pathogenicity and virulence the recently identified sarscov2 also belongs to the same betacoronavirus genus the international committee on taxonomy of viruses has named the novel strain coronavirus sarscov2 as it is very similar to the known sarscov in terms of the whole genome sequence r lu et al 2020 sarscov2 has a genomic size of 30 kilobases encoding several structural and nonstructural proteins the major structural proteins which form the viral particle include spike s envelope e membrane m and the nucleocapsid n protein preliminary studies show that the sarscov2 fulllength genome is quite similar to sarscov p zhou et al 2020 however as more data become available the sarscov2 is undoubtedly distinct from sarscov and from other bat origin coronaviruses and thus it is imperative to understand the novel coronavirus demanding immediate treatment to develop effective interventions targeting sarscov2 in the next phase researchers and vaccine companies will further develop new vaccines for controlling and preventing this highly pathogenic virus there is currently no approved treatment for covid19 in humans and up to now a number of antiviral treatments such as ribavirin primarily have been used based on the experiences from sars and mers medication singhal 2020 in addition using chloroquine phosphate an old antimalarial drug is found with limited success in patients with covid19 gao tian  yang 2020 2019ncov is genetically closely related to sars coronavirus about 79 identity and merscov about 50 but more similar with 88 to two batderived sarslike coronaviruses r lu et al 2020 this virus is found to be a bat covs of the genus betacoronavirus however has displayed large genetic distances to its close relatives to be considered a new human coronavirus however the modeling study did indicate a similar structure in receptorbinding domain rbd of 2019ncov to that of sarscov with variations at some key amino acid residues emerging evidence suggest that 2019ncov might be bound to the sarscov receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 as a functional cell receptor in human r lu et al 2020 clinical features of 2019ncovinfected patients indicate multiple organ failure in addition to pneumonia ace2 acting in a first key step of 2019ncov infection may help explain the clinical features of other systems observed in these patients ace2 is expressed extensively in the endothelium of the heart liver kidney testis and intestine m yang zhao  zhang 2020 and 2019ncov may probably infect any tissues where ace2 is available the ongoing works dissecting genetic molecular interactions highlight that sarscov2 differ in several critical residues at rbd particularly gln493 from other sars strains leading to highaffinity interactions with ace2 receptors being significantly more contagious than those other viruses as a result wan shang graham baric  li 2020 one prophylactic and therapeutic strategy can be through the competitive inhibition of the ace2 receptor binding of 2019ncov by using an agent that can target the receptor m yang et al 2020 the molecular docking results revealed the binding of the five natural compounds including scutellarin nicotianamine hesperetin baicalin and glycyrrhizin to the ace2 receptor confirming antivirus effects of these agents for preventing 2019ncov disease h chen  du 2020 alternatively the high identity between 2019ncov and sarscov raised the possibility of crossreactivity of sarscovspecific antibodies with 2019ncov spike protein sprotein the modeling results validate the potential interaction between the rbd in sprotein of 2019ncov and certain antisarscov antibodies and suggest that sarscovspecific human monoclonal antibody cr3022 but not the other sarscov antibodies eg m396 cr3014 may be effective in neutralizing 2019ncov and blocking its cell infection tian et al 2020 at present numerous attempts are being made to develop monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against 2019ncov there may be more similarities in the mechanisms of cell entry for 2019ncov and sarscov which employ ace2 as entry receptor and the cellular serine protease called transmembrane protease serine 2 for activating sprotein for host cell entry hoffmann et al 2020 which might hopefully work as candidate therapeutic target for anti2019ncov intervention hoffmann et al 2020 thus in this context serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate that is approved for human use in a different indication may provide an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of 2019ncovinfected patients kawase shirato van der hoek taguchi  matsuyama 2012 y zhou et al 2015 in another effort to limit 2019ncov infection furin inhibitors have been reported to develop as a specific antiviral treatment coutard et al 2020 as the priming of viral envelope glycoproteins such spike s protein by the proteases of the target cells is essential for cell tropism and pathogenicity of virus the efficacy and extent of this cleavage event may have implication in the development of antiviral agents human furin is a protease highly expressed in lungs which cleaves the 2019ncov sprotein at a specific conserved site absent in sarscov sequences bassi zhang renner  kleinszanto 2017 and thereby generates mature infectious virus particles overall because of the fact that sprotein relates to degrees of pathogenicity transmissibility and pandemic potential sproteinbased antiviral therapies offer an attractive and seemingly efficient modality into the area of antincov treatment jiang he  liu 2005 x li geng peng meng  lu 2020 treatment regimens based on the use of sproteinbased therapeutics include antagonists of rbdace2 interaction inhibitors of sprotein cleavage proteases neutralizing antibodies sprotein inhibitors and small interfering rnas malik et al 2020 nevertheless a potential concern for the treatment of covid19 infection is the emergence of drug resistance by the rapid genomic evolution of virus during therapy the higher risk of drug resistance has most often been noted to occur when targeting single virus proteins zumla chan azhar hui  yuen 2016 even though these therapeutic strategies have demonstrated in vitro efficacy they have not undergone animal or clinical testing so far and may therefore be of limited use in our present covid19 problem it is indicated that the key to the development of new drugs able to control the cause of the recent outbreak of the deadly viral pneumonia in china requires the identification of a conserved target region within the whole coronavirus genus h yang et al 2005 despite all structural proteins including s e m and n proteins nonstructural proteins nsps withstand considerable sequence variation among different covs woo et al 2005 nsps responsible for viral replication and transcription may be adopted to target cov the sarscov encodes 16 nsps as potential virulence factors among these nsps an rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp the nsp12 which is the central subunit of the cov replicative machinery and its essential cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 play a crucial role in the replication of the sarscov genome kirchdoerfer  ward 2019 subissi et al 2014 accordingly there should be possibly interference with the binding of nsp7 or nsp8 to nsp12 to inhibit the rdrp activity of nsp12 for the development of novel antiviral agents as the comparative analyses of their amino acid sequences show high similarity with nsp7 988 and nsp8 975 of sarscov ruan et al 2020 screening for compounds disrupting nsp12nsp7nsp8 complex may evolve as novel therapies of sarscov2 based on virtual screening and docking methods seven compounds saquinavir tipranavir lonafarnib tegobuvir olysio filibuvir and cepharanthine have been suggested to have potential as efficacious new inhibitors of virus replication process ruan et al 2020 offering more opportunities for clinical assessment of antisarscov2 drugs usually betacoronaviruses produce a 800 kda polypeptide that is posttranscriptionally cleaved at certain processing sites into separate subunits the papainlike protease and 3chymotrypsinlike protease 3clpro are main proteases usually responsible for this proteolytic processing to generate various nsps and are thus important for viral replication anand ziebuhr wadhwani mesters  hilgenfeld 2003 recent studies revealed that 3clpro is conserved in sarscov2 having 12point mutations identified in the receptorbinding site that affects its binding ability to some medicinal plant compounds already used to treat viral diseases like inhibitor of sarscov 3clpro named ml188 therefore further optimization and drug development efforts were made to develop new compounds to inhibit sarscov2 3clpro and the results identified nine novel natural compounds predicted to bind with the receptorbinding site of sarscov2 3clpro which possess therapeutic activities ul qamar alqahtani alamri  chen 2020 these investigations lack experimental validation and to further address this anticovid19 drug discovery with putative clinical application more in vitro and in vivo studies are required the enzyme nsp13 helicase another potential target in the viral replication apparatus has been investigated in sarscov2 and could be structurally characterized by computational methods its nucleotide sequence predicted a protein of 596 amino acids similar to previous reports molecular dynamics simulations together with virtual screening efforts were applied to identify the interaction profile of important binding site residues of sarscov2 nsp13 helicase and potential therapeutic small molecules to find potent and selective inhibitors against sarscov2 mirza  froeyen 2020 in silico predictions were used for determining adme parameters of the identified potential hits against sarscov2 nsp13 target such as absorption distribution metabolism elimination toxicity admetox and resulting top hits were selected following removal of hits that exhibited poor admettox found to contain highrisk chemical groups mirza  froeyen 2020 to improve control strategies the research studies have attempted to develop effective treatments and prophylactic strategies including vaccination considering the cost per cured subject vaccination appears more favorable alternatively with rising morbidity and death rates the benefit of the vaccine in reducing the disease burden will be higher for this the rest of the review will focus on what is known about the development of vaccine against covid19 vaccine efficacy depends largely upon the vaccine target and platform among all platform technologies wholevirus such as liveattenuated viral vaccines and killed whole virus vaccines subunit vaccines plasmidbased dna vaccines rna replicons and viruslike particle have been developed to induce protective responses to viral infections anthony  fauci 2018 choosing a suitable vaccine platform is especially challenging and important to ensure both efficacy and safety vaccine strategy that uses inactive viruses is a classic formula for viral vaccination wh chen strych hotez  bottazzi 2020 in some cases vaccination with live virus cause complications including lung destruction and pulmonary immunopathology in mice such as infiltration with eosinophils tseng et al 2012 multiple platforms are under development andor investigation dna and rnabased platforms have great potential for speeding up the research related to this field the genetic vaccines can be made quickly requiring no culture and facilitate rapid testing allowing for more rapid development of vaccine lurie saville hatchett  halton 2020 this is particularly important because a major problem is the time it takes to produce a vaccine since the genetic sequence of the 2019ncov became available in early january some companies have made significant steps forward in the early development of a vaccine for covid19 inovio pharmaceuticals in san diego funded by the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi began animal testing of a covid19 plasmid dna vaccine called ino4800 in february 2020 and this vaccine candidate is currently under earlystage phase i clinical evaluation challener 2020 already a messenger rna vaccine expressing the stabilized sprotein of covid19 has been made and is being tested in a phase i dose escalation study by kaiser permanente washington health research institute kpwhri cohen 2020 within a short period of time at least 62 projects list of april 4 2020 have begun vaccine research against covid19 although each vaccine product must pass through several stages before application in the clinical setting new technology and previous experience with vaccine against related viruses make an enormous acceleration of the process possible this is apparently shown by the results reported by some leading companies and research groups that have made the most progress in their projects these include the projects that have already entered the clinical testing phase for vaccine against covid19 infection see table 1 or plan to do so within a few months table 2 although the viruss sprotein is considered a promising immunogen for inclusion in a nucleic acid covid19 vaccine there continues to be debate over the best approach to ensure optimal immune response for example in the current debate target antigen design in a fulllength protein or the receptorbinding domain is challenging lurie et al 2020 however several areas of consensus that are herein disclosed have emerged in this area beginning from the basics it has been demonstrated that immune response to coronavirus infection or vaccination involves early neutralizing immunoglobulin g igg antibody response against viral surface proteins zand  wang 2020 there is also some evidence that coronaviruses make use of certain antibodies for entry to the cell as an alternative mechanism of target cell binding wan et al 2020 the phenomenon called antibodydependent enhancement ade of virus infection is thought to occur when antivirus antibodies attach surface viral antigens and subsequently cause uptake of the virusigg complex via the fc family of receptors leading to viral infection of cells expressing fc receptor including macrophages monocytes b cells and vascular endothelium which may contribute to disease severity wan et al 2020 binding of igg subclasses igg1 and igg3 targeting the receptorbinding domain of coronavirus sprotein function as a mechanism for viral inactivation and clearance at the same time provides a route for viral persistence via ade and can cause severe disease by induction of cytokine storm through a mechanism that depends on these enhancing antibodies as illustrated in figure 1 jaume et al 2011 x li et al 2020 importantly specific protein sequences responsible for ade have been recognized on the sproteins of sars and covid19 coronaviruses wang et al 2016 it is also clinically demonstrated that sera from sars patients apparently contain both neutralizing igg antibodies and those that cause ade wang et al 2016 this is particularly important when modeling optimal vaccine strategy for reducing severe disease of note within the different vaccine types except for liveattenuated virus vaccines the general goal is to induce adaptive immune response against s or n viral proteins and also the increase in highaffinity igg production is of the utmost importance for planning vaccine actions these data collectively suggest that one approach may be to manipulate and modify the protein sequences to disable the potential for ade if possible zand  wang 2020 in addition given that such an adverse effect may be associated with t helper type 2 th2 immune responses extended human safety testing will be critical to this point using a suitable adjuvant with a capacity to trigger a type 1t helper th1 response and high neutralizing antibody titers theoretically is likely to be protective to avoid immunopathology lurie et al 2020 it worth noting that the use of an adjuvant in the vaccine is a reasonable approach in a pandemic that may substantially reduce the amount of vaccine material required for immunization owing to the limited worldwide production capacity for vaccine this strategy will allow more vaccine doses to be produced for widespread vaccination of populations and therefore contributes to protection of more people hotez  bottazzi 2020 the e protein has also been proposed as an attractive vaccine target for developing liveattenuated vaccines which is based on prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause mers and sarscov almazn et al 2013 for both sars and merscov the construction of an attenuated virus deleted in e protein could result in a replicationcompetent but propagationdefective virus that supports the efficacy of the attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates almazn et al 2013 deletion of e protein can be accomplished to 2019ncov and it is expected to lead to a similar breakthrough given its phylogenetic clustering with human sarscov e protein ralph et al 2020 as reported the longterm immunologic outcomes of sars survivors have been correlated with antiviral antibody responses that persisted for up to 6 years after infection and t cell responses detectable for as long as 11 years tang et al 2011 in a research published in 2016 a novel subunit vaccine based on a native conformational epitope from a merscov envelope glycoprotein was first developed tai et al 2016 and gave encouraging results that trimeric form of merscov spike receptorbinding domain is capable of inducing protective immunity in a human dpp4 transgenic hdpp4tg mouse model this vaccine candidate containing residues 377588 of merscov sprotein was shown to adhere the cellassociated dpp4 receptor and block mers pseudovirus entry into target cells displaying high crossneutralizing activity of the epitope that give rise to the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine therefore learning from the study of sars and merscovs it should be noted that a protective immune response from a vaccine must lead to antibodydependent or independent virus neutralization and potent cytotoxicity it is best to use vaccines to protect healthy individuals from infection as well as create herd immunity and to reduce the burden on health services the rapid global spread of covid19 prompts the urgent action to control the public health risk of this novel coronavirus for this purpose applying analysis tools and databases several modeling approaches have been carried out to elucidate the genetic and antigenic properties of the virus to accelerate novel vaccine design peptidebased vaccines have received more attention due to their ease of production by the chemical synthesis of dominant protective epitopes dudek perlmutter aguilar croft  purcell 2010 just as neutralizing the free virus particles before cell entry is required to prevent cells from being infected by covid19 rational vaccine design strategies based on the characterization of epitopes on the most exposed protein of the virus that can be recognized by b cell antibodies and t lymphocytes may be able to overcome the ongoing outbreak using immunoinformatics approach to find protein epitopes for vaccine development against covid19 infection several putative immune epitopes including ylqprtfll gvyfastek epvlkgvkl vvnqnaqal wtagaaayy as potential ctl epitopes and cvnlttrtqlppaytn nvtwfhaihvsgtngt and sfstfkcygvsptklndl peptides as b cellantibody epitopes from surface glycoprotein of 2019ncov were identified baruah  bose 2020 these assessments need to be followed to ensure work with related antigens in vaccine development attempts for preventive strategy of the novel virus interestingly modeling of covid19 glycoprotein could describe multiple epitope specificity of cytotoxic t cells ctl and b cells generating immune responses to covid19 and when compared with ctl epitopes predicted in the sprotein of merscov revealed one overlapping peptide epitope but no comparable epitopes with sarscov were detected baruah  bose 2020 this is an important issue because even though the genomes of covid19 share better sequence homology with sarscov and despite greater genotype distance from merscov x xu et al 2020 it may exhibit similar immunogenicity with merscov which may contribute to the immunopathological outcomes nevertheless delineating peptidebinding properties of mhchla molecules to which peptide antigens are attached is also crucial to examine subunit vaccine efficacy antigen presentation by mhc molecules is essential to immune responses mediated by cd4 and cd8 t cells in essence the characterization of the corresponding hla alleles can take a step toward designing tcellbased vaccines for that common epitopes of four structural proteins of 2019ncov and the dominant hladr alleles prevalent in the five ethnic populations were mapped using molecular modeling techniques with the immune epitope database and analysis resource consensus tool and the results illustrated eight highaffinity epitopes in the functional regions of the s and membrane proteins of the 2019ncov strain wuhanhu1 recognized by hladr furthermore the authors suggested that the administration of these immunodominant epitopes from 2019ncov as a multiepitopic peptide vaccine able to provide protective antiviral antibody and tcell responses may represent a universally potent subunit vaccine effective in different ethnic populations ramaiah  arumugaswami 2020 in another study bioinformatic analysis recognized various bcell and tcell epitopes within the 2019ncov surface glycoprotein a wide variety of sequential linear bcell epitopes and candidate tcell epitopes with mhci and mhcii binding affinity were initially obtained however the antigenicity analysis pointed out that only 13 mhci epitopes and 3 mhcii epitopes had the antigenic propensity bhattacharya et al 2020 furthermore of the sprotein oligopeptides the most immunogenic and uniquely viral epitopes were identified through comparative homo sapienscoronavirus proteome analysis using the peptide match program the 2109ncov and the human proteomes were compared and searched for viral peptides that are absent in the human proteome to increase antiviral specificity and minimizing the risk for crossreactions lucchese 2020 a total of 66 nonself sequences in the virus genome were obtained as a result that represents the best targets for vaccine development due to their potential for immunogenicity richman vonderheide  rech 2019 in addition the identification of the potential t cell epitopes of the e protein of sarscov2 proposed three peptides of yvysrvknl slvkpsfyv and lailtalrl with high binding affinity to mhci molecules as promising vaccine candidates for covid19 abdelmageed et al 2020 previous experience with developing antisars coronavirus vaccines since the last pandemic nearly 17 years ago have opened the doors to rationally develop vaccine approaches designed to counter the covid19 pandemic preliminary studies suggest that in convalescent sarscov patients immune protection is mainly associated with t cell responses against structural eg the s and n proteins rather than nonstructural cov proteins indicating that tcell epitopes in sarscov structural proteins have been found to be the most immunogenic as compared with the nonstructural proteins c kf li et al 2008 the authors claim that immune targeting of sarscovderived b cell and t cell epitopes that map identically to sarscov2 proteins may offer substantial protection against the new virus ahmed quadeer  mckay 2020 what strengthens the idea is that the determined epitopes comprise no mutations in the available sarscov2 sequences ahmed et al 2020 since genomic variations of the pathogen have significant clinical consequences the genetic diversity of sarscov2 and strategies to develop vaccine candidates are described in detail in the next section one hypothesis is that the rapid spread of sarscov2 may be due to its evolution driven by viral mutations understandably the evolution of rna viruses continues to occupy a great deal of attention dolan whitfield  andino 2018 the rapid evolution of rna viruses that utilize a highly divergent rnadependent rna polymerase is often more evident than those of dnabased viruses in fact enormous genetic diversity is a critical determinant of their adaptative capacity lauring frydman  andino 2013 nucleotide substitution in dna is often involved as one of the most important mechanisms provoking viral evolution in nature lauring  andino 2010 in the last few months genomesequencing projects have been conducted by the worldwide scientific community to understand the evolutionary dynamics and characteristics of this virus a comprehensive assessment using wholegenome sequencing discovered 93 mutations comprising 42 missense mutations across the entire genomes of sarscov2 phan 2020 among the viral proteins all the major nonstructural and structural proteins showed missense mutations and most variations occur toward the orf1ab polyprotein 29 missense mutations and in the spike surface glycoprotein eight missense mutations specifically three of these mutations were positioned in the receptorbinding domain of spike surface glycoprotein in residues d354 y364 and f367 and were expected to affect its conformational changes that probably lead to antigenic variation and the loss of binding to antibodies against sprotein of note no mutations were detected in the envelope e protein of sarscov2 phan 2020 a comparison of 10 genomic information obtained from 2019ncov samples suggest that the 2019ncov genomes would likely have low heterogeneity r lu et al 2020 data from 56 genomic sequences of distinct patient infected with 2019ncov showing 99 sequence identity have reported two hypervariable genomic hotspots and confirmed previous results of a high level of genomic conservation within 2019ncov ceraolo  giorgi 2020 with potential implications in epitope definition the proteome analysis also reported the polymorphic variants corresponding to the two variable regions the viral orf8encoded proteinbearing serineleucine variation and a large gene encoding for a polyprotein orf1ab translation of which results an 800 kda polyprotein were described as the two most variable locations in the core genome ceraolo  giorgi 2020 another important aspect of virus replication may be at the functional contact between virus and host several viruses including coronaviruses require host cellular factors to replicate zumla et al 2016 furthermore repeated observations in other families of rna viruses indicate that many if not most mutations are surfacelocated and that the conserved residues are probably core residues of viral proteins cheng  brooks iii 2013 patel  kukol 2017 warren wan conant  korkin 2013 a more indepth analysis of the intraviral and virushost proteinprotein interactions of sarscov2 has revealed several findings srinivasan et al 2020 a the spatial patterns of mutations that affect protein functional surfaces are bidentified in a substantial number of sarscov2 proteins and were also analyzed in terms of ligandbinding abilities of human sarscov2 and b all proteinbinding sites of nonstructural proteins revealed fully conserved residues supporting the notion that groups of mutations unlikely disrupt the proteinprotein interaction of viral proteins srinivasan et al 2020 the sarscov2 sequenced genome is predicted to have 16 nonstructural proteins nsp1nsp16 involving in the intraviral heteromeric complexes such as nsp7nsp8nsp12 nsp10nsp16 and nsp10nsp14 srinivasan et al 2020 targeting of which may be critical for developing effective antiviral sarscov2 therapies and vaccine taking advantage of all the currently available information we postulated that the low variability within the new pandemic virus 2019ncov contributes to mount the possibility of developing a practical vaccine that would confer protection against the new virus strain generally the clinical development of a new vaccine requires many years of efforts in this area however with the milestone experience of a successful vaccine for the eradication of severe footandmouth disease caused by ev71 virus it has been possible to develop vaccines against a modern highly pathogenic emerging virus s lu 2014 j xu et al 2010 moreover having the results of previous efforts related to sarscov and mers vaccine research available first steps have been taken toward achieving an effective vaccine to respond to the threat of this emerging virus this is readily apparent from a recent study begun at kpwhri in seattle a part of the national institutes of health that was allowed to quickly proceed to phase i trial to determine human safety and efficacy of an investigational vaccine designed to protect against covid19 which was related to their experience as an nih clinical trials center since 2007 challener 2020 the question then at issue became factors affecting the choice of vaccines for vaccine developers highlevel attention is focused on the safety evaluation of a new candidate vaccine against sars2 in humans as the immune response to virus plays a major role in the pathogenesis of sars2 infection it is important to ensure that vaccine should not induce immunopathological injury of host cells in this regard the foremost issue to be considered is the type of vaccines and the immunogens selected indeed the promise of future vaccine development would be most applicative by rational design of new vaccine candidates subunit vaccines are generally safe to use this vaccine type is most often composed of one or multiple recombinant protein or synthetic peptidebased formulations deng hu wang  deng 2012 subunit vaccines offer many advantages over liveattenuated or inactivated organisms unlike inactivated or liveattenuated virus vaccines subunit vaccines are known to provide better efficacy as they are unable to revert to the virulent form of the pathogen and eliminate the risk of incomplete inactivation thus making them biologically safe however they typically require coadministration with adjuvants zhang et al 2012 based on this information the subunit candidates such as fulllength sprotein andor the rbd element of sarscov2 prove valuable for prevention against covid19 shang yang rao  rao 2020 though they are expensive to manufacture and need for repeated injections phillpotts venugopal  brooks 1996 moreover subunit vaccines can be designed to contain wellcharacterized neutralizing epitopes defined as those epitopes which elicit a neutralizing antibody response but avoiding epitopes with pathological ade effects to improve immunogenicity naz  dabir 2007 another scientific challenge for vaccine development may be dependent to the strategies of vaccine delivery evidence of respiratory tract infection and findings of sars2 in stool holshue et al 2020 q li et al 2020 suggest that mucosal delivery routes by oral or aerosol administration of vaccine appear to be the possible modes of sarscov2 immunization epidemiological studies have shown that the disease caused by sarscov2 is significantly associated with a higher age in which individuals above 50 years of age often exhibit more severe pathology following sarscov2 infection and are more likely to die from infection in many viral infections the naive younger individuals experience milder manifestations of the disease because it affects the health of older people more strongly vaccine as a public health measure must protect this vulnerable population amanat  krammer 2020 unfortunately it is precisely in this population that vaccines are the least efficacious because of immune senescence sambhara  mcelhaney 2009 as of current influenza vaccines specific formulations including highdose antigen or using an adjuvant may be particularly useful for this segment of the population amanat  krammer 2020 diazgranados et al 2013 interestingly even if vaccination does not result in protection in all recipients it is still able to stop the transmission of the virus and thereby benefits older individuals amanat  krammer 2020 finally once a successful sars2 vaccine is developed and available the responsibility to let the global access to it should be a part of planning nonetheless apart from the availability of the vaccine still social clinical and economic hurdles face sars2 vaccine and vaccination programmes that include for example willingness of the public to get a new vaccination the potential variation in efficiency for quite different populations as well as severe adverse reactions arising from the new vaccine pang et al 2020 our review of the available relevant literature summarized the published information regarding covid19 vaccine research and development in summary extensive bioinformatics analysis in the past few months has helped provide a unique opportunity to a better understanding of determinants of immunogenicity immunodominance and structurefunction relationships that can to a great extent reduce the experimental cost in epitope identification for vaccine design as well as limit the pool of peptides available for analysis while research into such efforts is in its early stages the prospect of a preventative or therapeutic vaccine seems realistic as a result of a more intense global cooperation and also by taking advantage of the gathered data on sars and mers as data collection continues we are getting closer to finding better ways to conquer this disease first and foremost accurate and up to date data on the status and timing of vaccine production and release must be accessible meanwhile the collaboration of countries from all over the world is clearly needed in producing a preventive or therapeutically desired result the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests m g and m a were involved in drafting the manuscript m a has critically reviewed the manuscript content  mrna vaccines possible tools to combat sars-cov-2 changhua yi yongxiang yi junwei li   coronaviruses are large enveloped positive-strand rna viruses several coronaviruses are pathogenic in humans including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and this novel virus sars-cov-2 which has caused the global pandemic currently genetic sequencing suggests that sars-cov-2 is related to sars-cov and its close relatives chen et al 2020 there are four genera of coronavirus including alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus like other betacoronaviruses the genome of sars-cov-2 codes four major structural proteins including the spike surface glycoprotein which is called s protein small envelope protein matrix protein and nucleocapsid protein s proteins are type i transmembrane proteins with a large ectodomain and a short endodomain coronavirus replication is initiated by the binding of s protein to the cell surface receptors the s protein is composed of two functional subunits s1 bulb for receptor binding and s2 stalk for membrane fusion specific interaction between s1 and receptor triggers a drastic conformational change in the s2 subunit leading to the fusion between the virus envelope and the cellular membrane and release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm receptor binding is the major determinant of host range and tissue tropism for a coronavirus cui et al 2019 sars-cov-2 is able to use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells indicating that ace2 is likely the cell receptor of sars-cov-2 zhou et al 2020 mclellan et al showed biophysical and structural evidence that sars-cov-2 s protein binds ace2 with higher affinity than sars-cov s protein wrapp et al 2020 to date although some repurposed drugs showed inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 no drugs have been licensed to be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection or other coronavirus infections in humans and no vaccines have been licensed to prevent these infections just days after chinese scientists shared the genetic map of sars-cov-2 scientists around the world along with a list of biotech and vaccine companies promptly launched a race to pursue different types of vaccines to prevent infection with this novel virus up to the end of april 2020 at least 115 sars-cov-2 vaccine projects have been announced to be in development including vectored vaccines oral vaccines subunit vaccines inactivated vaccines peptide-based vaccines nucleotide-based vaccine etc several sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates have recently been approved for clinical phase i or ii development thanh le et al 2020 among these sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates mrna vaccines are quite remarkable what is mrna vaccine unlike traditional vaccines an mrna vaccine consists of an mrna sequence encoding a disease-specific antigen once delivered into target cells the antigen is expressed processed presented and recognized by the immune system and a strong humoral and t cell immune response will be instigated compared to vaccine production of whole microbes live attenuated and subunit vaccines mrna vaccines are believed to be faster and less expensive to produce and they do not involve in any living stage of the pathogenic virus or bacteria this manufacturing process makes mrna vaccines a promising bioproduct and potentially fills the gap between the desperate demand for vaccines to control disease outbreaks and epidemics with the potential to scale and standardize the vaccine manufacturing process the process of mrna vaccine development is illustrated in fig 1 exemplified by the mrna vaccine coding the s gene of sars-cov-2 currently most of the components needed for mrna vaccine production are available at the good manufacturing practices gmp grade to satisfy commercialization two forms of mrna vaccines have been developed including conventional mrna vaccines and self-amplifying mrna sam vaccines conventional mrna encoding target antigen can be synthetically produced including an open reading frame orf for the target antigen and 5 and 3 untranslated regions utrs through a cell-free enzymatic transcription reaction the in vitro transcription reaction includes linearized plasmid dna encoding the pathogen antigen as a template recombinant rna polymerase and nucleoside triphosphates a cap analog and a polya tail are added sequentially to the transcriptional product following the reaction to form a functional mrna after injection transient and low levels of antigen expression are driven zhang et al 2019 sam vaccines are derivatives of alphavirus rna replication with the structural protein sequences replaced with the antigen gene generating multiple copies of the antigen-encoding mrna and expressing high levels of the heterologous gene then in vitro transcribed ivt mrna is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles and delivered into cells consequently humoral and t cell immune responses are stimulated the immune response mechanism instigated by mrna remains to be elucidated the dimension of the immune response is dependent on the quality of the ivt mrna delivery vehicle and administration route in the last two decades mrna vaccines have been investigated extensively for infectious disease prevention and cancer immunotherapy several mrna vaccines against infectious disease have showed a promising future such as mrna vaccines against influenza viruses rabies virus hiv ebola virus and zika virus demoulins et al 2016 maruggi et al 2019 although clinical trials of mrna vaccines for infectious disease are still in their early stage a plethora of publications have shown that mrna-based vaccines are a promising novel platform that is highly flexible scalable inexpensive and cold-chain-free the growing body of preclinical and clinical results demonstrates that prophylaxis and therapy with mrna promises to be useful for the prevention of infectious disease and that mrna vaccines are safe and tolerated in animal models and humans despite the great challenges in the creation of new processes to generate mrna vaccines such as delivery and translation efficiency these processes hopefully will be streamlined to establish large-scale production it is just a matter of time for mrna vaccines to be used in humans and animals several biopharmaceutical companies have announced promptly the establishment of mrna vaccine projects for sars-cov-2 since its outbreak on january 23 2020 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi announced the initiation of three programs to develop vaccines against sars-cov-2 moderna an mrna-based biotechnology company announced that it has received funding from cepi and would manufacture an mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 using their mrna vaccine platform technology and it has partnered with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to develop a vaccine for the wuhan strain of coronavirus the niaid will conduct investigational new drug ind-enabling studies and a phase i clinical study in the us in projects conducted by moderna approximately 1000 people have received different versions of mrna vaccines so far in seven clinical trials designed to prevent illness from other respiratory viruses including a strain of the flu respiratory syncytial virus rsv and human metapneumovirus hmpv mrna vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 developed by moderna is the first one entering phase i clinical trial moderna 2020 in february 2019 cepi agreed to provide up to 34 million in support of curevacs technology development which will provide a rapid supply of lipid-nanoparticle-formulated mrna vaccine candidates that can target known pathogens and prepare for rapid response to new and previously unknown pathogens the principle of curevacs proprietary technology is the use of mrna as a genetic information carrier to instruct the human body to produce its own proteins capable of fighting a wide range of diseases additionally the federal ministry of education and research has committed a total of 90 million euros to support this work smith 2020 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in china have also stepped up to the development of vaccines of sars-cov-2 four sars-cov-2 vaccines have been approved for phase i or ii clinical trial in china at the end of april of 2020 several biotechnology companies have announced the development of mrna vaccines against this mated coronavirus in early january 2020 stermirna therapeutics cooperating with shanghai east hospital of tongji university proclaimed that no more than 40 days will be needed to produce vaccine samples based on the new generation of mrna technology and some preliminary procedures the samples would be sent for tests and be brought to clinics as soon as possible xinhua net 2020 on february 12 2020 the institute of advanced technology of shenzhen announced that the first batch of mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 was being prepared under gmp standards the mrna matching the requirement for the clinical trial would be ready in april 2020 siat 2020 on february 14 zhuhai lifanda biotechnology announced that an antibody against antigen encoded by mrna was detected in mouse serum at day 12 after the mice had been immunized data on rhesus macaques immunized with mrna vaccine candidates would be obtained soon the mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 would go into clinical testing within 23 months a gmp factory would be put into use in april 2020 cnbeta 2020 like other coranaviruses s protein of sars-cov-2 plays an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell to initiate an infection and determines host tropism it is also the major target of neutralizing antibodies and it may be the main antigen of development of sars-cov-2 vaccines by most related groups according to the public information s protein or receptor binding domain rbd sites are main antigens edcoded by sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates however due to the limited information and patent protection on the adaptation of antigens of sars-cov-2 vaccines in development the antigen information of most sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates are unclear the expected immune response such as antibody or t cell mediated immune response stimulated by these sars-cov-2 vaccines in development are not clear either thus accordingly the protection against sars-cov-2 can not to be predicted during the development of sars-cov and mres-cov vaccines some groups found that enhanced lung inflammation following homologous challenge in mice and nonhuman primates was mediated by s specific igg liu et al 2019 wan et al 2020 antibody-dependent enhancement ade was initially found to be induced by dengue vaccine katzelnick et al 2017 ade was also observed in other vaccines later such as influenza vaccine winarski et al 2019 ade modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation lymphopenia andor cytokine storm one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths ade also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes currently immunologists are worrying that sars-cov-2 mrna vaccines based on s protein maybe induce ade which will blur the adaptation in the prevention and control of sars-cov-2 pandemic however in a recent paper qin et al reported inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine was safe in nonhuman primate and has not induced ade in macaques gao et al 2020 the other obstacle to developing a successful sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine is the abundant glycosylation sites on the s protein which facilitate the escaping of sars-cov-2 from neutralization by the s protein specific antibodies vankadari and wilce 2020 as a novel vaccine platform mrna vaccine technology is not mature to be used in immune prophylaxis and therapy it still needs improvement and has uncertainty in the sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine development the mechanisms of immunity induction of mrna vaccine in vivo are under elucidation published results showed mrna vaccines stimulated potent immune response but in human the immune response is not strong enough with low dose of antibodies pardi et al 2018b the delivery tool and administration route determine the dimension of immune response by mrna vaccine pardi et al 2018a so far there at least 14 sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine projects had been announced globally who 27 may 2020 regularly the general stages of the development cycle of a vaccine include the exploratory stage the preclinical stage clinical development regulatory review and approval manufacturing and quality control the process of the creation testing and production of a vaccine in mass quantities can take many years because the industry is highly regulated for mrna vaccines against sars-cov-2 infection developers should speed up the process to make them available as soon as possible however until a safe effective vaccine is commercial available the best protection from infection with sars-cov-2 is to follow the suggestions of public health experts  human challenge studies to accelerate coronavirus vaccine licensure nir eyal marc lipsitch peter smith g   volunteers for human challenge studies would be drawn from previously uninfected individuals at relatively low risk of complications or mortality from sars-cov-2 infection eg young adults without chronic health conditions and not otherwise sick 37 and who are at substantial risk of natural exposure to sars-cov-2 eg resident in areas with high transmission rates such a target group might comprise uninfected persons aged 2045 years an age range in which the risk of death or serious complications following infection is substantially lower than in older age groups 4 5 the controlled challenge model would need to be standardized before using it to test vaccines volunteers previously uninfected would be required for an initial dose-escalation study of the viral challenge to select a dose of virus exposure such that most placebo recipients become infected for statistical reasons and have a clinical response that is not more severe than the one associated with natural infection for ethical reasons the latter would require comparison with a cohort of individuals of similar age who had been infected naturally for this standardization volunteers may spend 2 weeks in a clinical isolation facility prior to the challenge with viral and serologic testing to exclude those with previous or recent infection or a shorter duration if suitable serological tests for recent infections are developed overall these preparatory studies upper-left black square in figure 1 may take several weeks and could start before vaccine candidates are available for evaluation multiple measures would be put in place to ensure that prior to consenting potential participants fully comprehend the unusual risks involved in the study after the controlled human challenge model had been set up vaccines could be evaluated volunteers who had not been previously infected would be randomized to receive either the candidate vaccines under investigation or placebo after an interval to permit a full immune response to the vaccine a controlled exposure to sars-cov-2 would be administered appropriate vaccine schedules eg dose number of doses will have been determined to the extent possible in the conventional phase 12 immunogenicity and safety studies that preceded the challenge study following the challenge the participants would be carefully followed to monitor whether those vaccinated had a different response to viral challenge because the challenge studies would be relatively small and some volunteers might show few clinical symptoms there would need to be careful consideration of the choice of the primary endpoint through discussions with regulatory authorities possibilities would include viral load measured at least daily eg in throat swabs and then cumulated over the course of the infection as has been done in influenza challenge studies 8 and time to first clinical symptoms for some vaccines the endpoint might be the proportion infected throughout the study intense immunological monitoring would seek any correlates of vaccine effect the required size of such studies would depend upon the endpoints chosen but they might require of the order of 100 volunteers any volunteers in whom infection was confirmed would receive excellent care for covid-19 including priority for any scarce life-saving resources in state-of-the-art facilities throughout the trial and until infectiousness was ruled out all participants would remain isolated in a secure and comfortable setting eg in settings converted from those used for influenza challenge studies if this human challenge study showed a vaccine candidate to be efficacious an expanded placebo-controlled study would be conducted in the field involving at least 3000 vaccinated persons primarily for short-term safety assessment but also to gather further evidence on immunogenicity figure 1 right-most black box participants would be carefully monitored for adverse effects following vaccination to gather safety data sufficient for submission for licensure this study not involving a challenge should be conducted on the eventual primary initial target group for an effective vaccineincluding the elderly and those with concomitant illnesses that increase the risk of serious disease following infection with prior planning this large-scale assessment of safety could be completed in several months as initially only short-term adverse effects would be assessed together the information from the challenge study and the short-term follow-up of those in the expanded phase 2 field study may produce evidence sufficient to justify accelerated licensure participants of the expanded field study could continue to be followed longer term in parallel with the submission for licensure so that suitable actions could be taken if any long-term adverse effects including disease enhancement were identified as with standard vaccine licensure additional postapproval studies would be required to assess safety and effectiveness in routine use any necessary studies of dosage and safety in special groups eg children pregnant women and immunocompromised persons could be conducted before extending vaccination to these groups as judged appropriate it is possible that the protection that was apparent in a challenge study will not be replicated when the vaccine is used to protect against natural infection this would have to be carefully monitored in the early stages of vaccine rollout for example through case-control studies in such an event appropriate modification will be made to the vaccination program including potentially stopping vaccination a particular concern with respect to some vaccine constructs against coronavirus is that they may induce more severe disease following infection as has been reported in animal models of both sars and mers vaccine candidates 9 if any vaccine candidate shows evidence of such effects in animal models it is likely to be ruled out for human testing however for those candidates that are taken forward for human testing the possibility of enhancement should be borne in mind and the challenge studies should be designed in such a way that small groups of volunteers are challenged sequentially in this way studies could be stopped at an early stage upon first strong indication of vaccine-induced enhanced disease if the vaccine candidate did enhance disease the controlled human challenge model would provide much more rapid evidence to support stopping the testing of a harmful vaccine candidate with far fewer vaccinated persons than a traditional phase 3 efficacy study the proposed trial method would potentially cut the wait time for the rollout of an efficacious vaccine challenge studies which always directly expose all participants to a pathogen to assess efficacy generally require fewer participants followed over a shorter period than do standard efficacy studies in which many participants are never exposed rollout of an efficacious vaccine to age groups not included in the challenge studies may depend on immunological bridging but this would be a component of the expanded safety studies discussed above it is possible that this process could take several months shorter than reliance on standard phase 3 testing to assess efficacy while rollout to other populations might require initial bridging studies these could be conducted relatively quickly it seems clear that in the absence of an efficacious vaccine the global death toll from covid-19 will be enormous a recent modelling study suggests that even with mitigation strategies focusing on shielding the elderly and slowing but not interrupting transmission there may be 20 million this year 10 if the use of human challenge helped to make the vaccine available before the epidemic has completely passed the savings in human lives could be in the thousands or conceivably millions intense social distancing and related control measures held in place for many months between now and the availability of vaccine will themselves take a toll on economies societies and population health advancing the registration and rollout of an efficacious vaccine even by a few months could save many thousands of lives and commands enormous societal value deliberate exposure of study participants to sars-cov-2 gives rise to understandable ethical worries it may seem impermissible to ask people to take on risk of severe illness or death even for an important collective gain but we actually ask people to take such risks for others direct gain every time we ask volunteer firefighters to rush into burning buildings relatives to donate a live organ to loved ones healthy volunteers to participate in drug and vaccine toxicity trials with no prospect of improving their health and some risk of undermining it 11 relatively healthy volunteers to participate in studies involving long antiretroviral drug interruptions that risk their health with negligible prospect of improving it 12 and other challenge studies in which healthy volunteers expose themselves to pathogens 13 this spring we are clearly within our right when we invite citizens to volunteer for emergency medical services ems to fight a pandemic that augments both the personal risks for ems workers and the social value of their work and initial trials for the moderna sars-cov-2 vaccine are being accelerated by skipping prior animal testing and the margin of safety that it would have added 14 one major reason why it is permissible to risk medical harm to volunteers in medical studies even when their personal health care does not require that risk is that these volunteers will have autonomously consented to take on these risks adult persons can legitimize many interventions in their bodies and health that are normally prohibited simply by saying yes with full understanding and voluntariness in the present case the study would involve multiple tests of comprehension of all risks and the risk factors for serious outcomes among individuals in otherwise low-risk age groups may be somewhat clearer by the time recruitment takes place so that the decision is deeply informed and voluntary the exclusive recruitment of participants aged 2045 years although children are less likely to have severe symptoms upon covid-19 infection 6 7 seeks to safeguard the quality of participants consent the wide news coverage and widespread fear of covid-19 should keep it clear that exposure to this virus is no small matter while in other studies mentioned above nonconsenting sex partners and fetuses of study participants may get infected 15 16 the proposed controlled challenge study would avoid risk to nonparticipants by isolating participants whilst infectious but a remaining key question for deeming human challenge studies ethical pertains to risk are the risks to participants even when they are justified by the social importance of the trial and backed by participants willful permission also being kept to the necessary minimum and do the risks fall below a postulated cap on the acceptable risk of medical trials even ones of the highest social value and with participants consent 15 the proposed challenge studies seek to contain the risk to participants in 6 different ways first the study will recruit only healthy patients from age groups in which the risk of severe disease and death following sars-cov-2 infection is low second there is the possibility that the vaccine candidate will protect at least some of those who are vaccinated third in the absence of an effective vaccine a high proportion of the general population is likely to be naturally infected with sars-cov-2 at some point 17 including those who might participate in a challenge study by volunteering to be artificially infected they may be just hastening an event that is likely to occur in later months anyhow fourth only people with an especially high baseline risk of getting exposed during or soon after the trial period should be recruited eg people residing in areas with high transmission rates fifth participants would be monitored carefully and frequently following the challenge and afforded the best available care if needed eg guaranteed access to state-of-the-art facilities of the health system notwithstanding the possibility of severe shortages of medical care during the evolving pandemic sixth by the time vaccine candidates are being tested some therapeutics may be approved which may reduce participants risk of morbidity and mortality further for these 6 reasons mortality and morbidity from participation notwithstanding net mortality and morbidity from participation should remain low or negative a novel strain of coronavirus forces us to consider unconventional approaches we believe that controlled sars-cov-2 vaccine challenge studies may accelerate the time it takes to evaluate and license vaccines and hence could make vaccines available sooner for widespread rollout such an approach is not without risks but every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally importantly challenge studies are conducted against the background of competent volunteers informed consent minimization of study risks and high baseline risks of infection for participants they do not violate participants individual rights on the altar of emergency response but heed both individual rights and the global public health emergency as far as we are aware the current plan for evaluating the efficacy of covid-19 vaccines is through slower phase 3 trials it will take some time to develop and operationalize challenge studies and we are not suggesting that ongoing development of any vaccines which become ready for phase 3 trials must be paused during this period however we believe that challenge studies could be set up before the time that most vaccines would be ready for efficacy testing in addition to their use for assessing the efficacy of vaccines human challenge studies may also help evaluate drugs that might be given either as preexposure prophylaxis to prevent infection in individuals at high risk of infection or as postexposure prophylaxis given shortly after a potential exposure either to abort infection or to prevent the occurrence of disease challenge studies may also be a way of advancing understanding of the pathogenesis of the progression from infection to disease to further assess the potential of human challenge studies to speed vaccine development we suggest that an expert group might be convened including those with experience of human challenge studies of other pathogens regulators vaccine trialists ethicists potential participants and relevant funding agencies to plan if and how such studies might be taken forward ethically and expeditiously  emerging prevention and treatment strategies to control covid-19 vipul singh k abhishek mishra shubhra singh premranjan kumar manisha singh chinnaswamy jagannath arshad khan   the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has become a global health emergency on a pandemic scale covid-19 is a severe respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 12 the emergence of sars-cov-2 was first detected in wuhan china in december 2019 sars-cov-2 infections spread rapidly and globally causing enormous distress and loss of life in no time though most sars-cov-2 infections cause only mild symptoms 1015 of patients develop the severe disease that requires hospitalization with 5 requiring intensive care in the united states alone the centers for disease control and prevention reports over 2 million covid-19 patients and over 110 thousand related deaths so far worldwide sars-cov-2 has infected over 8 million people and caused over 400 thousand deaths as of 16 june 2020 httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus as a newly emerged strain of coronavirus sars-cov-2 was rapidly identified as the causative agent of the outbreak sars-cov-2 contains a genomic sequence closely related to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov 3 and both these viruses are zoonotic this is thus among some of the rare cases of an animal to human transmission of virus infection with pandemic potential 4 common symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection include fever cough and difficulty in breathing in severe cases the infection can result in death 5 the pathogenesis of the sars-cov-2 infection is not completely clear yet our present understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis so far is based on a limited number of investigated cases of sars-cov-2 and extrapolations from other similar coronavirus infections such as sars-cov and mers-cov 678 the probable courses of immunopathological events postulated based on limited studies on covid-19 along with past studies with sars-cov have been illustrated in figure 1 transmission of infection between humans is facilitated by close contact with covid-19 patients as evidenced by the rapid global spread of the infection all around the world in a short period of time sars-cov-2 likely originated in bats and may have amplified in an intermediate host before infecting humans sars-cov-2 enters the human body via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors 9 current evidence indicates the mortality rate for sars-cov-2 could be approximately 3 which is significantly lower than sars-cov 10 and mers-cov 40 10 nonetheless sars-cov-2 has much higher transmissibility r0 1455 than both sars-cov r0 25 and mers-cov r0 1 11 given the severity of covid-19 the rapid global dispersion of sars-cov-2 and the declaration of the sars-cov-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization there is a pressing and increasing need for new diagnostics vaccines and therapeutic options for this new threat however in this early phase of the sars-cov-2 outbreak a comprehensive prevention and treatment strategies is lacking due to limited knowledge about this virus in efforts to mitigate the current covid-19 pandemic government agencies and scientific and medical communities worldwide are working on new approaches to reduce infection and decrease mortality rates among infected individuals 12 so far neither vaccines nor direct-acting antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of this disease for now most of the countries with a high case burden have adopted a combination of large-scale testing contact tracing isolation and quarantine in parallel with social-distancing measures to curb the covid-19 pandemic until a durable cure or prevention strategy is developed while these measures have slowed down the spread of the disease and bought us more time to develop treatment and prevention strategies there is a pressing need for a resilient solution that can effectively control the disease the most effective strategy to control the disease is to develop a vaccine and many industrial and academic organizations are racing to develop one but face many challenges to achieve this goal at an unprecedented timeline therapeutic drug options have been actively explored including through many ongoing clinical trials to reduce the severity of disease and death rate this review provides an overview and analysis of most current advances in vaccines and therapeutics development against covid-19 while also discussing some of the major roadblocks and challenges that we face to halt this emerging virus infection remdesivir is a promising antiviral drug against rna viruses including sarsmers-cov in cultured cells mice and nonhuman primate models 17 remdesivir is an adenosine analog that activates nucleoside triphosphate metabolites to inhibit viral rna polymerases in a nonhuman primate model intravenous administration of remdesivir 10 mgkg resulted in 100 protection against ebola virus infection 18 remdesivir is currently under clinical development for the treatment of ebola virus infection 19 in a recent double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of intravenous administration in adults hospitalized with covid-19 remdesivir shortened the recovery time of patients by 31 though it could not reduce the mortality rate to a significant extent these initial results of remdesivir-mediated improvement of recovery time in clinical trials granted its fda approval for critically ill covid-19 patients 202122 nonetheless given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir it is apparent that treatment with this antiviral drug alone may be less likely to be sufficient a combination of remidesivir with other drugs is another alternative approach currently being explored in clinical trials to improve patient outcomes in covid-19 since a hyperactive immune response leading to cytokine storm has been found to be associated with increased disease severity and mortality the addition of anti-inflammatory agent baricitinib to the remdesivir regimen is being explored in clinical trials nct04401579 to examine its potential in improving mortality outcomes several other existing antiviral drugs previously developed or used as treatments for other viral diseases are also being actively investigated as possible covid-19 treatment options with some already moved into clinical trials table 1 while the existence of evidence in support of these antiviral drugs is scant and preliminary in studies so far more comprehensive studies on these drugs can build and extend the arsenal of anti-sars-cov-2 agents chloroquine a well-known drug used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune disorders has been previously shown to exhibit antiviral activity against hiv zika virus and coronavirus 232425 under in vitro culture condition chloroquine blocks viral infection by increasing the endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion 26 it also prevents terminal glycosylation of the ace2 receptor of the host cell which is required for viruscell fusion chloroquine mediated block of virus replication and entry in the host cell have been reported for many other viruses including borna disease virus minute virus of mice the avian leucosis virus and hepatitis a virus 2527 these promising in vitro data suggested that chloroquine could be one of the promising drugs to treat covid-19 however the lack of robust preclinical data and potential safety issues of this drug remained to be addressed to date multiple clinical trials of chloroquine have been conducted either as a standalone drug or in combination with other drugs with and without randomization and placebo controls 28 while no significant effect of chloroquine on improvement in disease outcome could be ascertained in most of the studies reports of adverse events have been observed in some cases including ventricular arrhythmias qt prolongation and other cardiac toxicity indicating that this drug may pose risk to covid-19 patients if not given methodically and at the right dose 2930 interestingly chloroquine is also known to affect immune system activity by mediating an anti-inflammatory response which might reduce the pathology of covid-19 due to the exaggerated inflammatory response it triggers during the progression of the disease 31 however no studies have yet evaluated the use of chloroquine for prophylaxis against covid-19 future studies that can better elucidate the most effective dose schedule of administration and adverse events along with its prophylaxis effect on the disease will confirm whether it has any potential in controlling covid-19  the structure-based design of antiviral drug candidates 11a and 11b aldehyde based indole-2-carboxamide compounds which target the sars-cov-2 main protease recently exhibited in vitro antiviral activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in vivo suggesting that they may also be promising drug candidates 32 while the in vivo pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies showed encouraging results for these two new compounds their efficacy against viral infection still needs to be validated in vivo in an appropriate experimental infection model before forwarding to clinical trials a more detailed review of the clinical studies of many other pathogen-targeting drugs including remdesivir and chloroquine has been described in other recent reports 2133 the high morbidity of sars-cov-2 patients is due to acute respiratory distress characterized by a cytokine storm that leads to increased plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines il-2 7 10 and 17 gm-csf interferon--inducible protein 10 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha and tnf- 34 tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 receptor has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and promising clinical outcomes tocilizumab can suppress cytokine storms improve respiratory function and normalize body temperature 35 however this is a single observation study with a limited number of covid-19 patients and hence may have a significant bias covid-19 mortality has been found to be associated with myocarditis in the setting of ards and a th17 type immune response has been reported to drive more severe viral myocarditis 36 this suggests that anti-il-17 therapy could be another potential approach in managing the disease severity and decreasing the mortality related to covid-19-induced myocarditis low-dose steroids such as prednisolone and tacrolimus have also been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines that exacerbate lung pathology 37 given that pneumonia is secondary to a deleterious inflammatory process during covid-19 disease progression the use of prednisolone andtacrolimus for severe covid-19 lung injury patients thus could have a positive clinical effect clinical trials are already underway to evaluate the efficacy of these two immunosuppressive drugs in decreasing the secondary pathological manifestation of lung pneumonia in covid-19 patients nct04341038  another host-directed approach is to target the aceace receptor and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas of the host cell to reduce the chances of infection hypertension drugs lisinopril ace inhibitor and losartan angiotensin ii receptor-blocker arbs can increase the expression of ace2 receptors which may exacerbate viral load in cells 38 however some studies suggest that ace inhibitors and arbs could benefit patients with covid-19 since ace2 converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin which may have beneficial vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties though the usefulness of ace inhibitors or arbs is uncertain and based on retrospective cohort studies arb was recently approved for clinical trials to evaluate its potential for the treatment of covid-19 patients 1339 another alternative approach is to use recombinant human ace2 as the virus may more readily bind to the soluble ace2 in comparison to ace2 receptors on the cell surface this approach of preventing virus entry in the cells has shown promising preclinical results leading to its transition into clinical trials already 1339 camostat mesilate is another potential candidate drug that is being considered as a host-directed therapy for covid-19 patients camostat mesilate which is used primarily for treating postoperative reflux esophagitis and for acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis could block spread and pathogenesis of sars-cov in a pathogenic mouse model it is known to inhibit the host serine protease tmprss2 which primes the spike protein of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses 40 and since sars-cov-2 is also dependent on host tmprss2 13 it is a viable target for host-directed therapies based on more than 15 years of safe clinical track record in japan and efficacy against sars-cov in preclinical studies a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial for repurposing this drug for covid-19 is already in progress nct04353284 convalescent plasma cp is passive immunotherapy that has been used to improve the survival rate of patients with infectious diseases for over a century 55 cp administration reduced mortality rates and shortened hospital stays in patients with sars 56 various studies demonstrate that severely ill covid-19 patients treated with cp showed a lower mortality rate compared to untreated controls 57 a new study reported that critically ill covid-19 patients n  10 treated with cp transfusion demonstrated significantly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies and depletion of viral load in 7 days clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria in these patients improved within 3 days 58 placebo-controlled clinical trials to test cp therapy are ongoing in china nct04264858 and larger studies also started in the usa houston methodist hospital houston texas mount sinai medical center new york new york etc after it was approved by the us food and drug administration for covid-19 treatment 5960 cp from covid-19-recovered patients is used to treat patients infected with sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2-specific igg antibodies received from sars-cov-2-recovered patients are passively transferred via transfused plasma and may neutralize viral particles and stimulate the complement system to encourage viral elimination 61 while the results from some of the more recent clinical trials are encouraging 6263 validation of these results from large randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials is needed to further establish the effectiveness of cp therapy cp dose and frequency are two of the criteria that may require more optimization to further improve the efficacy of cp therapy for covid-19 moreover with regard to selecting the cp donor the adequate titer of igg and neutralization antibodies should be standardized and a robust donation program needs to be in place to make cp therapy a more viable treatment option for covid-19 early intervention at the onset of symptoms should also be considered as an important factor in enhancing the success rate of cp therapy for the treatment of covid-19 patients this is based on the observation that a better treatment outcome was achieved in sars patients who were given cp before 14 days post infection thus underlining the significance of early time administration of this therapy transfusion-related acute lung injury and infection enhancement that could occur due to subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies could be some of the major drawbacks of cp if these are not considered during the course of treatment relationship between sars-cov-2 rna reduction and cp therapy the optimal concentration of neutralizing antibodies required for effective treatment and dynamic changes of different cytokine during treatment are some of the key parameters that once defined can further narrow the gap that exists for this therapeutic option  cell-based therapies particularly stem cell therapies have become a promising therapeutic approach to treat various diseases for which treatment has proven difficult a few decades ago researchers made the important observation that stem cells including pluripotentmultipotent cells were resistant to viral infection due to the expression of specific genes such as interferon-gamma-stimulated genes 64 for example there is direct evidence of stem cell protection against infection from myxoma virus a therapeutic oncolytic poxvirus hematopoietic stem cells can contain the myxoma virus infection while other cells such as differentiated human monocytes b-cells and natural killer cells cannot 65 recently the usa china and several other countries have started stem cell therapy-based clinical trials to treat sars-cov-2 infection table 2 even with the significant progress of stem cell-based approaches limited cell sources immunogenicity and ethical issues remain some of the major limitations mesenchymal stromal cells mscs have received attention due to their source potential low invasive acquisition procedure high proliferation rate and lack of ethical concern mscs can be isolated from several tissues eg adipose tissue bone marrow peripheral blood cord blood dental pulp menstrual blood wharton jelly buccal fat pad and fetal liver and can be stored for future treatment they are easily expanded to clinical volume in a short amount of time and their safety and efficacy have been thoroughly documented in many clinical trials 666768 while multiple clinical trials for the use of mscs to treat various diseases are ongoing so far none of them have been yet proposed for covid-19 treatment a 2016 study investigated the effect of mscs therapy on influenza virus ah5n1-infected mice and found that human mscs reduced influenza virus ah5n1-induced acute lung injury and increased overall survival 69 notably during sars-cov-2 infections the host immune system increases the production of inflammatory factors inducing a cytokine storm that results in excessive production of immune cells and cytokines 34 mscs therapy may inhibit this release of proinflammatory cytokines and owing to the regenerative properties of stem cells they may also improve endogenous repair of injured tissues figure 2 mscs secrete multiple growth factors vegf pdfg fgf tgf- etc that regulate endothelial and epithelial permeability suppress inflammation and enhance tissue repairregeneration 66 recent studies on stem cells ability to alleviate lung fibrosis has also been reported which is a critical pathological factor in covid-19 70 at the same time mscs are also known to exhibit strong antimicrobial effects through the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and proteins ll-37 defensins hepcidin and lipocalins which could benefit in reducing the viral loads as well during the progression of covid-19 7172 thus after the intravenous infusion of mscs a significant population of mscs would naturally live in the lung where they could cure covid-19 via protecting alveolar epithelial cells reclaiming the pulmonary microenvironment preventing pulmonary fibrosis and salvaging lung dysfunction these hypotheses spurred the pursuit of mscs therapy for sars-cov-2 patients a recent study demonstrated that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mscs in seven severe covid-19 patients resulted in improved functional outcomes with observable adverse effects 73 the clinical benefit of mscs should thus now be evaluated in a larger cohort of patients in the future moreover the benefit of genetically engineered modified mscs should also be assessed in covid-19 patients genetically engineered modified mscs have been used to treat several diseases such as cancer myocardial infarction and acute liver failure mscs modifications include over-expression of cytokines chemically engineered mscs physical preconditioning or pharmacological preconditioning 74 one important limitation of this approach is a dependency on stem cell banks for clinical-grade mscs and limited speed of preparation scientific teams have now also begun investigating the prospects of car-t-based immunotherapy for treating covid-19 car-t therapy represents an incredibly promising approach to reprograming t cells by expressing a synthetic receptor directed against the specific antigen to eliminate the virus-infected cells or cancer cells to control the disease progression 75 car-t therapy has already revolutionized cancer immunotherapy especially for the treatment of b cell malignancies 7677 apart from their treatment potential against b-cell malignancies car-t therapies have also shown early encouraging results for chronic hepatitis b virus hbv infection hiv and hbv-related hepatocellular carcinoma in recent studies 7879 the success of car-t therapy against some of these viral infections accentuates their immense potential against other infectious diseases as well since pathogen-specific t cells play a pivotal role in controlling infections this therapy involves the extraction of t cells from the patienthealthy donors bloodstream and after harvesting and expanding the t cells they are reprogrammed to express a chimeric antigen receptor car targeting virus-infected cells figure 3 while the therapy could be cost-prohibitive for treating most types of viral infections it could be a viable option for covid-19 since no other definitive treatment option is available for this disease yet it has been indeed demonstrated that car-t cells can be redirected to target the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 80 these engineered t cells for sars-cov-specific antigen exhibited a functional profile comparable to that of sars-specific memory cd8 t cells recovered from sars-cov-infected patients this initial evidence suggested that car-t cells could thus be pursued for treatment for sars-cov-2 nonetheless the adoption of car-t therapy for clinical application against covid-19 will require managing certain technical obstacles one of the caveats is that car-t cells that stably express pathogen-specific t cell receptors could pose a risk of its proliferation and mediated excessive killing of infected cells which could result in excessive inflammation and tissue injury to overcome this problem engineering of car-t cells could be done through mrna electroporation rather than using viral transduction to obtain virus-specific t cells that will survive only for a limited time figure 3 the use of mrna electroporation has been shown to result in only transient expression 35 days of the car and thus is expected to decrease the risk for its off-target effects 81 this technological adaptation can also reduce the viral contamination that can come from the viral transduction method of conventional car-t cell engineering transient car-t cells could also overcome the common cytotoxicity due to cytokine storm that has been observed after conventional car-t therapy cytokine storm has been one of the pathological manifestations observed in severely ill covid-19 patients which leads to increased lung inflammation if lymphocytes are engineered using the transient mrna transfection approach that keeps them active for a limited amount of time this will likely minimize the potential of cytokine-storm-mediated cytotoxic effects in this context the dosing regimen and timing of administration of car-t cells should also be carefully assessed to rule out its possible cytotoxic effect for covid-19 treatment unarguably the best long-term strategy to curb the scale of the humanitarian and economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic is to develop an effective vaccine that can prevent the new infections and stop the transmission of the disease the scientific community and the vaccine industry have responded urgently to this epidemic of sars-cov-2 to support the development of vaccines against covid-19 the demand of the situation and the availability of multiple vaccine technology platforms has also accelerated the development of many candidate covid-19 vaccines at unprecedented rapidity and some of these candidates have already entered human clinical testing the pipeline of vaccines against covid-19 has already reached more than 100 confirmed active candidate vaccines though most of them are at exploratory or preclinical stages as of june 4 2020 10 candidate vaccines that have made it to clinical stage represent diverse platforms including mrna dna adenovirallentiviralbacterial vector-based vaccines and inactivated sars-cov-2 82 dna and mrna-based platforms offer the advantage of flexibility in terms of antigen manipulation and manufacturing speed dna and mrna vaccines allow changing the antigen coding gene sequence in order to address the frequent mutations in the antigenic epitopes 83 by comparing the genetic similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov a set of sars-cov-derived b cell and t cell epitopes that exactly match sars-cov-2 have also been identified recently 84 as no mutations have been observed in the identified epitopes among the available sars-cov-2 genetic sequences immune targeting of these epitopes for future vaccine candidates can also counteract the issue of genetic variations of the target antigen currently there are no licensed dnamrna vaccines for use in humans but a few vaccines developed on these platforms have demonstrated potent immunity against various infectious disease targets and cancer in experimental animal models 85 while enhanced delivery technologies such as electroporation and liposomes have increased the efficacy of dna vaccines in humans a shift towards rna vaccine is clearly seen in the recent past non-infectious nonintegrating natural degradation egg and cell-free safety are some of the major safety advantages for mrna vaccines over vector-based or dna vaccines 86 mrna vaccines have also been found to stimulate a much broader range of innate and adaptive immune responses which is desired against covid-19 phase 2 clinical trials investigating an mrna vaccine sars-cov-2 mrna-1273 developed by moderna have begun and phase 3 trials are scheduled to begin soon 87  adenoviral ad vector vaccines also represent a promising modern vaccine platform as a variety of ad vector vaccines have reached human clinical trials for infectious disease and cancer 88 since first-generation adenovirus platforms ad5 have the disadvantage of induction of adenovirus neutralizing antibodies a second-generation adenovirus vaccine platform with four deletions enabling multiple homologous doses is being used to develop covid-19 vaccine 8990 specific targeting of an adenovirus to dendritic cells has been found to be very critical for the efficacy of the ad vector-based vaccine 91 the replication-deficient feature of ad vector vaccines is its key biologic property and they have had an excellent safety profile in clinical translation so far ad vector vaccines can also be easily grown to high titer in cell culture thereby facilitating their manufacture regulatory approval and clinical translation in a rapid manner 92 apart from that the ad vector vaccine also allows for the insertion of multiple transgenes including not only the antigen of interest but also other genes that can enhance the response to vaccination cansino biologics and the academy of military medical sciences china have developed a nonreplicating adenovirus serotype 5 ad5 vector carrying the gene for the sars-cov-2 spike protein and clinical trials are underway in wuhan china 8793 at the university of oxford uk phase 12 clinical trials using a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine chadox1 carrying the gene for the sars-cov-2 protein are underway 3 dendritic cellsantigen-presenting cells modified with the lentiviral vector which expresses viral proteins and immune-modulatory genes is also a new vaccine platform being evaluated in clinical trials currently for covid-19 nct04276896 under this platform dcsapcs carrying a synthetic minigene of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease of sars-cov-2 within the lentiviral vector is administered together with antigen-specific cytotoxic t cells while there are fewer preclinical data and public information available about this platform phase i and ii clinical trials are already underway to evaluate the anti-covid-19 efficacy of these to lentiviral-based cell vaccines and we can expect to see the results of these trials soon some studies also suggest that vaccines for other diseases may confer resistance to sars-cov-2 two recent reports suggested a correlation between bacille calmette-gurin bcg antituberculosis-vaccinated countries and reduced mortality in covid-19 patients 9495 bcg is known to provide nonspecific protective effects through boosting innate immunity to treat malignancies such as bladder cancer melanoma lymphoma and leukemia specifically bcg may augment the first line of immune defense so-called trained immunity to provide a better defense against bacterial parasitic and viral infection 96 clinical trials in the netherlands led by dr mihai g netea 97 nct04328441 and in australia led by dr nigel curtis nct04327206 investigating the protection of bcg vaccines against the sars-cov-2 virus are ongoing some of the recombinant bcg candidate vaccines that have shown a better protection profile in early preclinical and clinical studies could be other potential candidates to explore for covid-19 9899100 moreover since the immunity of the bcg vaccine is not known to last more than 1015 years revaccination of adults with bcg or recombinant bcg strains is another viable approach to consider especially in countries where bcg is given at birth we have curated the list of other vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 from multiple journal sources that have recently moved into clinical trials as mentioned in table 3 31193 in summary drug repurposing plasma and stem cell therapies and vaccines are pharmaceutical interventions that are being actively explored to limit the transmission of sars-cov-2 infection an early clinical priority is to contain the spread of the infection via diagnostics that detect sars-cov-2 infection rapidly and accurately a vaccine or drug that prevents future infections is another early priority there are few potential sars-cov-2 drug and vaccine candidates for clinical trials in the pipeline globally however all promising treatment strategies should be investigated for efficacy and safety moving forward  progress and prospects on vaccine development against sars-cov-2 jinyong zhang hao zeng jiang gu haibo li lixin zheng quanming zou   in december 2019 a cluster of patients with pneumonia surfaced in wuhan china the culprit was quickly identified as a beta-coronavirus that has never been reported before and the virus was named by who as sars-cov-2 12 by march 26 2020 more than 80000 people in china had been confirmed to be infected with the pathogen and among them 3293 people died from the infection under the aggressive control measures implemented by the chinese government the severe domestic epidemic seems to have been effectively contained however a global outbreak has caused more than 460000 confirmed cases in more than 190 other countries making the sars-cov-2 pandemic a general public health event that has stirred up worldwide attention sars-cov-2 is a positive-strand rna virus that belongs to the group of betacoronaviruses the genome of sars-cov-2 is approximately 29700 nucleotides long and shares 795 sequence identity with sars-cov 3 it has a long orf1ab polyprotein at the 5 end which encode 15 or 16 non-structural proteins the 3 end of the genome encodes 4 major structural proteins including the spike s protein nucleocapsid n protein membrane m protein and the envelope e protein 4 as shown in figure 1 sars-cov-2 binds to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 on host cell for the virus entry and subsequent pathogenesis 5 resulting in severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever cough and shortness of breath and severe cases can be fatal 6 vaccines are the most effective and economical means to prevent and control infectious diseases 7 the development of an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 infection is urgently required so far more than 40 pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions worldwide have launched their programs on vaccine development against sars-cov-2 herein we will summarize the recent progress on this vaccine development worldwide in particular on candidate antigens adjuvants evaluation models and technologies used in related research the whole cell antigens wca contain all the elements of the virus including proteins lipids polysaccharide nucleic acids and some other components wca has been used for developing whole-cell killed and live-attenuated vaccines 89 given the complex compositions of wca it is unavoidable to face more difficulties in quality control and consistency evaluation so far several institutions have successfully isolated the virus strains of sars-cov-2 and started whole-cell killed or live-attenuated vaccine development however research on the type of vaccine requires stringent screening for obtaining strains with assured low or no pathogenicity 10 full-length proteins are likely to maintain the correct conformation of the protein capable of providing more epitopes and exhibiting higher immunogenicity pallesen et al 19 demonstrated that higher titer of neutralizing antibodies in balbc mice immunized with recombinant prefusion mers-cov s protein another research confirmed that s protein produced in baculovirus insect cells was able to assemble into nanoparticles mice immunized with these nanoparticles formulated with alum adjuvant that produced high titer of neutralizing antibodies 20 muthumani et al 21 reported that dna vaccine encoding mers-cov s protein was immunogenic in mice camels and rhesus macaques animals immunized with the dna vaccine show reduced typical clinical symptoms including pneumonia during the infection so far clover biopharmaceuticals had announced that they have constructed a sars-cov-2 s protein trimer vaccine s-trimer by using its patented trimer-tag technology and this vaccine will be produced via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system further preclinical safety and analysis will be launched within the next 68 weeks since the rbd of s protein directly interacts with the ace2 receptor on host cells rbd immunization induced specific antibodies may block this recognition and thus effectively prevent the invasion of the virus as a matter of fact most of sars-cov-2 subunit vaccines currently under development use rbd as the antigen moreover the rbd domain was also used in the development of sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines for example studies have demonstrated that recombinant rbd consists of multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes that can induce high titer of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov 22 lan et al 23 reported that rhesus macaques immunized with the recombinant rbd formulated with alum adjuvant could produce neutralizing antibodies in association with observed mitigation of the clinical symptoms during mers-cov infection nyon et al 24 also reported that hcd26dpp4 transgenic mice immunized with rbd fused to fc elicited neutralizing antibodies and were capable of protecting mers-cov infection further rbd domain is relatively conserved as compared with s1 subunit and was reported to contain multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes 25 making it more suitable for vaccine development similar to rbd the n-terminal domains ntd of s protein from several coronaviruses were reported to show carbohydrate receptor-binding activity for example the ntd of spike protein form transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev was reported to bind sialic acid via ntd 26 the carbohydrate-binding properties of ibv m41 strain are also related to the ntd of the s protein 27 thus this domain is also a candidate antigen for vaccine development one study reported that rntd of s protein from mers-cov induced potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and was protective against the viral challenge 28 there is a report that a mab that binds to the n-terminal domain ntd of the mers-cov s1 subunit showed efficient neutralizing activity against the wild-type mers-cov strain emc2012 29 this result showed that ntd specific antibodies are functional in neutralization however as the genomes of coronaviruses are highly variable it is better to use antibodies targeting different epitopes to avoid immune escape of the virus although the function of s1-ntd of sars-cov-2 has not been elucidated it may also be involved in the binding of certain receptors and can also serve as a candidate antigen the s1 subunit which contains both rbd and ntd described above is mainly involved in the s protein binding to the host receptor it is also widely used in vaccine development wang et al 30 reported that mers-cov s1 protein formulated with mf59 adjuvant protected hdpp4 transgenic mice against lethal virus challenge and the protection correlated well with the neutralizing antibody titer adney et al 31 confirmed that immunization with adjuvanted s1 protein reduced and delayed virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels and complete protection was observed in alpaca against mers-cov challenge the fp domain of the s2 subunit is involved in the membrane fusion of the virus which is also a key step in viral pathogenicity 32 therefore it may also serve as a vaccine candidate antigen at present tianjin university has constructed an rbd-fp fusion protein and high titer of antibodies was detected in mice immunized with this fusion protein and the efficacy is under evaluation the n protein is the most abundant protein in coronavirus and it is normally highly conserved with a molecular weight of about 50 kda n protein has multiple functions including formation of nucleocapsids signal transduction virus budding rna replication and mrna transcription 33 this protein was reported to be highly antigenic 89 of patients who developed sars produced antibodies to this antigen 34 dna vaccine encoding sars-cov n protein generated strong n-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated c57bl6 mice and was capable of significantly reducing the titer of challenging vaccinia virus 35 meanwhile some other researchers reported that the n protein of avian infectious bronchitis virus is associated with the induction of ctls that correlated with a decrease in clinical signs and viral clearance from lungs suggesting cellular response is essential in n protein mediated protection 3637 in contrast another research indicated that the n protein immunization did not make a significant contribution to a neutralizing antibody response and provided no protection to infection in hamsters 38 these results suggest that there is controversy about whether this protein could be used for vaccine development anyhow there is no doubt that it can be used as a marker in diagnostic assays due to its high immunogenicity m protein is a trans-membrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 25 kda and is involved in virus assembly and this protein is the most abundant protein on the surface of sars-cov 39 it was reported that immunization with the full length of m protein is able to elicit efficient neutralizing antibodies in sars patients 40 immunogenic and structural analysis also indicated that the trans-membrane domain of the m protein contains a t cell epitope cluster that is able to induce a strong cellular immune response 41 m protein is also highly conserved in evolution among different species 39 therefore it may be used as a candidate antigen for developing sars-cov-2 vaccine compared with s n and m protein e protein is not suitable for use as an immunogen for one reason it consists of 76109 amino acids in different coronaviruses with channel activity thus the immunogenicity is limited studies have shown that sars-cov e protein is an important virulence factor and the secretion of inflammatory factors il-1 tnf and il-6 are significantly reduced after knocking out e protein 42 whole-cell killed or live-attenuated vaccines present multiple antigenic components to the host and can thus potentially induce diverse immunologic effectors against pathogen 43 they are traditional vaccines with mature preparatory technology and may become the first sars-cov-2 vaccine put into clinical applications currently several research institutions have started related research the chinese centers for disease control and prevention wuhan institute of virology chinese academy of sciences zhejiang university and several other institutions have successfully isolated the virus strains of sars-cov-2 and started relevant vaccine development besides codagenix inc announced the collaboration with the serum institute of india ltd to develop a live-attenuated vaccine against sars-cov-2 they use viral deoptimization to synthesize rationally designed live-attenuated vaccines this technology starting with the sequence of the viral genome and allows for the rapid generation of multiple vaccine candidates against the virus subunit vaccines include one or more antigens with strong immunogenicity capable of efficiently stimulating the host immune system in general this type of vaccine is safer and easier to produce but often requires the addition of adjuvants to elicit a strong protective immune response so far several institutions have initiated programs on the sars-cov-2 subunit vaccine and almost all of them use the s protein as antigens for example the university of queensland is developing a subunit vaccine based on the molecular clamp technology 44 clover biopharmaceuticals inc revealed that they are developing a vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 using the trimer-tag technology 45 and the trimeric s protein subunit vaccine candidate was produced via a mammalian cell expression system novavax inc announced that they had produced multiple nanoparticle vaccine candidates based on s protein and now is assessing efficacy in animal models to identify an optimal vaccine candidate for human testing besides johnson  johnson pasteur institute and chongqing zhifei biological products co ltd also started subunit vaccine development against sars-cov-2 with the development and maturing of mrna synthesis modification and delivery technology the research on mrna vaccine has regained attention during the last two decades mrna vaccines represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches because of their high potency short production cycles low-cost manufacturing and safe administration 46 the procedures of mrna vaccine development include the selection of antigens the optimization of sequences the screening of modified nucleotides the optimization of delivery systems the evaluation of immune response and safety test 47 particularly no mrna vaccine has yet entered the market thus it may take more time in quality standards establishment and safety evaluation so far a sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine mrna-1273 encoding s protein developed by moderna has been launched in animal experiments and clinical batch production it is expected that clinical trials will be conducted on 2025 healthy volunteers by the end of april fudan university is in collaboration with shanghai jiaotong university and bluebird biopharmaceutical company to develop a sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine using two different strategies the first is to use mrna to express the sars-cov-2 s protein and rbd domain the efficacy of this vaccine is now under evaluation in mice the second is the use of mrna to express virus-like particles in vivo in addition german biopharmaceutical company curevac ag stermirna therapeutics bdgene therapeutics guanhao biotech zy therapeutics inc cansino biologics inc baylor college of medicine university of texas tongji university also announced their progress on mrna vaccine development against sars-cov-2 dna vaccines are typically comprised of plasmid dna molecules that encode one or more antigens they are superior to mrna vaccines in the formulations needed for stability and delivery efficiency nevertheless they need to enter the nucleus that may bring in the risk of vctor integration and mutations in the host genome 48 so far two sars-cov-2 dna vaccines are under development inovio pharmaceuticals developed a dna vaccine candidate termed ino-4800 which is in preclinical studies and will soon enter phase i clinical trials applied dna sciences subsidiary linearx and takis biotech collaborated for the development of a linear dna vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 which is now in preclinical studies live vector vaccines are live viruses the vector that express a heterologous antigens they are characterized by combining the strong immunogenicity of live attenuated vaccines and the safety of subunit vaccines and were widely used to induce cellular immunity in vivo related sars-cov-2 vaccine research has been carried out by the following institutions houston-based greffex inc has completed the construction of sars-cov-2 adenovirus vector vaccine with greffex vector platform and should have now moved to animal testing tonix pharmaceuticals announced research to develop a potential sars-cov-2 vaccine based on horsepox virus tnx-1800 johnson  johnson has adopted the advac adenoviral vector platform 49 for vaccine development these vaccines contain only certain fragments of intact antigens and are usually prepared by chemical synthesis techniques they are easier in preparation and quality control however the low molecular weight and structural complexity of these vaccines usually result in low immunogenicity thus structural modifications delivery systems and adjuvants are additionally required in the formulation 50 currently researchers from hong kong university of science and technology screened a set of b and t cell epitopes from s and n proteins of sars-cov these epitopes are highly conserved in sars-cov-2 and may help guide experimental efforts towards the development of sars-cov-2 vaccines 51 generex biotechnology announced that they are working with third-party groups to generate peptide vaccines against pandemic viruses using the patented nugenerex immuno-oncology ii-key technology that uses synthetic peptides in mimic essential protein regions from a virus that is chemically linked to the 4-amino acid ii-key to ensure robust immune system activation animal models are essential for preclinical evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines sars-cov-2 is a new pathogen and few animal models are currently available recently one study used the hace2 transgenic mice infected with sars-cov-2 to study the pathogenicity of the virus hace2 transgenic mice infected with sars-cov-2 resulted in weight loss and virus replication in lung tissue the typical histopathology of interstitial pneumonia was observed and viral antigens were detected in the bronchial epithelial cells alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia this mouse model may facilitate the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines against sars-cov-2 52 in addition the institute of zoology of the chinese academy of sciences reported that they observed similar symptoms with human infections in primate macaques including changes in viral load and computed tomography ct images of the lungs the model has been validated and is about to be applied in drug screening and functional evaluation the highly contagious and pathogenicity brings great difficulties for sars-cov-2-related research virus-like particles vlps are multi-protein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic native viruses but lack the viral genome 53 they are safe and effective tolls that are widely used in studying the pathogenic mechanisms of virus infection efficacy evaluation of drugs and vaccines and drug delivery 54 for example the corresponding vlps have been already used to determine the neutralizing antibodies induced by sars-cov and h5n1 vaccines 5556 in the absence of animal models vlps provide an alternative way to evaluate the efficacy of sars-cov-2 vaccines in addition to live attenuated vaccines and live vector vaccines adjuvants are required to enhance the immune response in the development of other types of vaccines in order to accelerate the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccine the preferred adjuvant should be those have been widely used in other marketable vaccines including 1 classic aluminum adjuvant aluminum adjuvants enhances the immune response by facilitating phagocytosis and slowing the diffusion of antigens from the injection site it can efficiently stimulate th2 immune response upon injection 57 2 mf59 mf59 is an oil-in-water emulsion composed of tween 80 sorbitol trioleate and squalene and it has already been used in flu vaccines in europe and the united states the mechanism of mf59 is to create a transient immune environment at the injection site then to recruit immune cells to induce antigen-specific immune responses 58 3 adjuvant system as series adjuvants which are a series of adjuvants developed by glaxosmithkline gsk including as01 as02 as03 and as04 among them as01 is a liposome adjuvant containing 3-o-desacyl-4-monophosphoryl lipid a mpl and saponin qs-21 59 which has been used in malaria vaccines 60 as02 is an oil-in-water emulsifier containing mpl and qs-21 61 as03 is an oil-in-water emulsifier containing alpha-tocopherol squalene and tween 80 it has been used in influenza vaccines 62 as04 is an aluminum adjuvant containing mpl and has been used in a human papilloma virus vaccine and hepatitis b virus vaccine 63 currently gsk announced that they would make its established pandemic vaccine adjuvant platform technology available to enhance the development of an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 and agreements have been reached with clover biopharmaceutical inc and the university of queensland australia because adjuvants were able to regulate the type of immune response the optimal adjuvant should be selected according to the design of the vaccine in order to induce a more efficient immune response a combination of different types of adjuvants could be applied to improve the immune efficacy safety is the most important issue that should be taken into consideration during drug and vaccine development and some scientists urge that we should not rush to deploy covid-19 vaccines and drugs without sufficient safety guarantees 64 for example although s protein is a promising candidate antigen for vaccine development it also exhibits other biological activity besides receptor binding and membrane fusion previous studies have demonstrated that full-length s protein can cause severe liver damage and may result in enhanced infection 14 which was defined as antibody-dependent enhancement ade 65 and this effect may be probably caused by s protein specific antibodies 6667 further there is report that the enhanced virulence mediated by the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain jhm is associated with a glycine at residue 310 of the spike glycoprotein and this mutation may contribute to the spreading within the central nervous system cns 68 however it is not clear which domains and key amino acids in s protein of sars-cov-2 are involved in liver damage therefore the full-length s protein may face safety issues when used as an antigen to solve this problem more basic research should be carried out on the structure and function of this protein and mutants of key residues may be introduced in antigen design recently a phase i clinical trial was launched to assess the safety and immunogenicity of mrna-1273 developed by moderna clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04283461 however this type of vaccines has not been approved for use in human beings before thus the safety is not guaranteed and more assessments should be carried out during clinical trials we know very little about sars-cov-2 there are more questions than answers for the newly identified virus including the etiology epidemiology structural basis mechanism of pathogenesis pathological immune response etc particularly the cellular and humoral immune response of the host in response to the virus infection that are essential for vaccine design remains unclear all these aspects need to be addressed by basic research in the near future for successful vaccine development recently more and more countries and rd institutions announced their program on vaccine development against sars-cov-2 however vaccine development has its own rules and a successful sars-cov-2 vaccine could not be achieved overnight after vaccine design and preparation it will undergo efficacy and safety evaluation quality standard establishment before entering clinical trials generally three phases of clinical trials will be carried out to evaluate the safety immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine typically the development of novel vaccines generally takes 1020 years and the success rate is less than 10 even for a vaccine that enters clinical trials in the past 30 years the us fda has approved a total of nearly 3000 clinical trials on vaccine applications and less than 20 vaccines were approved for the market although the development manufacture and marketing of vaccines are supervised by strict regulations and for the sake of human health we must lay a solid foundation and conduct research in accordance with these scientific laws recently there is report that 149 sites of mutations were identified across the genome of 103 sequenced strains of sars-cov-2 and the virus had evolved into two subtypes termed l and s subtype the study also indicated that the two subtypes showed great differences in geographical distribution transmission ability and severity of disease which add more difficulties for vaccine design 69 currently clinical trials testing different drugs are ongoing and will possibly allow the identification of a potential drug to treat the disease associated to sars-cov-2 and the rapid development and application of a vaccine is a powerful means to prevent the global epidemic of covid-19 although vaccine development is slower than the spreading of the epidemic it is still necessary and urgent firstly the epidemic is still spreading all over the world and more and more confirmed cases and identified and the inflection point has not yet been reached yet secondly sars-cov-2 infection may become a flu-like seasonal disease and coexist with human beings for a long time 70 it should be pointed out that sars-cov-2 was identified in no more than 3 months related research on pathogenic characteristics and mechanisms of this novel coronavirus have just begun and thus the data and information collected are also very limited and need to be continuously accumulated and documented this review also provides the authors own opinions and we hope it could provide useful information for colleagues  immunogenicity of an adenoviral-based middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine in balbc mice eun kim kaori okada tom kenniston v raj stalin mohd alhajri m elmoubasher farag aba farhoud alhajri albert osterhaus dme bart haagmans l andrea gambotto   a new type of coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent underlying a respiratory syndrome that recently emerged in the middle east 1 2 the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses proposed a new name for this novel betacoronavirus the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov several middle eastern countries have been affected by the emerging mers-cov epidemic including jordan qatar oman saudi arabia and the united arab emirates tunisia has reported three confirmed cases of human infection france italy germany the united kingdom greece the netherlands and the usa have also reported cases directly or indirectly connected to the middle east eight hundred and thirty-seven cases of mers-cov infection have been confirmed to date including 291 deaths 3 the rapid accumulation of information about the sequences 2 of mers-cov its genome structure and its proteins open exciting possibilities for the development of candidate vaccines we and others recently provided evidence that dromedary camels are a reservoir of mers-cov virus 4 5 6 7 both mers-cov spike protein-binding antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies have been reported in dromedary camels from different regions including qatar saudi arabia oman and egypt moreover mers-cov in dromedary camels from a farm in qatar were linked to two virologically confirmed human cases of the infection in october 2013 4 and about one in five human cases have been reported to be caused by exposure to animals 8 9 the full mers-cov genome isolated from a qatari dromedary camel is highly similar to the human englandqatar 1 virus isolated in 2012 and has efficiently been replicated in human cells using human dpp4 as entry receptor providing further evidence for the zoonotic potential of dromedary mers-cov 10 although we cannot conclude whether the people were infected by camels or vice versa or if yet another source was responsible increasing evidence indicates that camels represent an important link in human infections with mers-cov intensive vaccine control and risk-reduction targeting dromedary camels might be effective in eliminating the virus from the human population the coronavirus spike protein s is a class i fusion protein cellular entry of the virus has been demonstrated to be mediated by the s protein through the receptor binding domain rbd in the n-terminal subunit s1 and the fusion peptide in the c-terminal subunit s2 11 12 for betacoronaviruses the s protein has been shown to be the main antigenic component responsible for inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies andor protective immunity against infection in patients who had recovered from sars 13 14 and response levels correlated well with disease outcomes 15 16 the s protein has therefore been selected as an important target for vaccine development 17 18 19 20 21 recent work shows that modified vaccinia virus ankara expressing the s protein of mers-cov elicits high titers of s-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice 22 adenovirus 5 ad5-vectored candidate vaccines induce potent and protective immune responses against several pathogens in humans and a variety of animals 18 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 although a trial of a candidate dnarad5 hiv-1 preventive vaccine showed lack of efficacy 37 and the high prevalence of pre-existing anti-ad5 immunity may have been a major limitation 38 in humans replication-defective adenovirus vaccines are among the most attractive vectors for veterinary vaccine development given the relative speed and low cost of development and production most adenoviruses infect their host through the airway epithelium and replicate in the mucosal tissues of the respiratory tracts 39 because of their ability of to elicit mucosal immune responses adenoviruses could be an attractive vector for inducing mers-cov-specific immunity in dromedary camels the putative animal reservoir interestingly sera antibodies against adenovirus type 3 were detected in 13 of dromedaries in nigeria 34 and in 43 of 120 camels in egypt 35 the occurrence of adenovirus type 3 respiratory infections in camels was studied in sudan and a 90 seroprevalence was detected 36 here we describe the development of recombinant type 5 adenoviral vector expressing codon-optimized mers-s and mers-s1 ad5mers-s and ad5mers-s1 as vaccine candidates and investigate their ability to induce neutralizing immune responses in mice moreover to demonstrate the feasibility of using of a human adenovirus 5 based vaccine in dromedary camels we have evaluated the infectivity and the presence of anti-adenovirus 5-neutralizing antibodies in this animal species the mers-s genbank jx869059 gene was codon-optimized for optimal expression in mammalian cells using the upgene codon optimization algorithm 40 and synthesized genscript padmers-s was generated by subcloning the codon-optimized mers-s gene into the shuttle vector padlox genbank u62024 at salinoti sites the coding sequence for mers-s1 amino acids 1 to 725 of full-length mers s according to the genebank database was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the shuttle vector fig 1a subsequently replication-defective human adenovirus serotype 5 designated as ad5mers-s and ad5mers-s1 were generated by loxp homologous recombination and purified and stored as described previously 26 41 42 for detection of mers-s protein expression in a549 cells human lung adenocarcinoma

immunization mice were boosted intranasally in with the same dose of the respective immunogens for the immunization study a protocol approved by the university of pittsburgh institutional animal care

mers-cov neutralization activity of sera derived from mice immunized with ad5mers-s ad5mers-s1 or ad5 vaccines mouse sera were obtained from the retro-orbital plexus weekly for six weeks and tested for their ability to neutralize mers-cov emc isolate briefly virus 200 pfu was premixed 11 with serial dilutions of sera from animal groups prior to inoculation onto vero cells and viral infection was monitored by the occurrence of a cytopathic effect at 72 h post-infection virus neutralization titers vnts were determined as the highest serum dilutions that showed full protection against the

results were considered statistically significant when the p value was 005 symbols    and  are used to indicated the p values 005 0005 0001 00001 respectively e1e3 deleted human type 5 adenoviral vector was used to insert the full-length s and extracellular domain s1 of the codon-optimized mers-s open reading frames to generate ad5mers-s and ad5mers-s1 adenoviral vectors fig 1a to detect mers s protein expression of recombinant adenoviral candidate vaccines a549 cells were infected with ad5 ad5mers-s or ad5mers-s1 and incubated with pooled day 28 sera from admers or control immunized mice immunocytochemical analysis showed expression of mers s protein in a549 cells infected with either ad5mers-s or ad5mers-s1 while no expression was detected in the mock and ad5-infected cells these same sets of infected cells were not stained with pooled sera from mice immunized with ad5 data not shown furthermore cells transduced with ad5-encoding full-length mers-s showed a plaque-like structure which may have resulted from syncytium formation due to mers full length s protein expression while the soluble form of mers s1 protein which was detected intracellularly presumably before secretion showed no syncytium formation fig 1b both the ad5mers-s- and ad5mers-s1-immunized mice developed mers-s-specific antibodies measured as reactivity on a549 cells transfected with pad using flow cytometry while no specific antibody response was detected in serum samples from control animals inoculated with ad5 or with pre-immunized nave mouse sera fig 2
 specific response was slightly higher in mice immunized with ad5mers-s than in mice immunized with ad5mers-s1 769 vs 659 positive cells these data suggest that adenoviral vaccines expressing mers-s and mers-s1 were able to induce s-specific antibodies sera from mice collected every week after in boosting with 1  1011 vp of ad5mers-s ad5mers-s1 or control ad5 respectively were tested for s protein-specific igg2a and igg1 immunoglobulin isotypes indicating a th1- or th2-like response respectively by elisa both igg1 and igg2a were detected as soon as one week after the first immunization the induction of mers-s-specific igg1 and igg2a antibodies were comparable between immunized groups as shown in fig 3a more significantly different igg1 responses th-2 were observed in the sera of mice vaccinated with ad5mers-s1 p
  0005 at week 2 p
  0001 at weeks 3 4 5 and 6 than ad5mers-s when compared with the sera of mice vaccinated with ad5 in fact igg1 levels in the sera of mice vaccinated with ad5mers-s showed a less significant difference p
  005 at weeks 2 3 and 4 p
  0005 at week 5 and 6 in contrast a highly significant difference in igg2a response th-1 was observed in the sera of mice vaccinated with both ad5mers-s and ad5mers-s1 p
  00001 at weeks 2 3 4 5 and 6 fig 3b interestingly mers-s induced an earlier igg2a response than mers-s1 p
  005 vs no significance at week 1 with igg2a titers significantly higher at week 2 p
  00005 but not after week 3 no mers-s or -s1 specific serum antibody responses could be detected within the seven week period in mice immunized with the control adenovirus ad5 these data indicate that ad5mers-s and ad5mers-s1 can induce both th1 and th2 immune responses mouse sera were also tested for their ability to neutralize mers-cov emc isolate even a single immunization with adenoviral-based mers vaccines induced detectable levels of mers-cov-neutralizing antibodies in all animals tested after week 3 of booster immunization animals developed robust levels of neutralizing antibodies while control animals inoculated with ad5 did not fig 4
 in some mice immunized with ad5mers-s1 the highest neutralizing titers were observed as compared to mice immunized with ad5mers-s although no significant differences between the groups were noted this result might suggest that ad5mers-s1 expressing secreted s proteins induced a stronger th2-polarized response which led to a better antibody-mediated neutralizing activity when compared with ad5mers-s fig 3a notably one of the main limitations for the use of adenoviral-based vaccine in humans would be the presence of anti-adenoviral neutralizing immunity in a large percentage of camel populations thus to demonstrate the potential of the proposed use of the ad5mers candidate vaccines to be deployed as a veterinary vaccine in dromedary camels we evaluated the presence of anti-human adenovirus type 5 neutralizing antibodies in this species as shown in fig 5
 no neutralization was detected in 12 sera from dromedary camels which is an encouraging first indication of the potential of this candidate vaccine for dromedary camels to provide further evidence for the potential use of ad5mers-s1 as a vaccine in dromedary camels we determined the susceptibility of dromedary camel cells to be infected by the human adenovirus serotype 5 human or dromedary camel pbmc cells were transduced with recombinant adenovirus expressing egfp and evaluated by flow cytometry analysis for egfp expression as shown in fig 6
 both human as well as dromedary camel pbmcs were successfully infected with ad5egfp moreover a large percentage of the dromedary camel fibroblast cell line dubca were infected by ad5egfp indicating that the human adenovirus type 5 can indeed efficiently infect camel cells fig 6e and f our results show that an adenoviral-based vaccine that expresses full-length or the s1 subunits of the s protein can induce mers-cov-specific neutralizing antibody responses in mice it will be important to demonstrate whether dromedary camels vaccinated with these candidate vaccines or convalescing from mers-cov infection have similar responses and will be protected from mers-cov challenge since this may indicate whether such vaccine-induced responses are indeed protective and future use of the ad5mers-s vaccine as a veterinary vaccine in dromedary camels would be possible previous studies have shown that rbds of sars-cov presenting in the s1 subunit strongly react with antisera from sars patients in the convalescent phase and depletion of rbd-specific antibodies from sars patients results in significant elimination of the neutralizing activity 43 the rbd is the main domain that induces neutralizing antibody and t-cell immune responses against sars-cov infection 44 a truncated rbd of mers-cov s protein was recently reported to potently inhibit viral infection and induce strong neutralizing antibody responses 45 46 sars-cov s and s2 but neither s1 nor other structural proteins can induce apoptosis in vero e6 cells 47 48 and no histopathological changes were observed in various tissues of rats immunized with a recombinant adenovirus containing a truncated s1 fragment of the sars-cov 49 in contrast vaccination with recombinant modified mva expressing sars-cov s protein is associated with enhanced hepatitis after challenge with sars-cov 50 51 and sars-cov has been shown to infect hepatocytes and cause hepatitis in some human cases 51 52 53 raising concerns about the safety of a vaccine that contains the full-length sars-cov s protein a causal relationship between the induction of hepatitis and the full-length nature of the s protein could not be conclusively demonstrated it can be presumed that the s1 gene has less risk for spontaneous recombination with wild type virus following the generation of new virus types thus we believe that an s1-expressing mers-cov vaccine would be a preferable vaccine candidate format however an alternative s antigen format such as the entire s-ectodomain or the s rbd domain could be evaluated for comparison since the capacity of our immunization strategy to protect from infection will require challenge tests in clinically relevant mers-cov disease animal models such as dromedary camels establishment of such a model will also be important to exclude the potential for vaccine-induced immunopathology as seen in the feline infectious peritonitis virus model 54 55 to this end a mouse model for mers-cov infection that was generated by prior transduction of the animals with an adenoviral vector expressing the human host-cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hdpp4 was recently reported 56 this mouse model will also be considered in the future for the evaluation of the protective efficacy of the adenovirus-based vaccines while further investigations are necessary to evaluate the mucosal immunity and the ultimate protective efficacy of ad5mers-s and ad5mers-s1 in dromedary camels or the proper animal models our results demonstrate that recombinant adenoviruses encoding mers-s antigens may be protective vaccine candidates with a safe profile moreover we have also investigated in the present study the infectivity of adenovirus type 5 of dromedary camel cells and the presence of anti-adenovirus type 5 neutralizing antibodies in a limited set of dromedary camel sera altogether the presented studies support further exploration of ad5mers vaccines to target the animal reservoir reducing the risk of human exposure to mers-cov  potential rapid diagnostics vaccine and therapeutics for 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov a systematic review junxiong pang min wang

alex cook r jason yap chin-huat li hsu yang   since mid-december 2019 and as of early february 2020 the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov originating from wuhan hubei province china has infected over 25000 laboratory-confirmed cases across 28 countries with about 500 deaths a case-fatality rate of about 2 more than 90 of the cases and deaths were in china 1 based on the initial reported surge of cases in wuhan the majority were males with a median age of 55 years and linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market 2 most of the reported cases had similar symptoms at the onset of illness such as fever cough and myalgia or fatigue most cases developed pneumonia and some severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome 3 the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov a betacoronavirus forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the orthocoronavirinae subfamily 4 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are also betacoronaviruses that are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to potential fatal illness during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 respectively 56 based on current evidence pathogenicity for 2019-ncov is about 3 which is significantly lower than sars-cov 10 and mers-cov 40 7 however 2019-ncov has potentially higher transmissibility r0 1455 than both sars-cov r0 25 and mers-cov r0 1 7 with the possible expansion of 2019-ncov globally 8 and the declaration of the 2019-ncov outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics to detect prevent and contain 2019-ncov promptly there is however currently a lack of understanding of what is available in the early phase of 2019-ncov outbreak the systematic review describes and assesses the potential rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics for 2019-ncov based in part on the developments for mers-cov and sars-cov a systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases pubmed embase and cochrane library to identify published studies examining the diagnosis therapeutic drugs and vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines there were two independent reviewers each focusing on sars mers and 2019-ncov respectively a third independent reviewer was engaged to resolve any conflicting article of interest we used the key words sars coronavirus mers 2019 novel coronavirus wuhan virus to identify the diseases in the search strategy the systematic searches for diagnosis therapeutic drugs and vaccines were carried out independently and the key words drug therapy vaccine diagnosis point of care testing and rapid diagnostic test were used in conjunction with the disease key words for the respective searches examples of search strings can be found in table s1 we searched for randomized controlled trials rcts and validation trials for diagnostics test published in english that measured a the sensitivity andor specificity of a rapid diagnostic test or a point-of-care testing kit b the impact of drug therapy or c vaccine efficacy against either of these diseases with no date restriction applied for the 2019-ncov we searched for all in vitro animal or human studies published in english between 1 december 2019 and 6 february 2020 on the same outcomes of interest in addition we reviewed the references of retrieved articles in order to identify additional studies or reports not retrieved by the initial searches studies that examined the mechanisms of diagnostic tests drug therapy or vaccine efficacy against sars mers and 2019-ncov were excluded given the rapidly developing and commercial nature of information regarding these developments google search results from the first five pages of each search term were scanned for relevance relevant articles were further identified through snowballing including a search of press releases and grey literature on vaccine manufacturers official websites table s2 a list of potential commercial kits was also provided on 29 january 2020 by dr kim j png personal communication this list was compiled by dr png from web searches and review of latest business news the list served to verify and supplement our teams own search above for review clinical trials was also searched via httpsclinicaltrialsgov to supplement the review of the diagnostics vaccine and therapeutics of 2019-ncov sars-cov and mers-cov an initial search identified a total of 1065 articles from pubmed embase and cochrane library there were 236 236 and 593 articles related to diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines respectively figure 1 after reviewing for inclusion and exclusion and the removal of duplications a total of 27 studies were used for the full review figure 1 a google search for 2019-ncov diagnostics as of 6 february 2020 table s2 yielded five webpage links from government and international bodies with official information and guidelines who europe cdc us cdc us fda three webpage links on diagnostic protocols and scientific commentaries and five webpage links on market news and press releases six protocols for diagnostics using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr from six countries were published on whos website 9 google search for 2019-ncov vaccines yielded 19 relevant articles with the emergence of 2019-ncov real time rt-pcr remains the primary means for diagnosing the new virus strain among the many diagnostic platforms available 10111213141516171819 table s3 among the 16 diagnostics studies selected one study discussed the use of rt-pcr in diagnosing patients with 2019-ncov 11 table 1 the period and type of specimen collected for rt-pcr play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-ncov it was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period it has also suggested that in the early days of illness patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptoms apart from the commonly used rt-pcr in diagnosing mers-cov four studies identified various diagnostic methods such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp rt-insulated isothermal pcr rt-iipcr and a one-step rrt-pcr assay based on specific taqman probes rt-lamp has similar sensitivity as real time rt-pcr it is also highly specific and is used to detect mers-cov it is comparable to the usual diagnostic tests and is rapid simple and convenient likewise rt-iipcr and a one-step rrt-pcr assay have also shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for mer-cov lastly one study focused on the validation of the six commercial real rt-pcr kits with high accuracy although real time rt-pcr is a primary method for diagnosing mers-cov high levels of pcr inhibition may hinder pcr sensitivity table 1 there are eleven studies that focus on sars-cov diagnostic testing table 1 these papers described diagnostic methods to detect the virus with the majority of them using molecular testing for diagnosis comparison between the molecular test ie rt-pcr and serological test ie elisa showed that the molecular test has better sensitivity and specificity hence enhancements to the current molecular test were conducted to improve the diagnosis studies looked at using nested pcr to include a pre-amplification step or incorporating n gene as an additional sensitive molecular marker to improve on the sensitivity table 1  in addition there are seven potential rapid diagnostic kits as of 24 january 2020 table 2 available on the market for 2019-ncov six of these are only for research purposes only one kit from beijing genome institute bgi is approved for use in the clinical setting for rapid diagnosis most of the kits are for rt-pcr there were two kits bgi china and veredus singapore with the capability to detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies respectively  with the emergence of 2019-ncov there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally table 3 in which a wide range of technology such as messenger rna dna-based nanoparticle synthetic and modified virus-like particle was applied it will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi however the kit developed by the bgi have passed emergency approval procedure of the national medical products administration and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of china 40 of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-ncov sars cov or mers-cov vaccines screened only four were eventually included in the review most studies on sars and mers vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models figure 1 the four studies included in this review were phase i clinical trials on sars or mers vaccines table 4 44454647 there were no studies of any population type cell animal human on the 2019-ncov at the point of screening the published clinical trials were mostly done in united states except for one on the sars vaccine done in china 44 all vaccine candidates for sars and mers were reported to be safe well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants in addition we highlight six ongoing phase i clinical trials identified in the clinicaltrialsgov register 4849 table s4 505152 these trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective mers-cov vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet the trials are projected to complete in december 2020 two studies in russia 5051 and december 2021 in germany 52 existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-ncov trials at the time of writing among 23 trials found from the systematic review table 5 there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry clinicaltrialsgov for 2019-ncov therapeutics 535455565758596061 of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol mesenchymal stem cells traditional chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment the remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals interferon atomization darunavir and cobicistat arbidol and remdesivir usage for 2019-ncov patients table 5 besides the six completed randomized controlled trials rct selected from the systematic review table 6 there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at sars therapeutics 92 the studies found from clinicaltrialsgov have not been updated since 2013 while many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavirritonavir or ribavirin only there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the sars epidemic3 in china 1 in taiwan and 2 in hong kong 9394959697 the studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants combination of western and chinese treatment vs chinese treatment in 123 participants integrative chinese and western treatment in 49 patients usage of a specific chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirinlopinavirritonavir usage in 152 participants 98 one randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and chinese treatment during the sars epidemic was excluded as it was a chinese article 94 there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at mers therapeutics 99 it investigates the usage of lopinavirritonavir and interferon beta 1b likewise many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavirritonavirribavirin interferon and convalescent plasma usage to date only one trial has been completed one phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal igg immunoglobulin sab-301 was found in available literature 46 the trial conducted in the united states in 2017 demonstrated sab-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses another trial on mers therapeutics was found on clinicaltrialsgova phase 23 trial in the united states evaluating the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics pk and immunogenicity on co-administered mers-cov antibodies regn3048  regn3051 100 the existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov include a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr b real-time rt-pcr rrt-pcr c reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp and d real-time rt-lamp 104 nucleic amplification tests naat are usually preferred as in the case of mers-cov diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection 102 chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-ncov in the genbank and in gisaid portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus 11 several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in wuhan as highlighted in whos interim guidance on ncov laboratory testing of suspected cases these include protocols from other countries such as thailand japan and china 105 the first validated diagnostic test was designed in germany corman et al had initially designed a candidate diagnostic rt-pcr assay based on the sars or sars-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was sars-like upon the release of the sequence assays were selected based on the match against 2019-ncov upon inspection of the sequence alignment two assays were used for the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene and e gene where e gene assay acts as the first-line screening tool and rdrp gene assay as the confirmatory testing all assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses 11 the hong kong university used two monoplex assays which were reactive with coronaviruses under the subgenus sarbecovirus consisting of 2019-ncov sars-cov and sars-like coronavirus viral rna extracted from sars-cov can be used as the positive control for the suggested protocol assuming that sars has been eradicated it is proposed that the n gene rt-pcr can be used as a screening assay while the orf1b assay acts as a confirmatory test however this protocol has only been evaluated with a panel of controls with the only positive control sars-cov rna synthetic oligonucleotide positive control or 2019-ncov have yet to be tested 106 the us cdc shared the protocol on the real time rt-pcr assay for the detection of the 2019-ncov with the primers and probes designed for the universal detection of sars-like coronavirus and the specific detection of 2019-ncov however the protocol has not been validated on other platforms or chemistries apart from the protocol described there are some limitations for the assay analysts engaged have to be trained and familiar with the testing procedure and result interpretation false negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection transportation or handling also rna viruses may show substantial genetic variability this could result in mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence which can diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results 107 point-of-care test kit can potentially minimize these limitations which should be highly prioritized for research and development in the next few months serological testing such as elisa iift and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods serological testing detects antibodies and antigens there would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset 108 furthermore studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load hence serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests naat are not available or accessible 102 vaccines can prevent and protect against infection and disease occurrence when exposed to the specific pathogen of interest especially in vulnerable populations who are more prone to severe outcomes in the context of the current 2019-ncov outbreak vaccines will help control and reduce disease transmission by creating herd immunity in addition to protecting healthy individuals from infection this decreases the effective r0 value of the disease nonetheless there are social clinical and economic hurdles for vaccine and vaccination programmes including a the willingness of the public to undergo vaccination with a novel vaccine b the side effects and severe adverse reactions of vaccination c the potential difference andor low efficacy of the vaccine in populations different from the clinical trials populations and d the accessibility of the vaccines to a given population including the cost and availability of the vaccine vaccines against the 2019-ncov are currently in development and none are in testing at the time of writing on 23 january 2020 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi announced that they will fund vaccine development programmes with inovio the university of queensland and moderna inc respectively with the aim to test the experimental vaccines clinically in 16 weeks by june 2020 the vaccine candidates will be developed by the dna recombinant and mrna vaccine platforms from these organizations 109 based on the most recent mers-cov outbreak there are already a number of vaccine candidates being developed but most are still in the preclinical testing stage the vaccines in development include viral vector-based vaccine dna vaccine subunit vaccine virus-like particles vlps-based vaccine inactivated whole-virus iwv vaccine and live attenuated vaccine the latest findings for these vaccines arebased on the review by yong et al 2019 in august 2019 110 as of the date of reporting there is only one published clinical study on the mers-cov vaccine by geneone life science  inovio pharmaceuticals 47 there was one sars vaccine trial conducted by the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases both phase i clinical trials reported positive results but only one has announced plans to proceed to phase 2 trial 111 due to the close genetic relatedness of sars-cov 79 with 2019-ncov 112 there may be potential cross-protective effect of using a safe sars-cov vaccine while awaiting the 2019-ncov vaccine however this would require small scale phase-by-phase implementation and close monitoring of vaccinees before any large scale implementation apart from the timely diagnosis of cases the achievement of favorable clinical outcomes depends on the timely treatment administered ace2 has been reported to be the same cell entry receptor used by 2019-ncov to infect humans as sars-cov 113 hence clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected particularly in severe cases in addition most of those who have died from mers-cov sars-cov and 2019-ncov were advance in age and had underlying health conditions such as hypertension diabetes or cardiovascular disease that compromised their immune systems 114 coronaviruses have error-prone rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrp which result in frequent mutations and recombination events this results in quasispecies diversity that is closely associated with adaptive evolution and the capacity to enhance viral-cell entry to cause disease over time in a specific population at-risk 115 since ace2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine coronaviruses are likely to infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and this may influence the type of therapeutics against 2019-ncov similarly to sar-cov however in the years following two major coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov in 2003 and mers-cov in 2012 there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for either disease 116117 well-designed clinical trials that provide the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic measures are scarce no coronavirus protease inhibitors have successfully completed a preclinical development program despite large efforts exploring sars-cov inhibitors the bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase with only a handful crossing the in vitro hurdle stronger efforts are required in the research for treatment options for major coronaviruses given their pandemic potential effective treatment options are essential to maximize the restoration of affected populations to good health following infections clinical trials have commenced in china to identify effective treatments for 2019-ncov based on the treatment evidence from sars and mers there is currently no effective specific antiviral with high-level evidence any specific antiviral therapy should be provided in the context of a clinical studytrial few treatments have shown real curative action against sars and mers and the literature generally describes isolated cases or small case series many interferons from the three classes have been tested for their antiviral activities against sars-cov both in vitro and in animal models interferon  has consistently been shown to be the most active followed by interferon  the use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 synthetic interferon  appeared to have improved oxygenation and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities in observational studies with untreated controls interferon has been used in multiple observational studies to treat sars-cov and mers-cov patients 116117 interferons with or without ribavirin and lopinavirritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in china for 2019-ncov this drug treatment appears to be the most advanced timing of treatment is likely an important factor in effectiveness a combination of ribavirin and lopinavirritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers and may have reduced the risk of infection ribavirin alone is unlikely to have substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages hence ribavirin with or without corticosteroids and with lopinavir and ritonavir are among the combinations employed this was the most common agent reported in the available literature its efficacy has been assessed in observational studies retrospective case series retrospective cohort study a prospective observational study a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial ranging from seven to 229 participants 117 lopinavirritonavir kaletra was the earliest protease inhibitor combination introduced for the treatment of sars-cov its efficacy was documented in several studies causing notably lower incidence of adverse outcomes than with ribavirin alone combined usage with ribavirin was also associated with lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome nosocomial infection and death amongst other favorable outcomes recent in vitro studies have shown another hiv protease inhibitor nelfinavir to have antiviral capacity against sars-cov although it has yet to show favorable outcomes in animal studies 118 remdesivir gilead sciences gs-5734 nucleoside analogue in vitro and in vivo data support gs-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several coronaviruses covs including highly pathogenic covs and potentially emergent batcovs the use of remdesivir may be a good candidate as an investigational treatment improved mortality following receipt of convalescent plasma in various doses was consistently reported in several observational studies involving cases with severe acute respiratory infections saris of viral etiology a significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment of 025 compared to placebo or no therapy was observed 119 studies were however at moderate to high risk of bias given their small sample sizes allocation of treatment based on the physicians discretion and the availability of plasma factors like concomitant treatment may have also confounded the results associations between convalescent plasma and hospital length of stay viral antibody levels and viral load respectively were similarly inconsistent across available literature convalescent plasma while promising is likely not yet feasible given the limited pool of potential donors and issues of scalability monoclonal antibody treatment is progressing sars-cov enters host cells through the binding of their spike s protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and cd209l 118 human monoclonal antibodies to the s protein have been shown to significantly reduce the severity of lung pathology in non-human primates following mers-cov infection 120 such neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by active or passive immunization using vaccines or convalescent plasma respectively while such neutralizing antibodies can theoretically be harvested from individuals immunized with vaccines there is uncertainty over the achievement of therapeutic levels of antibodies other therapeutic agents have also been reported a known antimalarial agent chloroquine elicits antiviral effects against multiple viruses including hiv type 1 hepatitis b and hcov-229e chloroquine is also immunomodulatory capable of suppressing the production and release of factors which mediate the inflammatory complications of viral diseases tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 121 it is postulated that chloroquine works by altering ace2 glycosylation and endosomal ph its anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for the treatment of sars niclosamide as a known drug used in antihelminthic treatment the efficacy of niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus replication was proven in several assays in both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence assays niclosamide treatment was observed to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis reduction of virus yield in infected cells was dose dependent niclosamide likely does not interfere in the early stages of virus attachment and entry into cells nor does it function as a protease inhibitor mechanisms of niclosamide activity warrant further investigation 122 glycyrrhizin also reportedly inhibits virus adsorption and penetration in the early steps of virus replication glycyrrhizin was a significantly potent inhibitor with a low selectivity index when tested against several pathogenic flaviviruses while preliminary results suggest production of nitrous oxide which inhibits virus replication through induction of nitrous oxide synthase the mechanism of glycyrrhizin against sars-cov remains unclear the compound also has relatively lower toxicity compared to protease inhibitors like ribavirin 123 inhibitory activity was also detected in baicalin 124 extracted from another herb used in the treatment of sars in china and hong kong findings on these compounds are limited to in vitro studies 121122123124 due to the rapidly evolving situation of the 2019-ncov there will be potential limitations to the systematic review the systematic review is likely to have publication bias as some developments have yet to be reported while for other developments there is no intention to report publicly or in scientific platforms due to confidentiality concerns however this may be limited to only a few developments for review as publicity does help in branding to some extent for the company andor the funder furthermore due to the rapid need to share the status of these developments there may be reporting bias in some details provided by authors of the scientific articles or commentary articles in traditional media lastly while it is not viable for any form of quality assessment and meta-analysis of the selected articles due to the limited data provided and the heterogeneous style of reporting by different articles this paper has provided a comprehensive overview of the potential developments of these pharmaceutical interventions during the early phase of the outbreak this systematic review would be useful for cross-check when the quality assessment and meta-analysis of these developments are performed as a follow-up study  rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics are key pharmaceutical interventions to limit transmission of respiratory infectious diseases many potential developments on these pharmaceutical interventions for 2019-ncov are ongoing in the containment phase of this outbreak potentially due to better pandemic preparedness than before however lessons from mers-cov and sars-cov have shown that the journeys for these developments can still be challenging moving ahead  the cell biology of acute childhood respiratory disease therapeutic implications gerald loughlin m anne moscona   several abnormal underlying conditions that predispose to severe forms of rsv disease have been enumerated and include prematurity preexisting lung disease and various forms of immunodeficiency however one must understand why some apparently healthy infants and children proceed from initial infection to severe lower respiratory tract disease whereas others experience a relatively mild self-limited illness several groups have recently identified normal genetic variation among humans as a major factor in disease severity specific alleles of interleukin il-4 5 and the il-4 receptor 6 were identified that are associated with more severe disease and promoter variants of il-10 il-9 and tumor necrosis factor  tnf- genes probably also influence disease severity 7 variations at the il-10 gene locus are associated with a severe form of disease 8 ample evidence also exists for a relationship between a locus on the il-8 gene and disease severity 9 10 recently identified variants of the chemokine receptor ccr5 also seem to predispose to severe rsv bronchiolitis 11 and a correlation was established between specific alleles of the genes for surfactant a and d and an increase in disease severity 12 13 in light of this mounting evidence for specific genetic contributions to rsv disease severity and the possibility that similar or related genetic variation may underlie predisposition to asthma and the link between respiratory virus infection and asthma 14 understanding the mechanisms whereby these gene alterations influence pathogenesis will be critical early identification of vulnerable individuals could allow for targeted use of prophylactic strategies to protect those genetically at risk as is currently practiced only for infants with abnormal underlying conditions these preventative strategies could impact not only the morbidity and mortality of ari but also the incidence of reactive airway disease rsv primary infection does not confer permanent immunity repeated reinfection with rsv within 1 year of the previous infection is common in young children although subsequent infections are usually milder suggesting some protection against severe disease after primary infection in adults secretory neutralizing antibodies but not serum antibodies correlate with protection against upper respiratory tract infection whereas circulating serum antibodies particularly against f and g glycoproteins have been shown to protect from infection and decrease progression to the lower airways 15 16 the limited degree of protection offered by maternal antibody is underscored by the fact that the peak incidence of serious rsv disease is seen in infants aged 2 to 5 months when maternal antibody is still circulating within the infant rsv-induced lower respiratory tract disease bronchiolitis and pneumonia results from a balance between cellular damage mediated by the viral pathogen and injury caused by the immune response of the host 17 18 19 although the immunology and immunopathogenesis of rsv infection are not fully understood humoral and cellular components of the immune system clearly contribute not only to protection from disease but also to pathogenesis of disease mouse models of rsv disease have been used to dissect the contribution of different t-cell subsets and rsv proteins to the pathology of rsv infection and have shown different disease outcomes depending on the rsv protein used to prime and the cellular response 20 for example in balbc mice the rsv surface protein g primes for an eosinophilic inflammatory response mediated by th2-type cd4 t cells 21 reminiscent of the responses seen in the formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine model 22 although transfer of cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls to nave mice resulted in accelerated viral clearance immunopathology was also enhanced in mice with very active ctls 23 indicating that ctls associated with th1-type responses also contribute to the immunopathology observed in rsv-infected mice recent studies have shown that the pattern recognition receptor cd14 toll-like receptor 4 participates in the innate immune response to rsv 24 25 26 a response triggered by the f protein as in the animal models cell-mediated immunity in children probably contributes to host defense against rsv but also causes much of the pathologic process and inappropriate immune responses may drive pulmonary inflammation during naturally acquired infection 27 regulation of the response of t lymphocytes to rsv may be critical in determining the clinical outcome of rsv infection abnormal t-cell regulatory mechanisms may be related to a hyperactive ige response which contributes to an enhanced lung infiltrate 28 29 several proinflammatory cytokines detected in respiratory secretions from rsv-infected individuals including il-8 rantes and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip-1 mediate neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis and these cell types can promote host defense and tissue damage the contribution of th1 cells to rsv disease in humans is supported by the findings that interferon gamma ifn is a prevalent cytokine produced by rsv-specific t-cells and that the presence of ifn 30 and the levels of mip-1 31 rather than levels of th2 cytokines have been shown to correlate most closely with rsv disease severity the role of immunopathology in rsv was highlighted after children who had received formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine in 1967 developed enhanced rsv disease on exposure to virus 32 the intense inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs of vaccinated children suggested an immunopathologic cause of enhanced disease animal models have been used successfully to study the immune correlates of pathology and the basis for enhanced disease 29 the overexuberant inflammatory response with lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration has been ascribed to an imbalance in the ratio of th1 to th2 cells that could have resulted from poor preservation of f during formalin inactivation 33 the resulting predominance of g in the formalin-inactivated vaccine was believed to cause a pathologic th2 polarization of the immune response and pulmonary eosinophilia in children who were subsequently naturally infected with rsv cd4 t cells play a major role in the immunopathogenesis of vaccine-enhanced rsv disease 34 a marked increase in th2-type cytokine expression il-5 il-13 il-10 and a reduction in il-12 expression occurred in mice that were immunized with the formalin-inactivated vaccine indicating a swing toward th2 in the genesis of enhanced inflammation 35 the presence of il-5 correlated with an eosinophilic infiltration in the mouse lung in contrast priming with live rsv resulted in a th1 pattern of cytokine production and prevented subsequent enhanced disease 36 a recent study in mice suggests that immune complexes that fix complement also play a key role in the pathogenesis of enhanced disease the augmented disease in mice is mediated by these immune complexes and abrogated in complement component c3 and b celldeficient mice 37 the bronchoconstriction component of the enhanced disease seems to be mediated by complement whereas the enhanced pneumonia component of disease depends on th2 effects these findings which enhance understanding of protective immunity and destructive inflammation suggest important elements to consider in rsv vaccine development 38 successful vaccines must induce neutralizing antibody and cd8 virus-specific ctls and should elicit the cd4 cell response that corresponds to the response to natural infection although live attenuated vaccines can clearly achieve these goals directly they are not appropriate for several populations therefore novel strategies are also being applied to the development of nonreplicating vaccines rsv vaccine development has been hampered in the past decades by the complex factors described earlier the concerns that resulted from the history of the early formalin-inactivated vaccine trials and the limited support for study of pediatric respiratory viruses and vaccine development 38 39 live-candidate attenuated rsv vaccines were never observed to cause enhanced rsv disease and intranasal vaccination with live virus vaccines elicit better mucosal immunity than parenterally administered inactivated virus vaccines therefore developing live attenuated vaccines for rsv-nave populations including infants is a priority however live attenuated vaccines pose the challenge of finding a balance between overattenuation with subsequent induction of inefficient immunologic responses and underattenuation which may result in disease especially in younger infants it is therefore heartening to report that recent advances in molecular virology have allowed a live attenuated vaccine candidate to be developed that is well tolerated in infants and protects against challenge 40 the recovery of infectious virus from cdna clones of rsv 41 42 based on advances in molecular virology during the last decade has completely changed the outlook for developing live attenuated rsv vaccines new vaccine candidates can now be developed by introducing combinations of attenuating mutations into recombinant rsv through direct manipulation of the dna intermediate this new strategy is also advantageous for other pediatric respiratory viruses which are discussed later specific mutations are introduced based on a rationale for their attenuating effects this strategy based on understanding the genetic basis of attenuation and applying it to the design of vaccines is referred to as reverse genetics and will begin to replace the methods of serial passage of viruses or chemical mutagenesis strategies that have been classically used to generate attenuating mutations 43 live cold-passaged cp temperature-sensitive ts rsv vaccines cpts vaccines containing many attenuating mutations were attractive candidates for live attenuated rsv vaccines one cpts the 248404 vaccine candidate was safe and immunogenic in rsv-seronegative infants as young as 6 months but was not sufficiently attenuated in 4- to 12-week-old infants therefore additional attenuating mutations were added using the novel technology and one new vaccine candidate ra2cp2484041030sh contains five new independent attenuating genetic elements in 2005 karron and colleagues 40 evaluated recombinant rsv vaccines in clinical trials for the first time the candidate vaccine ra2cp2484041030sh was well tolerated and responsible mainly for mild illness the lower respiratory tract illness observed was associated with other viral infections administration of a second dose of this vaccine showed restriction of viral replication proving that this vaccine could induce protective immunity consistent with the mechanisms of natural immunity the antibody responses to this live attenuated virus were not the primary mediators of protection induced by the vaccine thus ra2cp2484041030sh seems to be the first rsv vaccine candidate that is appropriately attenuated for young infants including infants 1 to 2 months of age although half of the youngest infants did not show antibody responses the limited replication of the second dose suggests that the infants were protected which is critical because these infants are the most vulnerable and have presented the most challenges to vaccine development this successful trial provides a map for future trials of recombinant vaccines against rsv and other pediatric respiratory pathogens subunit vaccines while not viable for infants and therefore of limited use in the normal population may provide a suitable approach to vaccination in immunosuppressed populations at high risk of severe rsv infection including high risk children the elderly and possibly for maternal immunization 38 one viral surface glycoprotein the fusion protein f has been used as the antigen for developing subunit vaccines purified f protein pfp-1 pfp-2 and pfp-3 these f subunit vaccines have been shown to be moderately immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy seropositive children older than 12 months children older than 12 months who have cystic fibrosis and children older than 12 months who have chronic lung disease of prematurity a meta-analysis of pfp-1 and pfp-2 studies suggested that these vaccines reduced the incidence of rsv infections but not lower respiratory tract infection 44 the pfp-2 vaccine may show more promise in pregnant women in a recent trial it produced fourfold increases in neutralizing antibody titers in mothers and infants at birth and at 2 months of age 45 another subunit vaccine candidate is bbg2na a peptide from the g receptor-binding glycoprotein of rsv that is conjugated to the albumin-binding domain of streptococcal protein g 46 47 this vaccine is well tolerated induces neutralizing antibody responses in healthy young adults and is immunogenic in elderly individuals finally subunit vaccines containing copurified f g and m proteins formulated with an alum adjuvant are being investigated 38 48 however the likely targets for these vaccines will be elderly adults and those at high risk for severe rsv infection until effective vaccines for rsv are widely available passive immunoprophylaxis with rsv antibody preparations is important to protect children at high risk for severe rsv disease a humanized monoclonal antibody palivizumab directed against the rsv fusion protein affords moderate protection to premature infants at high risk for severe rsv disease 49 palivizumab is administered monthly through intramuscular injection during the rsv season duration of therapy and indications for prophylaxis depend on gestational age presence or absence of chronic lung disease and environmental risk factors that increase rsv risk 50 another rsv-specific monoclonal antibody derived from palivizumab medi-524 was developed compared with palivizumab this antibody has an 80-fold greater finding affinity for the rsv f protein 51 is 23 times more potent at neutralizing rsv in vitro 51 and more effectively reduces rsv titers in the cotton rat model 51 52 this preparation is currently in phase 3 trials in children at high risk for rsv and may be preferable to palivizumab in the future similar approaches using other monoclonal antibodies are in different stages of clinical development the role of antivirals in treating rsv infection remains uncertain although some studies have failed to show a correlation between viral load and disease severity others suggest that reduced viral levels correlate with improved clinical outcomes these findings are not surprising considering the significant role that proinflammatory responses play in the pathogenesis of this virus ribavirin is currently the only antiviral agent available for treating children who have rsv lower respiratory tract disease although ribavirin is a nucleoside analog that has good activity against rsv in vitro clinical studies examining its effect in children conflict therefore its use in children remains highly controversial and should only be considered for certain target populations several new antiviral strategies against rsv are currently being investigated including the promising approach of f protein fusion inhibitors the rsv f fusion glycoprotein like the f of all paramyxoviruses mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes during infection 53 54 the f protein forms a trimer during synthesis and is cleaved during transit to the cell surface to produce the final membrane-distal and membrane-anchored subunits the carboxyl terminal of the membrane-anchored subunit of paramyxovirus f proteins is anchored to the viral membrane whereas the newly exposed amino terminal contains the fusion peptide that inserts into target membranes during fusion which occurs at neutral ph 55 initially the paramyxovirus fusion peptide lies deep within the hydrophobic core of the f protein and for the virion to fuse with the target membrane and effect viral entry the f protein must undergo an activation step exposing the fusion peptide 56 for the paramyxovirus hpiv-3 the authors found that the f protein is activated when the adjacent receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase hn binds to a sialic acidcontaining receptor permitting fusion to occur on receptor binding the receptor-binding protein triggers f to fuse 57 58 but must interact with its respective receptor for fusion to occur 53 57 59 60 61 this mechanism has now been shown to be true for paramyxoviruses in general 56 for rsv g the receptor binding glycoprotein must be present and trigger f to fuse
fig 1 contains a schematic of the structural transitions that occur once f is activated and that mediate membrane merger the ectodomain of the membrane-anchored subunit of f protein contains two hydrophobic domains the fusion peptide that inserts into the cellular target membrane during fusion and the transmembrane-spanning domain the fusion peptide is adjacent to the n-terminal heptad repeat hrn and the transmembrane domain is adjacent to the c-terminal heptad repeat hrc the transient intermediate of f that is anchored to viral and cell membranes is believed to refold and assemble into a fusogenic six-helix bundle 6hb structure as the hrn and hrc associate into a tight complex with n- and c-peptides aligned in an antiparallel arrangement the refolding relocates the fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor to the same side pulling the viral and cell membranes into close proximity and driving fusion 62 the refolding step of f provides an attractive target for antivirals the ability of heptad repeat peptides to interfere with the analogous fusion process for hiv has led to a clinically effective peptide inhibitor of hiv infection t-20 enfuvirtide 63 64 65 peptides derived from the hrc-peptide regions of several paramyxoviruses including sendai measles newcastle disease virus rsv and piv5 can interfere with fusion intermediates of paramyxovirus f proteins 63 66 67 68 69 70 71 and can inhibit viral infectivity in vitro 66 67 68 71 72 73 74 75 it has been proposed that this inhibition occurs because the peptides bind to their complementary heptad repeat region thereby preventing hrn and hrc from refolding into the 6hb stable structure required for fusion 56 62 69 in a related approach it was recently observed that the c-terminal of the hrn trimer contains a hydrophobic pocket that provides a potential binding site for small molecules that might interfere with the stability of the hairpin structure 76 and could provide advantages over the use of peptides in clinical use a low molecular weight molecule that is highly effective in inhibiting rsv fusion was recently shown to bind this hydrophobic pocket of hrn suggesting that a small molecule that disrupts the hairpin can derail the rsv fusion process 77 inhibition of the f-triggering process by peptides or other small molecules that interact with the heptad repeat regions is a promising area for development of antiviral therapies and awaits further study several other novel experimental approaches to inhibit rsv replication include the use of antisense oligonucleotides and rna interference technology these approaches although promising are still in early stages of development 78 parainfluenza viruses replicate in the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract and spread to the lower respiratory tract within 3 days croup results from inflammatory obstruction of the airway epithelial cells of the small airways may become infected with resultant necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates the interplay between virus-induced cell damage beneficial immune responses and inflammatory responses that contribute to hpiv-3 disease has not been as well studied as for rsv however as with rsv disease severity is often probably increased and the pathology of clinical disease actually caused by the inflammatory response rather than the cytopathic effects of the virus this fundamental concept is highlighted by the fact that virus titers in the infected hosts are generally waning when disease symptoms become apparent 2 and that virus titer does not correlate with the severity of lower respiratory disease the pathologic changes in children who died from parainfluenza infection suggest exaggerated inflammation 82 83 rather than simply tissue destruction by virus hpiv primary infection does not confer permanent immunity however although reinfection occurs immunity is usually sufficient to restrict virus replication from the lower respiratory tract and prevent severe disease mucosal iga levels correlate with protection from replication of parainfluenza viruses in humans 84 85 cell-mediated immunity also contributes importantly to preventing disease for example hpiv-3 infection in infants who are t-celldeficient can cause a fatal giant-cell pneumonia 84 85 and hpiv pneumonia has a 30 mortality in bone marrow transplant recipients 86 a cotton rat sigmodon hispidus model of disease has been useful in analyzing factors affecting the pathogenesis of hpiv-3 in vivo experimental infection of the cotton rat with hpiv-3 leads to infection of bronchiolar epithelial cells bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia mimicking human disease and making it a relevant model for hpiv-3 lower respiratory infection 87 the authors studied cotton rats infected with either wild-type hpiv-3 or variant viruses containing hn molecules with individual mutations that conferred high receptor-binding avidity or low neuraminidase receptor-cleaving activity 88 the infected animals experienced normal clearance of the variant viruses as opposed to the wild-type viruses however each of the hn protein alterations led to striking differences in the ability of hpiv-3 to cause extensive disease in the cotton rat lung the variants caused alveolitis and an interstitial infiltrate whereas the wild-type virus only caused peribronchiolitis and the enhanced disease caused by the hn variants was manifested by greatly increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in the alveoli and interstitial spaces in the lung this finding suggested that the differences between variants were caused by modulation of the inflammatory response through the different hn protein activity of the variants and are dissociated from viral replication or infectivity the authors hypothesize that mutations in the hn protein that alter either its affinity for receptor or its receptor-cleaving activity may modify the nature of the inflammatory response of the host by using hn variants to dissect the etiology of enhanced disease it may be possible to identify which components of the immune systems response to hpiv3 contributes to disease experiments are underway to determine whether hpiv-3 hn protein alterations that enhance disease specifically alter chemokine expression the results will provide information that could be used to develop therapies to modulate an overactive inflammatory response after hpiv infection the development of a vaccine for the parainfluenza viruses has been hampered by the need to induce an immune response in young infants whose immature immune systems and maternal antibodies interfere with the development of an adequate immune response an inactivated hpiv-1 -2 -3 vaccine used in infants in the late 1960s was immunogenic but did not offer protection from infection 89 90 experimental vaccines are being evaluated and a vaccine for hpiv-3 and perhaps also hpiv-1 is anticipated 91 92 93 94 95 this progress has benefited greatly from the recent advances in molecular virology two different strategies are being developed for hpiv-3 vaccines one is a live-attenuated bovine parainfluenza type 3 bpiv-3 vaccine and the other is a vaccine based on a cold-adapted attenuated strain the bpiv-3 vaccine is attenuated in humans by nature of host range the bovine virus itself when used to infect humans was well tolerated but did not induce similar levels of antibody titers seen in infection with the human virus therefore the reverse genetics approach was used to generate a set of hpiv-3 variants that carry individual genes from the bovine virus chimeric viruses these strains elicited an improved antibody response and in monkeys protected against hpiv-3 infection two of the chimeric viruses one containing the hn gene from the bovine virus in a human virus background and the other containing the f and hn glycoprotein genes from the human virus in the bovine virus background are now viewed as the strongest vaccine candidates for human trials 96 97 98 the latter candidate combines the host range restriction of bpiv-3 with the major antigenic determinants of hpiv-3 permitting efficient replication in vitro which is beneficial for vaccine development along with host range phenotype and excellent antigenicity the bovinehuman chimeric approach is also being used to create a strategy for vaccinating simultaneously against hpiv-3 and rsv and possibly also hmpv the chimeric virus that contains the hpiv-3 f and hn glycoprotein genes in the bpiv-3 background was engineered to also express protective antigens to rsv and hmpv and this strategy will lead to bivalent vaccines against hpiv-3rsv or hpiv-3hmpv using a single virus the bpiv-3hpiv-3 chimera that also expresses rsv f is in clinical trials the hpivs are also theoretically well suited as vaccine vectors for other pediatric pathogen vaccines especially those that use the respiratory portal for entry because the intranasal route of administration is highly advantageous hpiv-3based vaccines would immunize within the first 6 months of life because the virus infects in early infancy whereas vaccines using hpiv-1 or hpiv-2 backbones could be used in the second half of the first year of life taking the strategy of reverse genetics using hpiv as a backbone vaccine one step further hpivs could thereby be used as vaccine vectors for other viruses that infect through the respiratory portal including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and ebola a bpiv-3hpiv-3 virus expressing the spike glycoprotein of sarscoronavirus elicited a neutralizing antibody response and protection against challenge with sars in african green monkeys 99 hpiv-3 expressing the glycoprotein of ebola was highly effective in a guinea pig model 100 and is being evaluated in primates these types of vaccines could be developed to protect children against emerging infections the second attenuated virus being developed for hpiv-3 vaccines cp45 is based on a live cpts vaccine containing many attenuating mutations this vaccine is both well-tolerated and immunogenic in children and infants even those as young as 1 to 2 months 91 93 101 102 and is being further evaluated in clinical trials 93 given the promise of this candidate an attenuated rsv vaccine the 248404 cpts vaccine was tested in combination with the hpiv-3 cp45 vaccine although some interference occurred between the two virus vaccines the results justify further evaluation of combination vaccines 101 several features of the viral lifecycle make parainfluenza viruses vulnerable to attack 
fig 2 the parainfluenza viruses enter their target cell by binding to a receptor molecule and then fusing their viral envelope with the cell membrane to gain access to the cytoplasm because binding and fusion are critical steps for infection to proceed interfering with these critical processes at the entry stage of the viral lifecycle would prevent disease the hpiv-3 f protein was found to be fully activated only when the adjacent receptor-binding protein hn binds to sialic acidcontaining receptor permitting fusion to occur on receptor binding hn actively triggers f to fuse 57 58 61 this mechanism is true for most paramyxoviruses 56 the receptor-binding protein of these viruses including hpiv-1 and hpiv-2 rsv measles virus hendra virus and nipah virus must interact with its respective receptor for fusion to occur 53 57 59 60 61 the authors identified and functionally characterized specific receptor-interacting sites on the hpiv-3 hn molecule 60 103 104 and once the three-dimensional crystal structure of the hn protein was solved 105 they mapped these functional sites onto the hn structure 106 with this information binding inhibitors can now be designed specifically to fit into the binding pocket on the globular head of hn fig 2b 107 108 in addition to interfering with receptor binding by the hn protein this blockade will interfere with the f-triggering function of the hn protein which can only occur when the hn protein is in contact with its receptor the f-triggering function provides a target for several antiviral strategies first based on a recent analysis of the f-triggering process peptides corresponding to the hr domains of f see fig 1 can be designed to prevent the f protein from reaching its fusion-active state fig 2c the authors are performing computational modeling based on the three-dimensional structure of the related parainfluenza virus 5 piv5 previously called simian virus 5 or sv5 f 109 to predict which peptides will be most active and will then test these predictions experimentally this strategy has been effective at improving the design of antiviral peptides for paramyxoviruses 71 preliminary studies in the authors laboratory also suggest that the normal triggering process may be subverted causing the f protein to become activated before it reaches the target host cell and incapacitating f before it can mediate viral entry the authors have shown that specific mutations in the stalk region of hn affect hns ability to trigger f protein 57 and that specific features of the globular head region of hn modulate this triggering function 61 however how the signal for activation is transmitted from hn to f protein is unknown for example if hns receptor binding induces a conformational change in hn how does this change lead to activation of f a more detailed understanding of this pathway should lead to additional targets for interruption of viral entry because hpiv-3 pathogenesis is probably largely caused by the inflammatory response to infection the findings that specific alterations in hn protein correlate with enhanced pathology and that hn may play a role in eliciting inflammatory responses suggest that approaches to modulating the inflammatory response may ameliorate disease fig 2a finally the hn molecule in addition to binding to receptors contains neuraminidase receptor-cleaving activity and cleaves the sialic acid moieties of cellular receptors allowing new virions to be released from the host cell surface and infection to spread although neuraminidase inhibition is unlikely to be as effective an antiviral strategy for parainfluenza viruses as it has been for influenza virus 58 104 110 111 specific inhibition of this activity could prevent virion entry into additional uninfected cells fig 2d these several potential therapeutic targets are being actively pursued with the hope that they will open new avenues for parainfluenza infection interference certainly strategies to protect and treat children with parainfluenza virus infection are urgently needed although significant information about hmpv has accrued in the 5 years since the virus was recognized as a cause of respiratory disease much remains to be learned about the incidence of hpmv in specific populations its basic virology the strain variation and the mechanisms of pathogenesis and immunity little is known about the correlates of immunity to hmpv infection or about the hostpathogen balance in lung disease but features are probably shared with rsv and parainfluenza infection induces serum-neutralizing antibodies in experimentally infected animals and protection against reinfection has been induced through primary infection in several animal models 116 117 118 a cotton rat model was recently developed for hmpv with similar features to the cotton rat model for hpiv-3 118 cotton rats were inoculated intranasally with hmpv the infected cotton rat lungs exhibited the histopathologic changes of peribronchial inflammatory infiltrates and immunohistochemical staining detected virus at the luminal surfaces of respiratory epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract the cotton rats mounted neutralizing antibody responses against hpmv and on subsequent rechallenge with hmpv the animals exhibited partial protection in terms of viral replication and lung disease therefore the cotton rat will probably be a useful small animal model of hmpv infection that as for rsv and hpiv-3 reflects the disease and the correlates of immunity or immunopathology in children 81 87 119 120 this model will now facilitate the in vivo studies of pathogenesis that lead to development of vaccine and antiviral candidates for hpmv vaccine strategies immediately benefited from the advances in reverse genetics and vaccine technology that were developed for rsv and hpiv-3 and allow recombinant engineered viruses to be generated from dna clones of viral genes as a result live attenuated virus vaccine development for hpmv is already in progress recombinant hmpv strains were generated representing rescue of strains from canada strain can97-83 and the netherlands strains nl100 and nl199 entirely from cdna 121 several chimeric viruses were generated that are considered suitable vaccine candidates for example hpmv viruses in which several individual genes the small hydrophobic protein gene sh the receptor-binding protein gene g or the m2 gene or open reading frames were deleted were assessed for their ability to replicate and their efficacy as intranasal vaccines in african green monkeys 122 each gene-deletion recombinant virus although highly attenuated was also very immunogenic and protected the monkeys against challenge with hmpv two of these viruses g-deleted and m2-deleted are promising vaccine candidates 122 in a different recombinant approach chimeras were generated by replacing the nucleoprotein or phosphoprotein p open reading frame of hmpv with the corresponding gene from the avian metapneumovirus subgroup c 123 when tested in african green monkeys immunized intranasally and intratracheally both chimeras were comparable to wild-type hmpv in their immunogenicity and protective efficacy and the p chimera although it exhibited excellent growth in vitro making it feasible for vaccine development was also highly attenuated thus the p chimera could be a superb vaccine candidate that combines good growth in vitro with attenuation in vivo and excellent protection in a primate model 123 candidate vaccines will probably emerge from clinical trials fairly soon underscoring the importance of recent advances in molecular virology of respiratory viruses in accelerating clinical vaccine development cell tropism and receptor use of hcov-nl63 have been recently analyzed 131 receptor identification was performed using the new technology of pseudotyping viruses in which the surface proteins of one virus can be incorporated into the membrane of another viral particle eg hpiv-3 glycoproteins in a retrovirus particle thus binding and entry assays can be performed using the well-characterized and molecularly malleable retrovirus particle the pseudotype allows engineering of any desired variant of the viral envelope protein being studied and provides reporter assays for assessment of the envelope proteins ability to mediate binding fusion and entry to identify the hcov-nl63 receptor the hcov-nl63 spike s protein was incorporated into the membrane of retroviral particles to analyze cell tropism and receptor engagement of hcov-nl63 131 the nl63 s protein was found to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the receptor for sarscoronavirus and to use ace2 as a receptor for infection of target cells potent neutralizing activity directed against hcov-nl63s s protein was detected in most sera from individuals aged 8 years or older suggesting that hcov-nl63 infection of humans is commonly acquired during childhood the facts that sarscoronavirus and hcov-nl63 use the same receptor but differ greatly in pathogenicity and hcov-nl63 infection in children seems to be such a frequent event raise the concern that pathogenic variants could evolve and highlight the need for coronavirus vaccine development investigation into antiviral strategies began in 2006 2 years after the new viral agent was identified 132 several existing antiviral drugs and new synthetic compounds were tested preliminarily as inhibitors of hcov-nl63 and several potential strategies were identified for further study including hr peptides that could interfere with the fusion proteins function and several small interfering rnas 132 identifying common themes in strategies for inhibiting a diverse array of pediatric respiratory viruses eg using hr peptides to interfere with fusion during entry will likely allow advances in the study of one virus to benefit antiviral strategies for other viruses the scientific progress in understanding viral replication entry and fusion for other respiratory viruses will likely benefit the search for antiviral strategies for this newest member of the group of viruses that cause respiratory disease in children cysteinyl leukotriene ltc4 ltd4 and lte4 concentrations were recently found to be elevated in upper and lower respiratory tract secretions from infants who had rsv bronchiolitis 144 145 these leukotrienes play a key role in the airway obstruction associated with asthma by mediating mucosal edema mucus hyper-secretion recruitment of eosinophils and smooth muscle contraction bisgaard and colleagues 146 showed that a 4-week course of the cysteinyl leukotriene blocker montelukast in infants who had acute rsv bronchiolitis reduced daytime cough and increased the number of symptom-free days although this study population included children up to 36 months of age experiencing first-time wheezing a detailed analysis of these data suggests that the effect was most pronounced in the younger subjects an observation that correlates well with the evidence for higher levels of leukotriene levels in infants younger than 6 months 145 146 the study design focused on long-term rather than acute effects and insufficient data support the use of montelukast for treating milder forms of the disease or for relieving airways obstruction in the acute setting as those authors and an accompanying editorial note further investigation in an appropriate study population with documented rsv infection are needed to gauge the benefit of this therapy 147 the observation that secretions composed primarily of desquamated epithelial cells obstruct the small airways in children who have bronchiolitis suggested the use of recombinant human deoxyribonuclease i a treatment that has been effective in patients who have cystic fibrosis in one study of hospitalized infants who had acute rsv bronchiolitis the chest radiographs at discharge showed that recombinant human dnase treatment was associated with significant improvement 148 however therapy did not affect other clinical features such as respiratory rate wheezing and retractions a similar smaller intervention study in more severely ill patients also showed this therapy to be effective in correcting massive atelectasis and avoiding the need for mechanical ventilation in patients who had impending respiratory failure 149 as with leukotrienes more studies are needed to define the usefulness of this therapy this intervention is one of few that focus on addressing the problem of airway obstruction decreased levels of surfactant protein sp-a -b and -d have been reported in infants who have rsv bronchiolitis 150 in mice surfactant deficiency confers an increased susceptibility to inflammation during rsv infection 151 152 if this increased susceptibility is also found in humans identifying infants deficient in sp-a or -d who would be at risk for more severe rsv disease would be beneficial to target for prevention and therapy therefore surfactant replacement is logical not only because of its effect on improving lung function but also because of the potential benefits of decreasing inflammation in a small study of ventilated patients who had rsv bronchiolitis the patients experiencing respiratory failure who were treated with two doses of bovine surfactant showed improved static compliance indicative of decreased hyperinflation and decreased airways resistance compared with the untreated patients 153 no acute improvement in gas exchange occurred but the group treated with surfactant showed improved oxygenation and ventilation indices over the first 60 hours of mechanical ventilation unfortunately surfactant currently must be delivered through endotracheal intubation and therefore this therapy is reserved for children in respiratory failure larger studies are needed to assess the effects of surfactant on the duration of mechanical ventilation and on viral clearance 154 recently briese and colleagues 158 described the development of a masstag pcr for differential diagnosis of respiratory disease masstag pcr is a multiplex assay in which the pathogen gene targets are coded by a library of 64 distinct mass tags the microbial rna or dna is amplified by multiplex rt-pcr using up to 64 primers each primer is labeled with a different molecular weight tag which is attached to the primer with a photo-cleavable link after amplification the mass tags are released from the amplified material with uv irradiation and the identity of the tag is determined with mass spectrometry the identity of the organism is determined from the presence of its two specific tags one from each primer the technology was successfully applied to respiratory disease in its first test case 158 the multiplex primer sets were designed to identify up to 22 respiratory pathogens in a single masstag pcr reaction and the method was found to be highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing these viral and bacterial agents in clinical samples the tests were performed using blinded analysis of previously diagnosed clinical specimens banked sputum nasal swabs and lung washes and the masstag pcr was highly effective at identifying all pathogens including rsv hpiv-1 -2 and -3 hmpv influenza and coronavirus-sars hcov-nl63 was not included in the study this technology probably will be used most immediately in the public health setting for identifying outbreaks and global surveillance as the technology becomes streamlined and mass spectrometry becomes more easily accessible this method has great potential for individual patient management rsv and hpiv antigens can be rapidly identified in individual patients using commercially available rapid screening kits with sensitivities and specificities of 80 to 90 these tests are performed directly on nasopharyngeal secretions using either fluorescent-conjugated antibody or elisa with a monoclonal antibody 155 multiplex quantitative rt-pcrenzyme hybridization assays can identify a panel of respiratory viruses and differentiate between rsv viral subtypes a and b and hpiv-1 -2 and -3 159 160 161 the hexaplex assay prodesse inc milwaukee wisconsin 159 is a multiplex rt-pcr assay for detecting hpiv-1 -2 and -3 rsv a and b and influenza virus types a and b although the sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive values are excellent 159 confirmation with viral culture either rapid or traditional is still important especially with a negative result in an ill child pcr-based technology may provide a useful contribution to diagnosis and subtyping of rsv and hpiv-3 in the future 157 these assay kits and those for antigen detection allow simple screening of children and will likely be used more commonly in the future as more therapies for pediatric respiratory viruses become available however it is hoped that the importance of accurate viral diagnosis gains wider acceptance among practitioners especially during influenza season when prompt specific treatment for influenza can effectively shorten the duration and lessen the severity of disease in children 110 identification of the etiologic agent even if no specific therapy is available is critical in containing respiratory virus outbreaks and avoiding transmission to vulnerable individuals although hmpv was included among the 22 respiratory pathogens successfully identified in the single masstag pcr described earlier 158 clinical diagnosis of this recently identified pathogen is still less developed than for rsv and hpiv however molecular methods have been developed recently 162 163 164 hmpv virus in respiratory secretions is best identified with rt-pcr several of the original clinical reports on this virus used rt-pcr assays that used pcr primers hybridizing to the polymerase l gene and used the l gene pcr product sequence to identify the virus faster and specific real-time rt-pcr tests were developed over the past 2 years that can also detect viruses from the four known genetic lineages of hmpv 163 164 165 diagnostic strategies for hcov-nl63 were developed for use in population studies to assess the incidence of infection with this virus and its association with respiratory disease 130 166 whether hcov-nl63 diagnosis will have a place in practice or whether identifying this agent will be most important in the public health setting is unclear a pan-coronavirus rt-pcr assay was recently developed and used to assess respiratory disease in hospitalized children 166 the original consensus rt-pcr assay which was designed to amplify all known coronaviruses is unable to detect hcov-nl63 because of mismatches with the primer sequences 167 for the new assay the consensus primers were modified based on an alignment with the hcov-nl63 prototype sequence in addition to hcov-nl63 and sarscoronavirus the two other human coronaviruses known to infect the respiratory tract oc43 hcov-oc43 and 229e hcov-229e were included in the optimized pan-coronavirus rt-pcr assay in addition to identifying the specific viral infections sequence analysis of amplified gene segments showed that the hcov-nl63 isolates could be classified into the two subtypes corresponding to the two prototype hcov-nl63 sequences the pan-coronavirus assay was tested not only on the four known human coronaviruses but also on three animal coronaviruses feline infectious peritonitis virus porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and murine hepatitis virus the results suggest that the assay efficiently amplifies a broad range of coronaviruses both human and animal this pan-coronavirus rt-pcr assay could be especially useful for its ability to identify previously unknown coronaviruses  vaccine development against middle east respiratory syndrome hai lee yen mun nyon peak ulrich strych   originating in guangdong province china in 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars became the first pandemic outbreak of the twenty first century the disease caused over 8000 infections and was responsible for almost 800 deaths most remarkably sars quickly became a disease of global importance impacting air travel commerce and tourism while the outbreak was eventually contained using an impressive joint global public health effort 10 years later another human coronavirus cov has emerged as the causative agent of middle east respiratory syndrome mers as of may 2016 there have already been 1728 laboratory confirmed cases of mers in 27 countries worldwide with 624 related deaths 86 of which recorded during an ongoing outbreak in buraydah saudi arabia 1 recurrent episodes like this have impressed upon the scientific community the need to advance development licensure manufacture stockpiling and deployment of vaccines to combat these emerging infectious coronavirus infections 2 in this review the progress in the area of vaccine development for mers-cov is appraised with an assessment of lessons learned from the response to the earlier sars-cov pandemic the coronavirus family received global attention in november 2002 when the first case of sars-cov infection was reported in guangdong province china within 3 months 305 cases with five deaths from respiratory failure had been recorded this subsequently led to the notification of the world health organization who and the issuance of a global health alert as well as travel advisory in retrospect there probably was an initial delay in the identification of this etiological agent of unknown origin which consequently allowed the worldwide spread of the disease 3 the scientific community though was subsequently quick to respond and begin the race towards vaccine development 4 the full characterization and genome sequencing of sars-cov was published within only 2 months after the who had started to coordinate the efforts to determine the epidemiology pathogenesis and transmission of the disease vaccine studies quickly identified the virus spike s protein as a possible recombinant antigen component of a future vaccine and the c-terminal portion of the sars-cov nucleocapsid protein was identified as a likely candidate for improved diagnostics tools a candidate dna vaccine showing efficacy in neutralization and protective immunity in mice had been identified within 1 year of the outbreak 5 vaccine development was fueled by the daunting possibility of a re-emergence of the disease when additional isolated cases of a suspected sars infection scare were reported in china in 2004 6 at that point there were ten human vaccine trials planned using inactivated virus recombinant proteins adenovirus platforms or plasmid dna the trials were planned to take place in various countries including china canada france austria the usa and italy 7 the major hurdle however was the lack of an appropriate animal challenge model that could reproduce an infection similar to what was observed in humans then with the identification of virus reservoirs and mechanisms of transmission the sars outbreaks ended in july 2003 only 4 months after the issuance of the global alert the outcomes of this vaccine development race were summarized in a phase i clinical trial report published several years later two vaccine candidates were developed and analyzed by sinovac and the nihniaid respectively the earliest live-attenuated vaccine clinical trial that took place under a fast track designation approval from regulatory authorities in china was conducted in 2004 8 9 results indicated that serum conversion was observed in 100  of the volunteers who received a low dosage vaccine in the other study a plasmid dna vaccine candidate developed by the niaids vaccine research centre was well tolerated and produced the desired immune responses including neutralizing antibodies 10 none of the candidates though proceeded into phase ii more recently a recombinant subunit-based sars-cov vaccine was produced by the sabin vaccine institute product development partnership based on the virus receptor-binding domain 11 the goal here was to improve safety of the vaccine and cost efficiency of the vaccine development process 12 the vaccine is being produced under cgmp conditions but no clinical trials are immediately scheduled for the middle east respiratory syndrome mers the first case was reported in june 2012 in saudi arabia this isolate was initially named hcov-emc1 and was traced back to a cluster of pneumonia cases in the zarqa hospital jordan in marchapril 2012 in september 2012 a report from the uk about a novel coronavirus london1 was published involving a patient with a travel history to qatar shortly thereafter both isolates were found to be similar and were named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov a betacoronavirus phylogenetically closely related to sars-cov by october 2013 there had been 144 laboratory confirmed cases with 17 probable cases affecting nine countries despite increased global vigilance in part certainly due to the prior experience with sars-cov cases of mers-cov were still reported outside the middle east 3 years after its first emergence the largest of these was reported in south korea in june 2015 13 and was traced back to a single traveler that visited four various middle eastern countries within a month this outbreak involved 160 confirmed patients and placed thousands of individuals under close observation 14 overall it is speculated that the lower number of cases of mers in comparison to sars may be due to the better coordination of notifications early travel advisories the implementation of improved hospital containment measures the issuance of a global alert by the who and better compliance with international health provisions originally drafted in 2007 3 although there is the possibility that mers could potentially follow the pandemic path of sars based on the similarity in phylogenetics the difference in the biology of the virus and its adaptation to human beings are distinct while mers-cov was found to be already circulating in human populations without mutating into a pandemic form sars-cov adapted to human beings within several months showing the complexity of the virus biology the affinity of the mers-cov spike protein for the human dpp4 receptor is lower than that of the sars-cov rbd towards the human ace-2 receptor and thus the pandemic potential of mers-cov has been considered to be lower than that of sars likely not reaching epidemic potential 15 nevertheless there remains valid concern especially since its fatality rate of 36  is much higher than that for sars 10  sars-cov inactivated by means of formaldehyde uv light or beta-propiolactone was able to protect mice from infection in challenge studies 1618 in analogy for mers a recombinant propagation-defective live virus lacking the structural envelope protein gene has been proposed as a vaccine candidate to prevent mers-cov infection 19 the mers-cov genome is approximately 30 kb in size 20 and encodes several unique accessory proteins and four major structural proteins the receptor-binding spike s protein a nucleocapsid n protein an envelope e protein and the membrane m protein 21 the initial expectation that the host cell entry point for mers-cov would be similar to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor used by sars-cov was not confirmed instead the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 receptor was identified as the critical receptor for entry of mers-cov into its host cell 22 dpp4 does not share any structural similarities to ace2 and has a more diverse cellular tropism as it is expressed on the surface of several types of cells 23 while sars-cov specifically targets ace2-expressing ciliated epithelial cells in the lungs 24 25 dpp4 plays a more diverse role including in the regulation of peptide hormone metabolism t cell activation neurotransmitter function and glucose homeostasis 26 notably the mers-cov spike protein exhibits a high affinity for dpp4 receptors from a wide range of hosts including human camel and horse 27 the 193 amino acid residue receptor-binding domain rbd fragment of the s1 subunit of the sars-cov spike protein was able to induce neutralizing antibodies and protect against sars-cov infection in animal models 28 29 using homology modeling the corresponding mers-cov rbd was located between residues 377 to 662 in the s protein 30 several variants of the rbd have since been investigated as vaccine candidates with the s377-588 fragment fused to human igg fc demonstrating the highest dpp4-binding affinity and inducing the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits 31 another rbd fragment s367-606 formulated with aluminum hydroxide alum has been investigated in a rhesus macaque model 32 animals immunized with a higher dose of the vaccine 200100100 g rrbd admixed with 1 mg of alum adjuvant showed less severe pneumonia and decreased viral loads upon challenge with mers-cov compared to a lower dose group 32 recently though a group in korea observed a high mutation rate in isolates of the mers-cov from several patients it was seen that these mutations in the rbd of the s protein displayed reduced binding affinity to their host cell receptor making the virus less virulent than the wild-type but possibly also contributing to the virus evading the host immune system 33 therefore shi et al suggested epitope-based vaccine design to identify highly conserved region that can produce neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity against mers-cov based on the in silico protein antigenic prediction and structure analysis nucleocapsid n protein of mers-cov was the most probable antigenic protein and a number of putative lymphocytes epitope peptides were identified from the n protein 34 nevertheless these suggested epitopes have to undergo comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies for their efficient use as vaccines against mers-cov the use of dna vaccines is based on the transfection of plasmid dna that encodes antigenic proteins into host cells and the subsequent expression of these foreign genes in order to induce a potent immune response against the disease of interest undoubtedly at first glance nucleic acid immunization appears to be an attractive vaccine platform fast vaccine development a clean safety profile and low production costs 35 however in spite of the promising data from pre-clinical animal studies dna vaccines have not yet been fully successful in humans for example the dengue dna vaccine d1me100 showed excellent anti-dengue cellular and humoral immune responses in non-human primates however it failed to produce neutralizing antibody in human subjects 36 37 research and development on mers-cov dna vaccines has been focused on the s protein by engineering plasmid dna that encoded full-length s protein sequences 38 a synthetic dna vaccine against mers-cov was studied in mice and large animal models non-human primatesnhps and camels and the results showed that the vaccine is capable of inducing s protein-specific neutralizing antibodies in these animals intriguingly the study revealed that vaccinated nhps were protected and failed to demonstrate any clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia post mers viral challenge 38 in early 2016 the first-in-human trial of mers vaccine has begun 39 where 75 participants will receive the mers dna vaccine gls-5300 co-developed by inovio pharmaceuticals and geneone life science inc 40 in an alternative approach graham and co-workers proposed to combine a dna vaccine and the s1 subunit protein in a prime-boost scheme rhesus macaques immunized with spike dna vaccine followed by the s1 protein adjuvanted with aluminum phosphate yielded more neutralizing antibodies showed fewer signs of pulmonary disease than animals vaccinated with the s1 protein only 41 a mers-cov vaccine that targets camels has been developed using viral vector vaccine technology with adenoviral vectors encoding the full-length mers-cov s protein or the s1 extracellular domain of s protein pre-clinical studies showed vaccinated dromedary camels had mounted a neutralizing antibody response against mers-cov in vitro 42 guo et al highlighted that the intramuscular route for administering adenovirus-based vaccines with mers-cov s protein could affect the antigen-specific t cell response in immunized mice 43 lately viral vector vaccines against mers-cov have been constructed using modified vaccinia virus ankara mva the mva-mers-s recombinant virus which is genetically stable in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts cef without the need for additional animal-derived components was able to protect human dpp4-transduced mice against mers-cov challenge 44 the phase i clinical trial in humans of this vaccine has been announced and is supported by the german center for infection research difz 45 novavax in collaboration with a team from the university of maryland has produced mers-cov full-length nanosized amphiphilic spike protein aggregates using a recombinant baculovirus construct in sf9 cells when formulated with alum or to an even greater extent novavax saponin-based matrix-m1 adjuvant high titers of neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov but the related sars-cov were observed 46 however no plans for clinical trials have been made public yet 47 another approach towards a mers vaccine is targeting camels one of the reservoirs of the virus according to a cross-sectional serological survey in all 13 provinces of saudi arabia 10000 individuals the seroprevalence of mers-cov antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population 48 scientists from the netherlands germany and spain have shown that a modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing the mers-cov spike protein mva-s conferred mucosal immunity in dromedary camels using a prime-boost approach dromedary camels were immunized intranasally as well as intramuscularly and after 3 weeks challenged intranasally with mers-cov virus while the animals showed the typical mild clinical symptoms of a mers infection in this species a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus particles as well as a reduction of viral rna in immunized camels was observed 49 50 however there is concern that this reduction might not be sufficient to disrupt the spread of the virus or that the vaccination might not provide long-lasting immunity in addition since the disease does not cause any significant morbidity in camels there is perceived reluctance among camel owners to have their animals vaccinated in the first place 51 as an added benefit of the mva-s vaccine though it was observed that the vaccination provided cross-protection against camelpox virus which might the treatment more attractive to the animal owners in order to characterize the viral pathogenesis and evaluate therapeutic options for mers-cov researchers rely on an animal model mimicking the clinical course and pathology observed in humans in contrast to the sars animal model where aged mice displayed pathological changes post-infection 52 mice infected with mers-cov did not show any clinical signs of infections such as weight loss 53 in addition syrian hamsters and ferrets which are known to be susceptible to sars-cov failed to be infected by mers-cov 22 54 non-human primates nhp and common marmoset models have been tested for their suitability as mers-cov models upon a combination of various inoculation routes intratracheal ocular oral and intranasal using an infectious dose of mers-cov rhesus macaques developed a transient lower respiratory tract infection and mild clinical disease without mortality 55 on the other hand mers-cov infected common marmosets developed progressive severe pneumonia 56 although nhps are sufficiently good models to study mers at different severity working with nhps is costly hence establishing transgenic rodent animal models is crucial to move forward in the development of vaccines and therapeutic methods against mers-cov by comparing small animal cell lines transfected with human and hamster dpp4 genes it was observed that only humanized cell lines enabled mers-cov replication 57 therefore researchers have now developed a hdpp4 transgenic mouse model 58 59 agrawal et al cloned hcd26dpp4 in an expression vector with the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer and chicken beta-actin promoter and microinjected the dna into mice zygotes after lineage screening hdpp4 transgenic mice that expressed hcd26dpp4 were fully permissive to mers-cov infection resulting in weight loss and an acute inflammatory response within the lungs and brains of the animal 58 when these hcd26dpp4 transgenic mice were immunized with mf59-adjuvanted rbd fragment s377-588 fused to the fc fragment they were protected after challenge with a high dose 100 ld50 of the virus 60 another hdpp4 transgenic mouse was recently created using an expression vector with either cytokeratin 18 k18 or surfactant protein c spc promoters with the spc-dpp4 transgenic mice exhibiting a milder disease phenotype 59 emerging and re-emerging diseases with pandemic potential are a major driving force for vaccine development for human coronaviruses the pandemic outbreak of sars-cov necessitated the development of a blueprint for a global response to this type of threat as mers-cov reaches the fourth year of its emergence initial technological advances have enabled one dna-based vaccine to quickly enter phase i human trials the process was arguably accelerated by key information for strategic vaccine development obtained during the prior sars-cov outbreak nevertheless the process of bringing a vaccine to the clinic remains lengthy and cumbersome and with new infectious diseases shifting the focus away from mers there is the risk that just as before the vaccine development process remains unfinished and is only picked up again when the next coronavirus emerges  potential adjuvants for the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccine based on experimental results from similar coronaviruses tania gupta shishir gupta k   the sars-cov-2 a member of family coronaviridae and the causative agent of covid-19 disease has spread rapidly around the globe since the first outbreak in wuhan china in december 2019 the world health organization who declared the outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern on 30th january 2020 1 2 3 4 despite the tremendous efforts to contain the virus its spread is ongoing though the majority of cases resolve spontaneously some develop various fatal complications including organ failure septic shock pulmonary edema severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 5 6 7 before the current pandemic highly pathogenic covs have hit the world as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus in 2012 the sars-cov-2 has been identified as a -coronavirus and like sars-cov it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors 8 9 recent data on genome sequencing of sars-cov-2 revealed that it shares approximately 796 similarity with sars-cov at the nucleotide level 9 which varies between the different genes sars-cov-2 contains a linear single-stranded positive-sense rna as genetic material that encodes for the spike s envelop e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins 10 the spike protein that binds to host cell receptors shares about 72 nucleotide similarity between these two 8 11 12 13 the s protein consists of two subunits s1 and s2 s1 interacts with the surface receptor and s2 helps in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes and subsequent entry of the virus into the host cells different coronaviruses depending upon the viral species use different receptor binding domains rbd present on the s1 subunit to interact with host cell receptors 8 9 while rbd of mers-cov recognizes non-acetylated sialoside attachment receptors human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 14 15 sars-cov interacts with ace2 receptors 16 however sars-cov-2 as compared to sars-cov contains different amino acids five amino acids out of six are mutated composition in its rbd that are crucial for receptor binding ace2 with high affinity 17 and has a functional polybasic furin site at s1-s2 boundary that may have a role in defining the viral infectivity and host range 18 19 the furin cleavage site is not reported in sars-cov and its fusion to membrane involves either direct receptor-mediated fusion or receptor-mediated endocytosis 20 the high-affinity binding of sars-cov-2 with ace2 receptor along with the presence of furin and tmprss2 at s2 cleavage sites explain its rapid spread and strong ability for human to human transmission 21 currently there is no specific anti-viral medicine or vaccine available for the disease however many studies and clinical trials are being undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of various drugs and vaccine candidates 22 as sars-cov-2 share significant similarities with sars and mers coronaviruses and use similar spike protein for receptor binding the key information from the past vaccine studies with such similar viruses may help accelerate the development of an effective therapyvaccine against covid-19 vaccine candidates against sars-cov have been tested in many studies and include inactivated whole virus vaccine recombinant spike s protein preparations virus-like particles vlps plasmid dna and several viral vectors containing genes for sars-cov proteins figure 1
 23 24 25 many of such vaccine candidates efficiently induced the production of neutralizing antibodies such antibodies target the spike protein of the coronavirus so it cannot bind to its cellular receptor and consequently it cannot enter the cell however there are a few basic constraints to vaccine development the key factor in vaccine design is ensuring the efficacy of the vaccine while reducing the potential risks associated with it the inactivated virus vaccine may not elicit an ideal immune response to confer protective immunity and may require multiple booster doses similarly new generation vaccines that contain recombinant viral proteins need help from immunostimulatory molecules 26 27 further as with other rna viruses these covs go through frequent recombination therefore a live attenuated vaccine carries the inherent risk of reversal to a virulent form and may pose a severe threat to human lives ideally a vaccine against a highly pathogenic virus including covs should be able to generate a protective antibody response to the minimum antigen dose in a quick time with no adverse reactions the covid-19 is spreading globally and infecting a large number of people due to the lack of any prophylactic measure the demand for the vaccine once available will be overwhelming and therefore highly desirable for a potential vaccine to be able to induce immunity in a short time with the minimum quantity of the antigen required this will make it affordable and help meet the high global demands 28 29 most of the above issues may be resolved by incorporating a suitable adjuvant in vaccine preparations which will not only help in eliciting a robust immune response but also possibly reduce the antigen quantity and the need for multiple doses of vaccine thus the selection of an effective adjuvant becomes crucial for the development of an adjuvanted vaccine against covid-19 the past vaccine studies on similar covs with various adjuvant combinations may provide key information and help in picking adjuvants which possess a good safety profile and efficacy therefore in this review we discuss the past adjuvanted vaccine studies and their outcomes with similar covs which might be useful in developing an adjuvanted vaccine against covid-19 further we briefly discuss the current progress in the development of adjuvanted vaccines against covid-19 aluminum hydroxide alum is the most commonly used agent as an adjuvant the mechanism of its adjuvant action is complex and so far multiple hypotheses have been put forward to explain its mode of action 152 it has been shown to act by depot formation at the site of injection allowing for a slow release of antigen this prolongs the interaction time between antigen and antigen-presenting cells apcs further it converts soluble antigens into particulate forms which are readily phagocytosed 30 at the cellular level aluminum hydroxide directly stimulates monocytes to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines activating t cells activated th2 cells release il-4 which in turn can induce an increase in the expression of mhc class ii molecules on monocytes 31 alum has been approved as an adjuvant in multiple licensed vaccines for human use in the majority of the countries worldwide table 1
 32 33 mice immunized with uv-inactivated sars-cov particles elicited a high level of humoral immunity that resulted in the generation of long-term antibody-secreting and memory b cells further the addition of alum to the vaccine formula significantly augmented serum igg and reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice 34 the antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins and neutralized the virus tang et al 35 using inactivated sars-cov with or without alum adjuvant in female balbc mice demonstrated that the antibodies to sars-cov were induced by the adjuvanted vaccine were higher than those without adjuvant in non-human primates nhps purified inactivated sars-cov vaccine with and without alum when administered in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques protected the monkeys from the challenge of sars-cov without causing any adverse reactions table 2
 similarly an inactivated mers-cov vaccine adjuvanted with alum plus cpg protected the ad5-hdpp4 transduced mice 36 37 38 though studies reported the safe use of inactivated viral particles as a vaccine a few reports observed the occurrence of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease ade and immunopathological changes in the lungs in response to live viral challenge after immunization with inactivated virus vaccine 39 40 41 further studies attributed the occurrence of immunopathological changes or ade to the presence of anti-n antibodies or non-neutralizing antibodies antibody isotype low affinity or suboptimal levels of neutralizing antibodies induced by immunization with an inactivated virus vaccine alone or with alum 41 42 43 44 inclusion of an adjuvant that favors a predominantly th1 response to the whole virus inactivated vaccine may alleviate the issue of th2-type immunopathology 38 41 45 these points must be taken into consideration while proceeding with the development of the adjuvanted covid-19 vaccine using the inactivated virus recombinant subunit or newer generation vaccines have drawn a lot of attention in recent times a truncated version of sars-cov s glycoprotein containing only the ectodomain that was cloned and expressed in a serum-free insect cell line when injected into the mice along with alum induced significantly higher levels of viral neutralizing antibodies with fewer doses and a lower concentration of s glycoprotein 46 47 full-length recombinant spike protein plus alum preparations were as immunogenic as virus-like particles vlps containing the spike protein and the influenza m1 protein both vaccines resulted in the induction of strong neutralizing antibodies that protected against lethal challenge in a mouse model 48 chimeric vlps consist of sars-cov s protein and e m and n proteins of mouse hepatitis virus were prepared and tested in balbc mice against the sars-cov challenge 49 the addition of alum adjuvant in the chimeric vlps enhanced the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protected the mice from the sars-cov challenge mers-cov and sars-covs full-length spike nanoparticles in combination with adjuvants alummatrix m were able to produce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice 50 the rbd protein variants in deglycosylated form to scale-up production of the rbd vaccine candidate were expressed as recombinant proteins in yeast the alum adjuvanted preparation induced significantly stronger rbd-specific antibody responses and a higher level of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov 51 similarly alum adjuvanted mers-cov nanoparticles and recombinant mers-cov rbd protein vaccines could elicit neutralizing antibodies and protect the rhesus macaques table 3

 mf59 is an oil-in-water type immunogenic adjuvant which consists of squalene and two surfactants tween 80 and span 85 the mf59 is a safe well-tolerated and potent adjuvant that has been used in pandemic focetria and celtura and seasonal influenza fluad vaccines in many countries table 1 54 55 the inclusion of the mf59 adjuvant in the influenza vaccine has been reported to induce higher levels of antigen-specific antibody levels higher hai titers hemagglutination inhibiting and better protection 56 57 58 though it favors th2-type response like alum mf59 activates more cd4 t cells and produces higher antibody tiers against the ha hemagglutinin of the influenza virus 59 the mf59 has been tested as an adjuvant with many other vaccines against bacteria and viruses including sars-cov immunization with inactivated sars-cov vaccine adjuvanted with mf59 protected mice from challenge with the virus the vaccine was able to elicit neutralizing antibodies after only 2 doses 60 subunit vaccines based on s1 protein and rbd epitopes of mers-cov when co-administered with mf59 significantly augmented their immunogenicity resulting in strong induction of igg and neutralizing antibody response the preparations protected the mice from lethal virus challenge 61 62 63 many mers-cov rbd candidate vaccines adjuvanted with mf59 were developed and tested in mice these vaccines elicited neutralizing antibodies and protected the hdpp4 transduced mice from the lethal challenge table 3 63 64 montanide is a water-in-oil wo emulsion that contains mineral oil and surfactant from mannide

of montanide isa-51 and cpg odn oligodeoxynucleotide has been used widely in many vaccines as the combination exerts a synergistic effect in boosting the th1 immune response montanide isa-51 and cpg were used to emulsify the recombinant n protein of sars-cov the formulation elicited strong th1 immune responses in mice and macaques 71 the synthetic peptides of the spike protein of sars-cov formulated with an adjuvant montanide isa-51cpg combination elicited strong antibody titer in immunized animals that were capable of inhibiting sars-cov pseudovirus entry into hepg2 cells 72 a dna vaccine encoding sars-cov n protein elicited a potent n protein-specific immune response when co-administered with montanide isa-51cpg adjuvants 73 the recombinant rbd of mers-cov when adjuvanted with montanide isa-51 induced high titers of serum antibodies that could neutralize the virus in cell culture 74 the above pieces of evidence from the previous studies indicate that montanide isa-51 may increase the immunogenicity of the vaccines based on recombinant spike protein or synthetic peptides corresponding to rbd of s protein further it may be used along with cpg odn to induce an overall th1 biased immune response as a predominantly th2 immune response seems to cause ade on the viral challenge following immunization these are oil-in-water adjuvant systems developed by glaxosmithkline gsk the as01 adjuvant system 01 is a liposome-based adjuvant that is consist of monophosphoryl lipid a mpl and a saponin molecule qs-21 whereas as03 adjuvant system 03 is an -tocopherol and squalene-based adjuvant that has been used in gsks ah1n1 pandemic flu vaccine pandemrix the mpl is extracted from salmonella minnesota and qs-21 is purified from the bark of the south american tree quillaja saponaria molina the mpl signals through toll-like receptor-4 tlr4 which results in the activation of apcs and the production of cytokines and interferons ifns q-21 is reported to induce antigen-specific antibody response as well as cell-mediated immunity 75 76 when co-administered with recombinant sars-cov s protein q-21 induced high titers of antigen-specific serum antibodies and protected from viral infection 77 the as01 system has been used in recently developed rtssas01 malaria vaccine as well as tested in herpes zoster subunit vaccine polyprotein hiv-1 vaccine and tuberculosis mtb72fas02 candidate vaccine 78 79 80 81 further these adjuvants have also been used with inactivated sars-cov vaccine preparation in mice and hamsters the as01b-adjuvanted vaccine was slightly more immunogenic than the as03a-adjuvanted vaccine the vaccine in animals immunized with adjuvant provided better protection than the non-adjuvanted vaccine importantly the study did not observe enhance disease ade in the lungs or liver of hamsters following sars-cov challenge 82 delta inulin di is one of the many isoforms of inulin polysaccharide which is stable at a higher temperature and has better immune potency it activates the complement system and when co-administered with antigen helps mount a robust antigen-specific adaptive immune response consisting of both antibody and cell-mediated immunity a th0 adjuvant property 83 84 85 a balanced enhancement of both th1 and th2 responses was observed when di advax adjuvant was co-administered with an inactivated jev japanese encephalitis virus and influenza vaccines which conferred the protection against the viral challenges 83 86 similarly when recombinant spike protein or inactivated sars-cov vaccine was co-administered with delta inulin plus cpg oligonucleotide as adjuvants the combination significantly enhanced serum neutralizing antibody titers without causing lung immunopathology which was not the case when alum was used instead of delta inulin 45 tlrs are pattern recognition receptors prrs that identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps these are present on cell surfaces as well as in endosomal compartments interaction with the appropriate ligand triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines and type -1 ifns interferons which activates the cells of the innate and adaptive immune system leading to antigen-specific enhanced humoral and cell-mediated responses 87 therefore tlr ligands have been widely studied and tested as immune adjuvants in many human and veterinary vaccine preparations against infectious diseases 88 89 90 different tlr ligands induce a different type of immune response th1th2th0 depending on the signaling pathway involved the tlrs that have been widely used in vaccine adjuvant studies and their ligands are as follow tlr3 dsrna 4 lps 5 flagellin 7 ssrna 8ssrna and 9 unmethylated cpg oligonucleotide 88 out of these only tlr4 ligand which is mpl has been approved for use in human vaccine formulations such as human papillomavirus vaccine cervarix hepatitis fendrix gsk biologicals and malaria rts sas01 or mosquirix nevertheless many other tlr adjuvants have shown promising results and may make their way to human vaccine formulation in time to come tlr ligands have been tested with the inactivated sars-cov vaccines since an inactivated vaccine with alum adjuvant has been reported to cause eosinophil infiltration in the lungs of immunized animals following live viral challenge the tlr ligands lipopolysaccharide polyu and polyic and the vaccine combination protected the animals with significantly reduced eosinophil infiltration in the lungs 91 intranasal administration of a tlr3 agonist polyic induced ifn- and ifn- production and protected the animals from sars-cov infection therefore the polyic as a prophylactic measure should be further evaluated for use in aged or high-risk individuals 92 there are many ways an intranasal application of vaccines may benefit the mucosal immune response generated following intranasal vaccine application may block the viral entry and alleviate the concern associated with systemic administration of inactivated vaccine ie immunopathology in the lungs mice immunized with inactivated sars-cov and cpg resulted in the local production of specific iga and neutralizing antibodies in serum this strategy may offer double protection once at the site of entry and the second when the virus enters the circulation 88 similar results were observed by another lab that reported induction of significant levels of sars-cov specific igg antibodies in sera and a detectable amount of iga antibodies in sera and mucosal secretions when an inactivated vaccine adjuvanted with cpg odn 2006 was administered intranasally 94 a tlr3 ligand pika polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid based adjuvant which a stabilized derivative of polyic also produced similar results when administered with inactivated sars-cov vaccine both the intranasal and intraperitoneal administration of pika with inactivated sars-cov induced significant levels of both mucosal and serum antibodies 95 moreover polyic was superior to alum with a chimeric vlps expressing mers-cov rbd protein vaccine when administered to mice polyic elicited stronger neutralizing antibody as well as cell-mediated responses that prevented pseudotyped virus entry into susceptible cells 96 the cpg odn polyic and r848tlr78 ligands when used with hla-a0201 restricted sars-cov s epitopes all three agonists enhanced the epitope-specific cd8 t cells though the effect was more pronounced with cpg odn the immune response induced was stated to carry a memory cell phenotype that had long-term survival ability 97 further there are concerns the spike protein subunit vaccine adjuvanted only with alum favors th2 response might trigger immunopathology in the lungs therefore inclusion of a tlr ligand that favors th1 response may provide dual benefits reduction in ade as well as the activation of both the arms of the immune system further a combination of either a recombinant s protein of sars-cov or an n-terminal domain rntd of mers-cov with alum and cpg induced high igg2a antibody titers and ifn- production 98 99 many helminth-derived molecules have been shown to have potent immunostimulatory effects including asp-1 the asp-1 is present in helminth onchocerca volvulus a recombinant asp-1 rov-asp-1 is reported to induce a mix of th1 and th2 responses when included with vaccine antigen however depending on the antigen it could also activate a predominantly th1 type of immune response 100 101 therefore it can be beneficial in a condition where bits of help from both the arms of the immune response is needed to clear the infection further the immune response induced against the asp-1 protein adjuvant did not affect its adjuvant activity on subsequent boost 102 asp-1 has been shown to improve igg1 and igg2a antibody levels against commercially available vaccines such as influenza and rabies and the adjuvant effect observed was higher than either traditional adjuvant alum or mpl plus trehalose dicorynomycolate tdm 100 103 104 a recombinant asp-1 protein when included with recombinant sars-cov spike protein antigen or an rbd containing vaccine the combinations induced a mixed immune response with th1 dominance 100 similar findings were observed when rov-asp-1 was used as an adjuvant with either s protein of sars-cov or hiv-1gp120 105 further immunization with rbd of sars-cov plus rov-asp-1 in nhps resulted in a high titer of neutralizing anti-rbd antibodies with only low levels of anti- rov-asp-1 antibodies 102 a complex of proteosomes with lps derived from shigella flexneri is named as protollin whereas proteosomes itself contain hydrophobic outer membrane proteins derived from neisseria meningitides protollin exerts its immunostimulatory effect via tlr2 and tlr4 signaling resulting in the production of cytokines ifns and the activation of apcs intranasal administration of protollin with influenza antigen split or recombinant ha induced both serum igg and mucosal secretory iga that protected the mice from lethal virus challenge 106 107 further its application was shown to be effective in reducing allergic asthma in a mouse model 108 protective against the development of pneumonia in a murine model of shigella infection 109 and safe and well-tolerated in healthy adults 110 protollin was an effective safe and immunogenic and induced protective antibody response consisting of both serum igg and mucosal iga in humans when administered intranasally with trivalent influenza vaccine 111 protollin when administered intranasally with recombinant sars-cov s protein induced significant levels of antigen-specific serum igg and mucosal iga antibodies as compared alum plus recombinant s protein administered via intramuscular route and protected the mice from the live viral challenge 112 therefore as evidence reflects protollin adjuvant appears to be safe and well-tolerated in human more importantly its ability to induce both serum and mucosal immunity might prove to be beneficial and should be explored further in sars-cov-2 vaccine development many investigations have revealed an over activation of the immune system when an animal is challenged with the live virus following immunization it causes immunopathological changes because of the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines cytokine storm such as il-2 il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 il-17 il-1 g-csf gm-csf and tnf 153 154 155 ade or immune enhancement occurs when a virus gains access into the immune cells while adhered to the antibodies leading to an increase in infectivity and virulence of the virus once inside the cells which arent the usual target the virus multiplies and releases its progenies infecting more cells 156 many viruses such as dengue yellow fever hiv and covs have been reported to induce ade 157 most pieces of evidence suggest viruses exploit the fc receptor fcr on the immune cells to gain entry while being attached to the antibody-binding site of the antibodies the fc region of the antibody has a sequence that binds to complement system or immune cells expressing fcr receptors 158 159 the presence of high levels of non-neutralizing antibodies appears to be the primary reason that triggers ade 43 other factors that contribute include low-affinity or sub-optimal levels of neutralizing antibodies and isotype of antibodies induced 42 43 the presence of circulating antibodies against related epitopes from different strains or related viruses may also contribute to the enhancement of disease 160 though data is conflicting it has been observed in many inactivated virus vaccine experiments on sars and mers-covs 36 39 40 41 however incorporation of a predominantly th1 inducing adjuvant seemed to address the issue 45 there is no evidence yet that antibody-dependent disease enhancement could be associated with the sars-cov-2 vaccine rather recent experiments with sars-cov-2 vaccines have shown promising results without ade in rodents and macaques 113 115 161 recent data available on vaccine studies with sars-cov-2 in nhps appears promising an inactivated vaccine picovacc adjuvanted with alum elicited spike and rbd protein-specific neutralizing antibodies and protected the macaques on the viral challenge importantly the study did not observe ade in immunized animals table 4
 113 the recombinant s1 protein of the virus fused with fc and adjuvanted with saponin microemulsion when administered to macaques induced a strong anti-s1 neutralizing antibodies 114 the oxford universitys vaccine candidate chadox1 ncov-19 encoding the s protein of sars-cov-2 protected rhesus monkeys from developing pneumonia the vaccine significantly reduced the viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue without causing disease enhancement in vaccinated monkeys 161 further a recently concluded phase i clinical trial with ad5-ncov adenovirus type 5 vector expressing s protein vaccine reported promising findings the vaccine has been found to be safe well-tolerated and induced both humoral and cellular immunity 164 encouraging results have also been received from a recently concluded phase i clinical trial for the mers-cov vaccine table 5
 an mva-mers-s mva modified vaccinia virus ankara dna vaccine was safe well-tolerated and produced both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in 87 of the participants after the second dose 144 the mva vector technology may be repurposed to develop a covid-19 vaccine by incorporating sars-cov-2 s protein further to expedite the development of the sars-cov-2 vaccine many leading vaccine manufacturers are coming together and collaborating this has enabled them to share each others proprietary molecular compounds which already have some degree of safety approval to date 10 vaccine candidates have entered either phase i or ii of clinical trials table 6
 and many are in preclinical or developing stages table 7
 out of these ad5-ncov cansino biologics inc is advancing quickly and has reached the second phase of clinical trials many of these are using the established adjuvant system with their covid-19 vaccine candidates an adjuvant based on tlr9 agonists cpg 1018 which has been developed by dynavax technologies corp usa is being used in a recombinant spike protein s-trimer vaccine candidate against covid-19 announced by clover biopharmaceutics china 116 the cpg 1018 adjuvant has been used in an fda food and drug administration -approved hepatitis b vaccine heplisav-b glaxosmithkline has also teamed up with many firms such as xiamen innovax biotech and sanofi to make its adjuvant technology available to the collaborators for their vaccine candidates 117 both sanofi and xiamen innovax biotech are using gsks as03 adjuvant squalene-based in their recombinant protein vaccine candidates similarly csl commonwealth serum laboratories australia and seqirus germany have tied up to use the mf59 adjuvant which uses novel molecular-clam technology in their covid-19 vaccine candidate 118 novavax usa on the other hand is using its proprietary matrix-m adjuvant for their vaccine candidate nvx-cov2373 consisting of nanoparticles carrying sars-cov-2 spike protein antigens 119 another biopharma company soligenix inc has collaborated with btg speciality pharmaceutics soligenix will use a novel vaccine adjuvant covaccine ht from btg with its covid-19 vaccine candidate 120 covaccine ht is an oil-in-water emulsion consisting of sucrose fatty acid sulfate easter sfase and squalene which has been reported to induce both humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity 121 122 ibio has signed up an agreement with infectious disease research institute idri seattle us in an effort to utilize their novel adjuvants such as gla glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant a synthetic analogue of the mpl for its sars-cov-2 vlp vaccine development 123 124 the experience and knowledge generated from the past vaccine studies with different adjuvants against similar covs may expedite the development of an adjuvanted vaccine against covid-19 the inclusion of an adjuvant may cut down the amount of antigen significantly in a vaccine especially when vaccine candidates are recombinant spikerbd protein this could help address an overwhelming demand for the vaccine in a pandemic in a short time so far there is no firm evidence whether an antibody response is sufficient or a t-cell response is also critical for recovery from sars-cov-2 infection past studies on similar covs have observed that t-cell immunity also plays a crucial role in clearing the viral infection therefore the inclusion of an adjuvant with a recombinant spikerbd protein vaccine candidate which stimulates a mixed immune response such as delta inulin covaccine ht matrix-m mf59 as03 and rov-asp-1 might be appropriate in such a scenario however selecting an adjuvant that has a proven safety profile and efficacy may be advantageous for obtaining quick clearance from the regulatory bodies though delta inulin covaccine ht matrix-m and rov-asp-1 have shown good safety and efficacy in pre-clinical and clinical trials cpg 1018 mf59 and as03 are already approved for human vaccines and their inclusion may expedite the vaccine development process further protollin has shown promising results in pre-clinical studies in inducing both systemic and mucosal immune responses against viruses affecting the respiratory system and should be further evaluated with sars-cov-2 a few past studies with inactivated sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines alone or with adjuvant have been reported to cause antibody-mediated enhancement of disease on the live viral challenge following immunization however so far we have no conclusive evidence that the same phenomenon will happen with sars-cov-2 in fact a recent study on rhesus macaque with alum adjuvanted inactivated vaccine revealed the development of protective immune responses without causing disease enhancement 113 nevertheless other studies have suggested the use of a th1 favoring adjuvant such as cpg 1018 might help ease such concerns none  vaccination strategies to combat novel corona virus sars-cov-2 satish pandey chandra veni pande diksha sati shobha upreti mukesh samant   in december 2019 a large number of patients with the symptoms similar to pneumonia with unknown cause were detected from the city of wuhan in hubei province in china 12 reports say that most of the original cases had close contact with a local animal and seafood market of wuhan china 34 further the detailed sequence analysis of the sample taken from lower respiratory tract of a patient revealed the existence of a novel coronavirus later named as sars-cov-2 that was never been reported earlier in humans 5 infections with sars-cov-2 are now widespread around the globe and are increasing exponentially every day a total of 6 million cases with sars-cov-2 infections have been confirmed up to may 29th 2020 and 360000 people have died across the world coronaviruses covs are the largest group of viruses belonging to family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales 67 they are either pleomorphic or spherical in shape with a diameter of 125 nm 89 further they are characterized by club shaped spike projections on its surface transmission of covid-19 is mainly caused by respiratory droplets direct human to human contact and fecal to oral transmission might be also associated 10 covid-19 prominently affect the respiratory tract both lower and upper respiratory tract with the initial symptoms of common cold fever dry cough fatigue nasal congestion sore throat and diarrhea to severe pneumonia difficulty in breathing and ends with the patient death 11 the incubation period of the disease is 14 days and the time from onset of symptom to developing pneumonia is 4 days 10 the reservoir hosts of the disease are bats and himalayan palm civets 12 but the scientists in guangzhou have reported coronavirus from pangolin the ant eating mammal with 99 homology with a receptor binding domain matching to that of sars-cov-2 however this is not confirmed yet 13 these are the enveloped viruses that contain segmented positive sense ss-rna genome of approximately 30 kb which is the largest among all the rna viruses 14 the genetic material of cov is highly prone to frequent recombination process that results into the formation of new strains with altered virulence 15 there are four relatively benign strains of human coronaviruses hcovs 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 causing mild respiratory flu like seasonal illnesses however three strains sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are reported to be extremely pathogenic it is thought that sars-cov-2 might be the next series of the previous two outbreaks sars-cov mers-cov as the covs are the emerging viruses which are highly adapted to the changing environment further with its genome closely related to sars-cov and mers-cov and the accumulated clinical and experimental data on these previous viruses we can precisely predict the possible vaccine candidates to prevent against cov infection in the future 16 currently there is no specific antiviral drug against sars-cov-2 finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority 17 in this review we aim to discuss about different approaches for developing an effective vaccine against covid-19 the most effective licensed vaccines elicit long-term antigen-specific antibody responses by plasma cells in addition to the development of persisting t cell and b cell memory in case of sars-cov infection both humoral and cellular immune responses are crucial for the clearance of infection fig 1
 recombinant virus vectors work in a similar manner like an endogenous pathogen by expressing axenic target protein in cytoplasm of the host cell after processing of such endogenous antigen mhc class 1 molecules present them to cd8 t-lymphocytes which causes production of t-cytotoxic cells this pathway leads to establishment of cell-mediated immunity which is crucial in getting rid of virus infected cells sub unit vaccine candidate particularly rbd of s protein of sars-cov contains major antigenic determinants that can induce neutralizing antibodies 18 the sars-cov s protein can also induce cd8 t-cell responses the rbd of s protein contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes and is the main domain that induces neutralizing antibody and t-cell immune responses against sars-cov infection 1920 making it an important target for vaccine development the approaches for developing rbd-based vaccines against sars-cov have provided useful information for designing safe and effective vaccines against sars-cov 2 since rbds of sars-cov 2 also contain similar epitopes similarly adenoviral vectors are able to induce potent antibody as well as t cell responses with variations in the immune response depending on the serotype employed 21 replication-deficient ad5 one of the most widely used adenoviral vectors is able to induce exceptionally potent cd8 t cell as well as antibody responses 22 furthermore dna vaccination is also able to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses through activation of cd8 cytotoxic and cd4 helper t cells respectively upon entry in the cell dna vaccines are sensed by a variety of innate immune receptors ie stingtbk1irf3 pathways and the aim2 inflammasome and many other factors are involved in dna vaccine mode of action 23 but the exact mechanism of action is yet to be evaluated however immunization with s protein encoding dna vaccine elicited protective immunity against sars-cov infection in a mouse model by inducing t cell and neutralizing antibody responses 24 another nucleotide based vaccine ie exogenous mrna is also immunostimulatory as it is recognized by a variety of cell surface endosomal and cytosolic innate immune receptors mammalian cells can sense foreign rna via pattern recognition receptors prrs such as tlr3 tlr7 and tlr8 located in the endosomes and rig-i mda-5 and pkr located in the cytoplasm as well as nlrp3 and nod2 25 activation of the prrs by mrna vaccines results in a robust innate immune response including production of chemokines and cytokines such as il-12 and tnf at the inoculation site 26 which are innate factors crucial for the induction of an effective adaptive immune response against the encoded antigen id immunization with mrna vaccines upregulates the expression of chemokines including the cxcr3-ligands cxcl9 cxcl10 and cxcl11 that recruit innate immune cells such as dcs and macrophages to the site of injection 26 the mrna vaccines can also induce an immunological repertoire associated with the generation of high magnitude long-lived antibodies 27 dna vaccination confers an attractive approach for developing a sars vaccine due to their simplicity stability safety and easy production ability as compared to other conventional approach in the field of dna vaccination substantial progress have been recorded in the past decades with the production of hiv-1 vaccines the first dna vaccine demonstrated in human which depicts the safety and protective efficacy of the vaccine 33 besides this various other dna vaccines including aids 34 malaria and influenza 35 are also under human trial dna vaccine made up of plasmid dna encoding protein from pathogens have been demonstrated for inducing both t and b cell responses after showing the similar effects of live viruses that antigenic proteins are produced endogenously and presented efficiently by mhc class i thus help in inducing cd8 t-cell responses 36 further as the dna vaccines are simple stable safe and can be easily produced it can be possible option to the use of live vaccines 36 there are numbers of sars-cov proteins viz s 242837 38 39 40 m 41 and n 4243 proteins reported to induce cellular and humoral responses have been utilized as dna vaccine candidates 40 in a study dna vaccine associated expression of s protein have generated both t-cell and neutralizing antibody responses and lowered the replication of sars-cov in the respiratory tract this manifested that protective efficacy to the s gene in mice was antibody mediated not t-cell dependent 24 further in a study s plasmid improved the gene expression of spike s protein by heterologous viral rna export elements and protection in mouse model 39 but their role have not been recorded in case of other in vivo models vaccination of mice with multi-epitope dna vaccine has elicited specific antibody response to two candidate epitopes s437459 and m120 which reduced the virulence of sars-cov in-vitro but there was no report on the protective efficacy 41 in another study mice immunized with n-dna vaccine induced n-specific antibody response and tc-cell activity 4244 moreover a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity dth and cd8 ctl responses to n protein was observed 44 in an another study of n-dna vaccination expression of n protein and its linkage to lamp for better presentation of mhc ii has amplified memory response 45 moreover vaccination of c57bl6 mice with naked crtn dna for improved mhc class i presentation not only induced n-specific humoral and cellular immunity but also considerably reduced the titer of challenging vaccinia virus against the cells expressing n protein 43 in addition to other animal models an n-dna vaccine candidate has also been evaluated in hla-transgenic mice that induced a specific cd8 t-cell response 46 besides the expression of s and n proteins m protein have also been reported to be expressed in mice and found to induce neutralizing antibodies human monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte response 47 in a comprehensive study of dna vaccine using different gene fragments s- m- and n m dna vaccine was reported with the highest cellular immunity in mice 40 although dna vaccines works efficiently during preclinical stages but their efficacy in field conditions are quite unsatisfactory and have lower immunogenicity 48 as compared to other vaccines such as inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines and need further improvement regarding the efficacy to confront this problem different primeboost approaches such as heterologous prime or boost with proteins inactivated viral vaccine candidates or viral vectors have been constructed 284149 50 51 there are various practices mostly the traditional one that has been approached to make a vaccine but these methods on an average takes 16 years as in the case from human papilloma virus to rotavirus the development of a protein-based vaccine requires growth of the viruses and its protein purification which is a lengthy process and may take several years to make an effective and new generation vaccine against this fast spreading virus instead of protein mrna vaccination strategy can be a better approach 52 the mrna vaccine manifests the immune responses similar to natural infection and provides a short synthetic viral mrna which is then used by the host to produce the antigen proteins since the mrna used in vaccine after injected cant integrate into the hosts genome they are safe to use furthermore they are safer than inactivated or protein based vaccines because they are free from the risk of protein contamination or the injected virus to become active the huge benefit of mrna vaccine is that it can circumvent the hassle associated with the purification of viral proteins that saves the time from months to years used in standardization and scaling up the mass production 52 so far there is no approved rna vaccine but are under clinical trials the national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid usa in collaboration with moderna have initiated a research to develop an mrna vaccine called mrna-1273 53 which produces a stable form of the sars-cov-2 spike protein s niaid has registered a phase 1 clinical trial of the vaccine candidates on 45 healthy adults completed on 19th march 2020 in seattle 5455 while the other clinical trials of phase 1 mrna vaccines mrna-1273 and another mrna-based vaccine candidate bnt162 currently in pre-clinical testing are expected to start in april 2020 5356 however the proposal of mrna based vaccine development is not new since extracellular ribonucleases is everywhere in the cytoplasm so the unprotected naked mrna alone is not very stable to be used as a prophylactic vaccine due to the presence of strong net negative charge and hydrophilic nature the rna cannot be taken up easily by the cells during in vivo condition thus it requires highly efficient carriers such as new generations of liquid nano particles lnp to stabilize and pack the mrna into an injectable form which is also done in the case of the mrna-1273 vaccine being developed today thus dna and mrna vaccines that are easier to design and proceed into clinical trials very quickly are excellent target for development of vaccines against sars-cov 2 and other related outbreaks in future spike protein s of virus performs significant part in entering the host 57 the cov-rna genome is allowed to go inside the cells of host through the early interactions of s1 domain to its receptor in the host ie pp 4 in mers-cov and ace2 in sars-cov followed by the viral and host membrane fusion facilitated by the s2 segment to develop vaccines based on cov subunit s proteins are the preferred candidate because s proteins have sites for binding of receptor as well as for membrane fusion vaccines based on s protein are likely to activate antibodies that prevent the binding of virus and later fusion of membranes as well thereby counteracting infection of virus 58 s glycoprotein of sars-cov which is shown to bind the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is an interesting candidate to target for both vaccine and therapeutic improvement 3259 this practice is robustly encouraged by the discovery that illustrates the infectivity by sars-cov is powerfully counteracted by human mab that binds to s protein through n-terminal and thereby prevents binding of receptor by hindering the formation of syncytia 60 on the other hand few epitopes that are not neutralizing are also present in the immmuno-predominant sites of the s protein of sars-cov 61 that could elicit the immune responses which might be harmful 62 for that reason the identification and elimination of such epitopes in s protein is obligatory moreover the s protein have been reported to produce serum neutralizing antibodies and protected african green monkeys and mice challenged with sars-cov 2463 s-ectodomain proteins of full length merged withwithout s or s-foldon ie fold on trimeric motif may induce precise antibody response and neutralizing antibody thus causing protection of the vaccinated mice to sars-cov infection 64 besides this s protein associated with sars-cov is also shown to be responsible for eliciting responses by t-cell cd4 and cd8 49 rbd is a segment in the centre of s1 subunit of s protein which is 193 aa residues and binds to receptors present in the target cells it has been illustrated that antisera of sars infected person and that of animals inoculated with inactivated sars-cov effectively responded with rbd 6566 a lot of the neutralizing antibodies were removed of these antisera by rbd through antibodies absorption while the antibodies specific to rbd having effective neutralizing action were obtained from these antisera 66 it has also been represented that the rbd vaccinated mice and rabbits produces counteracting antibodies in high number against the sars-cov having 50 neutralizing titers at a 110000 serum dilution 67 as compared to s protein of full length high number of neutralizing antibodies were induced with rbd 246768 because in contrast to s protein with full length no immunodominant regions are present in rbd that elicits antibodies that are not neutralizing to prevent the infection from sars-cov with different genotypes rbd containing recombinant proteins or vectors that encodes rbd could be used thus the generation of antibodies targeting the rbd subunit of sars-cov-2 would be an important preventive and treatment strategy that can be tested further in suitable models before clinical trials besides the above mentioned proteins expression of various other proteins have also been reported on the virion surface with the production of antibodies in sars patients serum 69 further these proteins can also be evaluated to check the protective efficacy against sars-cov for instance counteracting action of the antibodies toward m proteins has also been reported 70 membrane or m protein plays an essential role in upholding the configuration of viral envelope 71 and m protein carries out this by making interactions with different cov proteins 72 incorporating golgi complex into novel virions 71 and stabilizing proteins of the nucleocapsid 71 investigations on animal cov vaccines have reported that the nucleocapsid protein n of cov could serve as additional target for the development of vaccine 73 even though the antibodies to n proteins of cov does not have mechanism to neutralize the virus but generation of cov-restricted cd8 t cells has been reported 74 75 76 consequently providing protection subsequent to infection in animals 77 therefore this suggest that in vivo defense could be offered by the protein by eliciting cell-mediated response 7478 research have shown that precise igg antibodies as well as subtypes igg1 and igg2a were induced when freunds adjuvant was conjugated with sars-cov n protein that was plant expressed while conjugating adjutants like cysteine-phosphate-guanine cpg and montanide isa-51 with n protein that was e coli-expressed results in induction of definite igg antibodies toward a th1 igg2a-type response in mice 7980 however the conserved n protein across cov families implies that it is not a suitable candidate for vaccine development and the antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov-2 do not provide immunity to the infection 81 adenovirus based delivery systems have several benefits including their ease of administration by oral or nasal route their non-pathogenicity in humans 84 particularly for mutants with compromised replication 85 defending power of ad-vectored vaccines against sars-cov was first demonstrated in rhesus macaques in 2003 86 they were immunized with three ad5sars-cov ad-based vector constructs expressing genes for n s and m proteins the vaccine induced antibody reaction against spike s1 fragment production of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies and t-cell proliferation against the n protein 86 in a similar study when ad vector expressing sars n- protein was used to vaccinate c57bl6 strain mice surprisingly no neutralizing antibodies were produced but sars-cov-specific ifn- secretion and t-cell production was detected 84 when 129s6svev strain mice was co- immunized with 2 ad vector constructs containing genes coding for sars-cov s and n proteins by either nasal or muscular route it suggested that former induced ig a and effectively checks sars-cov reproduction in nasal and alveolar tissues while the later works by proliferating neutralizing antibodies 87 a number of studies analyzing efficacy of these vaccines have been done in ferrets being it the only model that resembles most of the symptoms of human patients including fever transmission by respiratory route discharge of virus from upper airways and lung injuries 8889 when ferrets were primed with adenoviral construct coding s-protein and boosted with a different adenovirus from chimpanzee a significant reduction in viral load and other clinical symptoms was observed 90 targeting that serotype to which humans are nave is the focal point of recent adenoviral constructs for this chimpanzee adenovirus chadox1 is a promising candidate owing to its lack of persistent immunity in humans 91 and superior safety status presently a potential mers-cov vaccine named mers001 is at clinical trial having chadox1coding for s-protein of mers-cov 92 but restricted cloning ability limited host range 93 and pre-existent immunity against adenovirus in significant proportion of human population 8394 are some of their limitations which makes their animal testing challenging and retards their clinical use as a vector for vaccine designing the poxvirus constructs are potent vectors due to better stability greater insert size easy production cytoplasmic gene expression and capacity to elicit long-termed cell mediated and humoral immunity 83 in a study replication-compromised poxvirus vector modified vaccinia ankara mva strain coding for sars-cov s protein generate neutralizing antibody response and reduced viral load in the upper airways of mice 63 mva constructs expressing entire s protein are potent vaccine target 95 96 97 an additional vaccine target is mva-mers-s presently in phase i clinical trial at university medical center hamburg-eppendorf germany 98 studies involving relatively conserved n protein expressing mva in mice generated cd8 cells 99 newcastle disease virus ndv viral-vector contain mers-cov s protein which generated neutralizing antibody response in balbc mice and bactrian camels 100 although ndv vaccines elicited vigorous immune response but also have many limitations namely persistent immunity against ndv higher threat of pathogenesis low viral titer production and possible carcinogenesis 101 since viral vector-based vaccines could be quickly constructed and used without an adjuvant development of such vaccines might be possible in sars-cov-2 because rbd of s-protein has been identified as a neutralizing epitope 102 so this epitope could be actively pursued for the development of viral vector based vaccines historical evidences demonstrate that live attenuated vaccines are the most successful vaccines against intracellular pathogens as they have already proven in case of various bacterial and viral pathogens 103 104 105 it is an attractive approach where attenuated live virus confers immune responses similar to natural infection without posing any risk of infection and provides long lasting protective immunity development of a vaccine should follow some stringent criteria where safety efficacy and reproducibility are of paramount significance these vaccines are more efficient as they persists for longer period of time showcases the entire viral antigens complement to the host immune system deliver antigen to the appropriate compartments of cells and tissues to produce endogenous proteins efficient in mhc class i presentation and finally help in generating a strong cytotoxic t-cell response further it improves the potential of live attenuated vaccines to support antigen-specific effectors and memory immune responses so that a long term protective immunity can be achieved however attenuated vaccination is a promising approach in the field of viral infection but the main difficulty is the reversion of the pathogen to its virulent form as happened in the case of oral vaccine of poliovirus 106 from the safety point of view it is often very difficult to get vaccine regulatory approval and using such vaccines without strong evidence is a huge risk although this limit for sars has not yet been met but some attractive attenuated mutants have been developed deletion of e protein encoding gene abrogated the virulence of covs and several studies have explored the potential of recombinant sars-cov or mers-cov with a mutated e protein 107108 further vaccination of hamsters with this mutant have shown raised level of serum-neutralizing antibodies and protected from clinical sign and replication of homologous sars-cov urbani and heterologous gd03 sars-cov in the respiratory tract both the upper and lower respiratory tract 109 thus deletion of the structural e gene may prove to be the first step in the field of developing a live-attenuated vaccine against sars-cov moreover nsp-1 gene deleted cov mouse hepatitis virus mhv has also been reported with high efficacy thus can also be used for developing a sars-attenuated vaccine 110 two studies related to gene deletion and attenuation effects suggests that removal of orfs 3a 3b 6 7a 7b 8a 8b or 9b results in very little and no viral replication during in-vitro and in vivo conditions 108111 however the outcomes of the studies conducted so far are not so convincing because it takes longer time to create non-infectious clones of coronavirus due to larger genome size and also requires extensive safety testing 112 furthermore reversion of the pathogen to the virulent form can be protected using gene replacement knockout strategy that can be safer as compared to the lines developed by other means like chemical treatment and irradiation etc inactivated virus vaccines also known as the wkv whole killed virus vaccines represent a pathogen whose ability to infect and replicate has been ceased consequently making it sterile but retaining its ability to act as an immunogen so that the immune system could still work if such a pathogen is injected into a host inactivated vaccines are prepared by neutralizing the pathogen as a whole by chemicals or by heat and radiation it is thought that inactivated vaccines can be prepared with much less effort which makes them one of the attractive types of vaccines prepared in the market today these vaccines work by exposing the same epitopes which a virus otherwise would have presented thus eliciting an immune response when sera of the infected person were tested presence of antibodies against minimum eight different proteins suggests the presence of diverse moieties exposed on the membrane of the pathogen 69 in order to search targets for the protective antibodies further investigations has been done and it is found that additional structural proteins that can be targeted are encoded by open reading frame orfs 3a 6 7a and 7b envelope e spike s and matrix m 49113 114 115 116 by interpreting these data we can assume that multiple targets are present for the protective antibodies 3cl nucleocapsid n s m etc are the proteins against which the antibodies were induced when a mice was vaccinated with sars-cov 117 despite many advantages there are some limitations for the development of inactivated vaccines viz budding pathogens in bulk biosafety level 3 and complete sterilization of the grown pathogens successful sterilization of sars-cov in bulk has been demonstrated with the help of uv radiations 118 during the last two decades many investigators have demonstrated that inactivated whole sars-cov can induce sars-cov neutralizing antibody 65117119 120 121 122 but there have no study been reported against the live sars-cov challenge a study in balbc mice wkv vaccine was observed to provide resistance by ceasing the multiplication of pulmonary sars-cov however immunological responses are yet to be verified 123 further -propiolactone inactivated wkv sars-cov tor-2 strain reported to be a potential vaccine candidate as it induced neutralizing antibodies and was able to minimize the virus load in the pulmonary tract of the mouse model 87 however there are less evidences of the mouse models being infected by such a diseases clinically thus studying models where this strain is more virulent and sustainable is imperative so wkv has also been tested in ferrets a model which show significant lung pathology and clinical sign 8990 formalin inactivated urbani strain of sars-cov did not demonstrated strong immune response 124 but -propiolactone inactivated wkv sars-cov induced significant neutralizing antibody and reduced virus replication in respiratory tract of ferrets 89 rhesus monkeys were also been tested for the formaldehyde inactivated sars-cov vaccines and shown to be safe and immunogenic 125 wkv sars-cov has also been tested in humans and found to be safe and elicited sars-cov specific neutralizing antibodies however the efficiency the vaccine in humans yet to be reported 126 these data suggested that wkv vaccines are safe and they are able to induce sars-cov specific neutralizing antibodies so inactivated viral vaccines could also be evaluated as potential vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 many countries are affected by the rapid outbreak of sar-cov-2 infections so there is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective sarcov-2 vaccine various research groups around the world have been able to start sar-cov-2 vaccine development by gaining knowledge from sars and mers vaccines development strategies in this review we have extensively discussed the various vaccine targets or strategies based on sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine studies the receptor-binding domain rdb of spike protein s might be considered as a good vaccine antigen because it induces neutralizing antibodies that prevent host cell attachment and infection 127 128 129 further nucleic acid based vaccine showed the most advance platform in response to emerging pathogens dna vaccine was the first vaccine candidate that entered in clinical trial nct02809443 130 1-year after the zika virus outbreak another nucleic acid-based vaccine m-rna vaccine can be considered as advanced vaccine technology because of its stability and protein translation efficiency so that it could induce robust immune responses 52131 currently there are various biopharmaceutical companies or academic sectors are in the race to develop the prophylactic sar-cov-2 vaccine by using several platforms including mrna dna vaccinia or adenoviral vector and recombinant protein 112132 in order to make effective sar-cov-2 vaccine possible target antigensnucleotide identification immunization route immune protection suitable animal models scalability production facility target product profile tpp outbreak forecasting and target population etc are important parameters as it is already known for some of the recent epidemics zika and ebola whose successful vaccine has not been developed yet lesson-learned from these epidemics in order to speed up the available vaccine during ongoing outbreak preclinical studies of sar-cov-2 vaccine candidates may need to be performed in parallel with clinical trials but in reality sars-cov-2 vaccines will not be available for another 1218 months because of the limitations such as unavailability of appropriate animal models to check the efficacy and toxicity before going for the clinical trials further it should comply with good manufacturing practice cgmp to ensure the safety in humans post animal studies and cgmp clinical trial might be initiated in three phases phase i ii and iii finally it require more time for the distribution and administration of the vaccine in a population currently nave to sars-cov-2 infection so there is a need of tight coordination and technology transfer among governments regulatory agencies pharmaceutical companies and the world health organization who for the global production of effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 112 as the covid-19 causes serious global health concerns investigation into the characteristics of sars-cov-2 its interaction with the host immune responses could provide a clearer picture of how the pathogen causes diseases in some individuals and mild or no infection in others further the evaluation of immunity and long-term memory of covid-19 recovered individuals may be helpful in designing of a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent not only against sars-cov-2 but other similar coronaviruses during future outbreaks the authors have declared no conflict of interest  mers-cov vaccine candidates in development the current landscape kayvon modjarrad   middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov was first isolated in september 2012 from a patient in saudi arabia who presented two months earlier with severe acute respiratory infection and acute renal failure 1 retrospective testing of samples in jordan identified earlier cases from a nosocomial outbreak in april 2012 2 although the majority of mers-cov cases 75 have occurred in saudi arabia 25 other countries have confirmed imported or autochthonously transmitted cases fig 1
 3 4 the most recent and largest outbreak outside of saudi arabia occurred in south korea in may 2015 5 raising concern for an eruption of regional outbreaks or accelerated global spread similar to the phylogenetically related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov that killed nearly a thousand people a decade earlier 6 although the definitive host for mers-cov has not yet been established closely related coronaviruses have been isolated from bats across wide geographic areas 7 8 9 mounting evidence has strongly implicated dromedary camels as the intermediate animal reservoir as serological surveys throughout the middle east and north africa have demonstrated them to have a high prevalence of mers-cov binding or neutralizing abs 10 11 12 13 additionally outbreak investigations have suggested epidemiologic linkage between farm camels and human cases 14 mers-cov is a spherical enveloped single-stranded positive sense rna beta-coronavirus 1 15 its genome contains a replicase locus at the 5 end and codes for structural proteins toward the 3 end the most immunogenic of the viral proteins is spike s a trimeric envelope-anchored type i fusion glycoprotein that interfaces with its human host cognate receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 to mediate viral entry 16 17 s comprises two subunits s1 which contains the receptor-binding domain and determines cell tropism and s2 the location of the cell fusion machinery although dpp4 has a broad tissue distribution most of the clinical manifestations of mers-cov can be attributed to its localization to the lower respiratory tract 18 19 much like other coronaviruses mers-cov can also cause significant dysfunction of the gastrointestinal cardiovascular renal and neurologic systems mers-cov is distinct though in its tendency to cause greatest harm to older individuals with concurrent comorbidities of one or more of these organ-systems 20 21 despite past efforts to develop coronavirus countermeasures in response to the sars-cov pandemic there are currently no prophylactic or therapeutic interventions of proven efficacy for mers-cov or any other coronavirus infection although combination treatment with ribavirin and interferons were shown to improve clinical outcomes in mers-cov-infected non-human primates nhps treatment was initiated very soon after viral challenge 8 h and results have not been replicated in humans 22 in fact no experimental interventions have demonstrated appreciable benefit in acutely ill patients in a consistent or controlled manner rapidly scaled treatments based on naturally occurring neutralizing antibodies such as convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin on the other hand have demonstrated mortality reductions for other respiratory infections and may hold promise for mers-cov as well 23 their development however is limited by logistical challenges local technical capacity and donor supply supportive management adapted from guidelines developed for sars-cov has thus far been the mainstay of mers-cov treatment the global will to develop a coronavirus vaccine faded in the aftermath of sars-cov pandemic but has since gained renewed momentum in the face of the current mers-cov outbreak previous approaches to coronavirus vaccine development were broad and included whole-inactivated and live-attenuated viruses recombinant vectors and protein subunits as well as dna and rna based platforms 6 most developers based their immunogen designs on the s surface glycoprotein the primary target for neutralizing antibodies during any natural coronavirus infection a number of preclinical and clinical studies showed that the sars-cov s1 protein subunit and specifically the rbd at its core could serve as a dominant target for neutralizing antibodies in mice non-human primates and humans 24 s1 therefore became the basis for a number of promising sars-cov vaccine candidates the s1 protein subunit and rbd have also been the basis for several mers-cov vaccine candidates fig 2
 25 26 27 28 29 resolution of rbd crystal structures alone or in complex with the dpp4 receptor 25 30 31 have informed the design of immunogens that have been expressed either as recombinant protein fragments or conjugates to the fragment crystallizable fc region of human antibodies both types of constructs in formulation with aluminum salt or oil-in-water adjuvants have elicited neutralizing antibodies of high potency across multiple viral strains despite their demonstrated immunogenicity in animal models and anticipated safety in humans rbd or s1-subunit based vaccine candidates are limited in their epitope breadth although the coronavirus genomes are not as variable as other rna viruses the rbd is the most mutable region containing mutation sites that define antibody escape variants 25 32 thus vaccine candidates that elicit a more diverse antibody repertoire as well as a robust cellular immune response may offer the advantage of broader and more durable protection full-length s used as an immunogen could at least increase the breadth of the antibody response however it has been difficult to express and may require additional work to produce a stable soluble trimer of the s ectodomain investigators at the university of maryland in collaboration with novavax inc have overcome this problem through the development of s rosettes that are stable and immunogenic in murine models 33 vaccines that mimic natural infection such as live-attenuated viruses or recombinant viral vectors may elicit even more robust immunity live attenuated viruses have historically been among the most immunogenic platforms available as they have the capacity to present multiple antigens across the viral life cycle in their native conformations although a live-attenuated mers-cov has yet to be tested one has been constructed and has the potential to be protective 34 however manufacturing live-attenuated viruses requires containment in a biosafety level 3 or 4 facility additionally live-attenuated viruses carry the hazards of inadequate attenuation or reversion to wild type form and causing disseminated disease particularly in immunocompromised hosts given that moderately immunocompromised adults with co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease have suffered the most severe mers-cov disease these individuals may comprise a target population for immunization thus making a live-attenuated virus vaccine a less viable option replication competent viral vectors could pose a similar threat for disseminated disease in the immunosuppressed replication deficient vectors however avoid that risk while maintaining the advantages of native antigen presentation elicitation of t cell immunity and the ability to express multiple antigens to date two recombinant vector platformsmodified vaccinia virus ankara mva and adenovirus vectorshave been used to express mers-cov s glycoprotein both viral vectors have been immunogenic and one of the mva candidates was protective in a mouse model transduced with human dpp4 35 36 37 38 although replication deficient vectors are relatively safe and immunogenic their ability to deliver genetic material for expression could be impeded by pre-existing or developing immunity to the vector itself one way to overcome this limitation is by administering different vectors in a so-called prime-boost immunization regimen as this strategy has been effective for other pathogens it is likely that the same success could be recapitulated for mers-cov the use of more than one type of platform or antigen in a single vaccine also increases the likelihood of inducing a broad repertoire of antibodies with diverse mechanisms of viral neutralization one vaccine regimen developed at the us national institutes of health is based on full-length s dna and a truncated s1 subunit glycoprotein and has elicited neutralizing antibodies in mice directed at both the s1within and outside the rbdand s2 subunits immunization with these constructs also protected nhps from severe lung disease after intra-tracheal challenge with mers-cov 25 a dna-only vaccine expressing multiple antigens has also been developed by inovio pharmaceuticals and geneone life science inc and has been advanced to a phase i first-in-human trial each of the vaccine candidates that have been mentioned is being developed for prophylactic use however as the total number of cases 1600 3 4 and reproductive rate 07 of mers-cov are both relatively low 39 it will be difficult to define the target populations for vaccination that would support the investment in manufacturing and advanced product development also with such low incidence and lack of robust animal models it would be difficult to achieve a vaccine efficacy result that would be sufficient to support licensure human mabs on the other hand could be used without as much discrimination in an outbreak setting for post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment the advantages of mabs over polyclonal antibodies administered through convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin are their higher potency greater specificity more extensive pre-licensing evaluation and consequently improved safety profile additionally mabs can help define immunogenic epitopes through crystallographic analysis thereby providing atomic level detail for the design of better immunogens however the timeline for mab development may be longer and potentially cost more than some vaccines despite requirements for greater upfront investment several groups have developed highly potent mabs that are currently being advanced through pre-clinical stages of testing fig 3
 some have been isolated from immunized animals micehumanized micenhps 25 40 while others have been identified from either an antibody human phage library 41 42 43 44 or memory b cells of infected and recovered human survivors 45 almost all of the mabs that have been reported target the spike rbd it is likely that mabs directed at other sites on the spike glycoprotein have been recovered but are not as potent neutralizers most of those that have been published bind to recombinant spike with picomolar affinity and neutralize mers-cov pseudovirus at a half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of 01 mcgl or less additionally some have demonstrated protective efficacy in pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis animal models 44 45 the successes thus far in isolating potent and protective mabs may prove useful for therapeutic development where the target population is well defined it may prove more challenging to advancing these products to licensure and full-scale production at affordable costs for the purpose of prophylaxis in as of yet undefined populations the vaguely defined epidemiology of mers-cov has complicated the design and implementation of appropriate public health countermeasures most transmission events have occurred either in the setting of household clusters or nosocomial outbreaks 46 47 48 49 50 51 it is also likely that the virus has been introduced multiple times into human populations from a large zoonotic reservoir ie dromedary camels given the broad distribution and ownership of camels in the arabian peninsula where most cases have occurred a targeted vaccine campaign may prove difficult as the outbreak in the republic of korea revealed patients and workers in the same healthcare facility as an infected patient are at high risk for secondary acquisition an optimal strategy may be to use vaccines in conjunction with stringent infection control practices in hospitals where mers-cov cases are being treated the epidemiologic link of mers-cov between bats camels and humans presents an opportunity for a veterinary vaccine to interrupt the transmission cycle a successful precedent for this so-called onehealth approach toward mitigating human disease with a veterinary vaccine exists in the example of equivac a hendra virus vaccine developed solely for horses 52 although hendra virus is even more rare than mers-cov it is highly fatal with no treatment other than intensive supportive management in 2012 a protein subunit vaccine was licensed and rolled-out in australia where all outbreaks of the virus occurred since that time the incidence in horses has fallen precipitously and no human cases have been detected 53 a similar strategy may be applicable to mers-cov however a veterinary vaccination in this context would be deployed solely for the sake of protecting humans as the virus causes only mild upper respiratory illness in camels safety and reduction in viral shedding would have to be demonstrated in immunization challenge and transmission studies of camel or camelid populations one of which has shown efficacy 54 one of the primary challenges to developing countermeasures to mers-cov is the lack of an appropriate animal model that recapitulates the natural history of human disease much of the difficulty originates from the absence of the viruss cognate dpp4 receptor one group approached this problem by successfully transducing mice with an adenoviral vector expressing human dpp4 55 although more relevant than a standard murine model transient transduction of the desired protein may result in inconsistent tissue expression of adenovirus antigens agrawal et al made an important advance with the development of a transgenic mouse model that demonstrated productive disseminated mers-cov infection 56 although rhesus macaques do not manifest full clinical disease they develop a transient lower respiratory infection that can be quantified and evaluated by computed tomography investigators at the nih rocky mountain laboratories rml and integrated research facility irf have also independently been developing potentially lethal marmoset models that could be used for the evaluation of vaccines mabs and therapeutics 57 as mers-cov vaccinesboth active and passiveare developed and tested not only will more relevant animal models be required but there will also be a need for a more detailed understanding of the epidemiology immunology and pathogenesis of the virus in the aftermath of the west african ebola virus epidemic and in the face of the current zika virus outbreak the global health community has coalesced around the realization that a multi-faceted plan is required to quickly and efficiently respond to global public health emergencies the world health organization is currently developing a blueprint by which that preparation and response can follow with mers-cov highlighted as a case study although mers-cov still causes relatively few cases in a limited geographic distribution its high case fatality and sudden outbreak in in korea have proven it to be a pathogen of public health concern the concentration of the epidemic to saudi arabia also raises the specter of international spread every year during hajj one of the largest mass gathering events in the world ultimately the development of a safe and effective vaccine for mers-cov may not yield its greatest benefit for the current epidemic but for the knowledge gained in creating a platform for combating coronaviruses as a whole the opinions expressed herein are those of the authors and should not be construed as official or representing the views of the us department of defense or the department of the army  recent advances in the vaccine development against middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus chean yong yeah hui ong kian swee yeap keong kok ho lian wen tan siang   camel flu or more commonly known as the middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a respiratory disease caused by mers-coronavirus mers-cov mers-cov was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 zaki et al 2012 as of february 2019 27 countries worldwide have reported cases of mers-cov infection with 2374 reported viral infection and 823 associated deaths which corresponds to 35 fatality in identified cases world health organization who 2019b although the actual fatality rate of the viral infection is most likely below 35 due to some unidentified mild or asymptomatic cases majority of these cases occurred in saudi arabia amounting to 1983 of reported cases with 745 associated deaths or 375 fatality world health organization who 2019a majority of the identified mers-cov cases are nosocomially acquired via direct close contact with infected patients chowell et al 2015 cauchemez et al 2016 whereas cases of zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels to humans were reported primarily in saudi arabia where human-camel interaction is frequent gossner et al 2016 hitherto no specific treatments and vaccines are available for mers-cov infections although mers-cov is currently not listed as a potential pandemic threat a recent outbreak in south korea which demonstrated virus emergence in second and third generation contacts has immediately raised concern that multiple mutations of mers-cov might cause enhanced human-to-human transmission wang et al 2015b oh et al 2018 recently mers-cov was added to the niaids pathogen priority list as category c priority pathogens due to its potential applications in biological warfare du et al 2016b preventive measures against mers-cov infection particularly vaccine development are crucial to avoid deadly and unexpected future pandemics middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus the causative agent of mers is a positive sense single-stranded rna betacoronavirus which belongs to the family of coronaviridae its viral genome is about 30 kb in length flanked by a 5-terminal cap and 3-polya tail van boheemen et al 2012 scobey et al 2013 mers-cov genome contains at least 10 open reading frames orfs which encodes for 4 structural proteins spike s protein envelope e protein membrane m protein nucleocapsid n protein 16 non-structural proteins nsp1-nsp16 and 5 accessory proteins orf3 orf4a orf4b orf5 and orf8b van boheemen et al 2012 du et al 2017 of all these viral proteins s and n proteins are of particular interest in the development of vaccines against mers-cov although other proteins such as e protein and nsp16 are potential immunogens as live attenuated vaccines almazan et al 2013 menachery et al 2017 two viral proteins of mers-cov s and n proteins were demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and capable of eliciting t-cell responses however only s protein was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies the critical effectors against mers-cov agnihothram et al 2014 notably n protein had also been proposed to be a potential protective immunogen for both neutralizing antibodies and t-cell immune responses through in silico approaches shi et al 2015 despite the prediction no biological data have been presented thus far another potential b cell epitope of the mers-cov e protein was identified recently using in silico methods yet similarly no biological data were presented xie et al 2018 therefore most of the mers-cov vaccine candidates are still based on the full length or part of the s protein ideally an effective mers-cov vaccine is required to induce both robust humoral and cell-mediated immunities particularly antibody responses are crucial for the survival of the vaccinated hosts du et al 2016b previous studies indicated that the level of serum neutralizing antibodies correlated positively with the reduction of lung pathogenesis which increased the survival of animals challenged with mers-cov zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in general most of the potential mers-cov vaccine candidates were able to elicit systemic antibody responses producing high titer of serum igg upon immunization but many failed to generate sufficient mucosal immunity unless the vaccines were administered via a mucosal or intranasal route activation of mucosal immunity is heavily dependent on the route of immunization and this is a common challenge in vaccine development for many respiratory pathogens ma et al 2014a guo et al 2015 pre-existing neutralizing mucosal antibodies are important as a first line of defenses against mers-cov infection guo et al 2015 all neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccines based on s protein could bind to the receptor binding domain rbd of the protein thereby inhibiting viral internalization and membrane fusion du et al 2017 little is known about the memory b-cell responses against mers-cov apart from a recent study which demonstrated the persistence of anti-mers-cov antibodies in mers survivors up to 34 months payne et al 2016 on the other hand antibody responses against another closely related coronavirus sars-cov were not persistent whereby a 6-year follow-up study did not detect memory b-cell responses in sars survivors tang et al 2011 it is likely that some of the b-cells differentiate into mers-cov-specific memory b-cells following infection or vaccination but the longevity and protective efficacy of these memory b-cells against mers-cov infection or re-challenge remain unresolved questions du et al 2016b perlman and vijay 2016 t-cell responses elicited by mers-cov vaccines also play important roles in protection against mers this is supported by the fact that viral clearance was impossible in t-cell deficient mice but was possible in mice lacking b-cells zhao et al 2014 although t-cells are demonstrated to be a critical effector in acute viral clearance protection for subsequent mers-cov infection is largely mediated by humoral immunity zhao et al 2014 several animal studies also demonstrated activation of t-cell responses following immunization with a mers-cov vaccine candidate resulting in the elevated secretion of th1 and th2 cytokines lan et al 2014 ma et al 2014a malczyk et al 2015 muthumani et al 2015 it is also noteworthy to mention that adjuvants could be co-administered with mers-cov vaccines to tailor and possibly enhance the immune responses elicited by the vaccines one study has indicated that co-administration of the mers-cov vaccine based on the s protein with alum in mice resulted in a th2 biased immunity whereas a more robust th1 and th2 mixed immune response was produced when an additional adjuvant cysteine-phosphate-guanine cpg oligodeoxynucleotides odn was included in the formulation lan et al 2014 to date no detail investigation on mers-cov vaccine-induced memory t-cell responses is reported however mers-cov infection was shown to induce memory cd4 and cd8 t-cells responses in mers survivors at least up to 24 months zhao et al 2017 there is little understanding about the biological function of memory cd4 t-cells but they are likely to contribute to direct virus inhibition via cytokine production particularly ifn- and enhance the effector functions of cd8 t-cells and b-cells macleod et al 2010 although subsequent mers-cov infection is generally antibody mediated memory cd8 t cells are believed to facilitate virus clearance by eliminating infected cells kaech and ahmed 2001 zhao et al 2017 mers survivors who later demonstrated strong virus-specific memory cd8 t-cell responses were also shown to experience mitigated morbidity during the hospitalization period zhao et al 2017 similarly the importance of t-cell responses against sars-cov was also highlighted in many studies channappanavar et al 2014 chu h et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 interestingly unlike sars-cov mers-cov can infect both the cd4 and cd8 t cells in human resulting in the downregulation of hdpp4 and induced intrinsic and extrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis in t cells which may lead to severe immunopathology chu et al 2016 in addition chu et al 2016 demonstrated the capability of mers-cov in infecting the t cells of common marmosets it is critical for a potential mers-cov vaccine to induce robust humoral and cell-mediated immunities although the protection against mers-cov is mainly mediated by humoral immunity t-cell responses are crucial for acute viral clearance mucosal route is recommended for mers-cov vaccine delivery to induce the mucosal immunity in addition to the systemic responses persistence of the virus-specific antibodies induced by mers-cov vaccine is not thoroughly studied but represents a major challenge an effective mers-cov vaccine is also required to induce immunological memory to provide a long-lived protection which in turn reduces the need of boosters and in the long run will bring down the cost of vaccinations lastly different adjuvants may also be used to improve the immunogenicity of mers-cov vaccines but would require detail studies on the interactions between them to ensure optimal vaccine efficacy and safety so far three potential mers-cov vaccines a dna vaccine and two viral vector-based vaccines have advanced into clinical trials national institutes of health nih 2016 2018b c antibody dependent enhancement ade is a condition whereby non-neutralizing antibodies are produced following an infection or a vaccination which enhance the infectivity of the subsequent infection kuzmina et al 2018 ade of viral infections have been reported for dengue virus human immunodeficiency virus influenza virus other alpha and flaviviruses sars-cov and ebola virus dutry et al 2011 kuzmina et al 2018 thus ade is a critical issue that should be considered seriously in designing a mers-cov vaccine attributed to the taxonomic and structural similarities between sars-cov and mers-cov the processes involved in development of new vaccines against these two viruses to a large extent are similar vaccine candidates against sars-cov were initially developed based on the full-length s protein however these vaccines were later demonstrated to induce non-neutralizing antibodies which did not prevent mers-cov infection and the immunized animals were not protected from the viral challenge instead they experienced adverse effects like enhanced hepatitis increased morbidity and stronger inflammatory responses weingartl et al 2004 czub et al 2005 many potential vaccines against mers-cov were also mainly focused on the same full-length s protein raising a safety concern on the practical application of these vaccines du et al 2016b to date no ade has been observed in mers-cov indeed the ade of sars-cov infection in human cells was only discovered 8 years after the virus was first identified in 2003 yip et al 2011 jaume et al 2012 demonstrated that non-neutralizing antibodies induced by the full-length s protein of sars-cov facilitated the viral entry into host cells via a fcr-dependent pathway our understanding about mers-cov is relatively lesser compared to sars-cov mainly due to the fact that the former was discovered less than 7 years thus it is unsurprising that the ade of mers-cov has yet to be reported du et al 2016b nevertheless by employing appropriate strategies and methods the ade of mers-cov infection could be revealed in the future two approaches have been suggested to mitigate the adverse effects of ade the first approach involves shielding the non-neutralizing epitopes of the s proteins by glycosylation whereas the second approach namely immunofocusing aims to direct the adaptive immune responses to target only the critical neutralizing epitope to elicit a more robust protective immunity du et al 2016a okba et al 2017 a supporting evidence for the latter is that a mers-cov vaccine candidate based on a shorter s1 domain induced slightly stronger neutralizing activity than that based on the full-length s protein in addition a vaccine candidate based on the even shorter rbd induced the highest neutralizing immune responses okba et al 2017 animal models available for evaluation of mers-cov vaccines are highly limited thus representing a huge challenge for vaccine development mers-cov infects the human zaki et al 2012 non-human primates-rhesus macaques de wit et al 2013 munster et al 2013 and marmosets falzarano et al 2014 and dromedary camels alagaili et al 2014 chu dk et al 2014 memish et al 2014 the first animal model adopted for the development of mers-cov vaccine was rhesus macaques de wit et al 2013 munster et al 2013 they demonstrated clinical symptoms of mers-cov infection including an increase in respiratory rate and body temperature hunched posture piloerection cough and reduced food intake radiographic imaging analysis also revealed varying degree of pulmonary diseases following infection although the viral rna of mers-cov was detected in most of the respiratory tissues but viral tropism was restricted primarily to the lower respiratory tract rhesus macaques infected with mers-cov experienced transient mild to moderate disease severity van doremalen and munster 2015 du et al 2016b it is noteworthy that the pathological changes induced in rhesus macaques infected by mers-cov were the results of the host inflammatory responses triggered by the virus instead of the direct viral cytolytic activity prescott et al 2018 the common marmoset is another frequently used animal model to evaluate mers-cov vaccines falzarano et al 2014 similar to rhesus macaques humoral and cell-mediated immunities could be detected in these animals following mers-cov vaccination the common marmosets infected with mers-cov developed moderate to severe acute pneumonia and increased viral load in the respiratory tract in addition to other clinical symptoms experienced by rhesus macaques van doremalen and munster 2015 yu et al 2017 intriguingly the common marmoset also demonstrated signs of renal damage as in human cases following mers-cov infection and the viral rna could be detected in other non-respiratory organs contrary to rhesus macaques van doremalen and munster 2015 yeung et al 2016 falzarano et al 2014 also reported that the common marmoset could serve as a partially lethal animal model similarly chan et al 2015 demonstrated that marmosets challenged with mers-cov developed severe diseases leading to fatality thereafter marmosets have been successfully used as a moderate and severe model to study mers-cov baseler et al 2016 yeung et al 2016 chen et al 2017 van doremalen et al 2017 yu et al 2017 de wit et al 2019 the dromedary camels serve as a natural reservoir for mers-cov and are responsible for zoonotic transmission of the virus to humans mild clinical symptoms such as increase in body temperature and rhinorrhea were observed in the dromedary camels infected with mers-cov adney et al 2014 interesting mers-cov tropism in dromedary camels is limited to the upper respiratory tract and is less apparent in the lower respiratory tract contrary to rhesus macaques adney et al 2014 the viral rnas of mers-cov are detectable in the respiratory tract lymph node and the excreted breath of the infected dromedary camels viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract of the dromedary camels may explain the efficiency of virus transmission among the camels and from camels to humans adney et al 2014 the dromedary camels immunized with mersv-cov vaccines were also shown to activate both the b-cell and t-cell responses muthumani et al 2015 haagmans et al 2016 adney et al 2019 although camels are the natural reservoirs of mers-cov whilst macaques and marmosets are closely related to the human the handling of these large mammals is laborious and costly the lack of small animal models for the initial screening of potential vaccine candidates greatly hampers the development of mers-cov vaccines unlike sars-cov mers-cov does not readily infect smaller rodents such as mice or hamsters due to the substantial differences in the viral binding receptors dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 goldstein and weiss 2017 nevertheless considerable amount of efforts have been devoted to produce mers-cov-permissive small rodents for evaluation of mers-cov vaccines mice transduced by a viral vector to express human dpp4 hdpp4 were shown to be susceptible to mers-cov infection manifested by the development of pneumonia and histopathological changes in the lungs however viral clearance in these infected mice was observed at day-8 post-infection failing to recapitulate severe human diseases zhao et al 2014 later a more established transgenic mouse model expressing hdpp4 globally was developed and it was the first lethal animal model available to evaluate mers-cov vaccines mortality was noted in these mice within days post-infection and virus dissemination to other organs was observed with exceptionally high titer detected in the lung and brain agrawal et al 2015 recently a transgenic mouse model was produced by replacing the full-length mouse dpp4 gene with the human equivalent however these transgenic mice did not demonstrate any sign of diseases following the mers-cov infection and no virus dissemination to other organs was observed pascal et al 2015 crisprcas9 was also previously employed to sensitize the mice to mers-cov infection by substituting two amino acids at positions 288 and 230 of the mouse dpp4 although these genetically engineered mice allowed viral replication in the lungs they did not experience apparent morbidity following infection by the wild-type mers-cov severe diseases were observed only when the mice were infected by mouse-adapted mers-cov generated via 15 serial lung passages cockrell et al 2016 as mouse dpp4 is vital to normal glucose homeostasis and immunity altering the mouse dpp4 could have unforeseen complications to the mouse model fan et al 2018 therefore another transgenic mouse model has been introduced in which the hdpp4 gene was inserted into the genome of c57bl6-mouse at rosa26 locus using the crisprcas9 technology this mouse model namely r26-hdpp4 when infected by mers-cov at low dose developed severe lung diseases related to acute respiratory symptoms ards and central nervous system cns in addition the r26-hdpp4 is also susceptible to infection by a mers-cov pseudovirus serving as an alternative to test mers-cov vaccines in the absence of bsl-3 facility fan et al 2018 all of the animal models described above are summarized in table 1 apart from the mouse model rabbits were also reported to be asymptomatically infected by mers-cov by extensive research these animals could represent another potential animal model to evaluate mers-cov vaccines haagmans et al 2015 smaller animal models are more economically available to vaccine evaluations in addition to the ease of animal manipulation and readily available methods in testing vaccine efficacy as of now sars-cov and mers-cov are the only coronaviruses known to cause severe diseases in human development of sars vaccines was mainly focused on the s protein of sars-cov bukreyev et al 2004 weingartl et al 2004 yang et al 2004 czub et al 2005 kam et al 2007 lin et al 2007 fett et al 2013 to date no vaccine has been licensed to prevent mers-cov infection although several vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials many still remained in the pre-clinical stage current approaches for the development of mers-cov vaccines are mostly referred to the methods used for the development of sars-cov vaccines during the past two decades which include viral vector-based vaccine dna vaccine subunit vaccine virus-like particles vlps-based vaccine inactivated whole-virus iwv vaccine and live attenuated vaccine in general iwv vaccine is the most rapid approach for vaccine production following a new outbreak however the use of iwv as a vaccine in mers was reported to be associated with hypersensitivity-type lung immunopathologic reaction in the mouse model agrawal et al 2015 thereby limiting its potential subunit vaccine is by far the most popular method in the development of mers vaccine mostly focusing on the recombinant rbd of the s protein produced in heterologous expression systems subunit vaccines however are often administered along with adjuvants to boost the immunogenicity of the recombinant antigens nanoparticles such as vlps-based vaccines are similar to subunit vaccines in which only specific viral proteins are expressed unlike subunit vaccines vlps-based vaccines are comprised of recombinant viral proteins capable of self-assembling into larger particles resembling viruses although the immunogenicity of vlps-based vaccines could be enhanced by adjuvants the vlps themselves can serve as adjuvants which increase the immunogenicity of displayed epitopes particularly those of smaller ones murata et al 2003 quan et al 2008 live attenuated vaccines are composed of live viruses which have been modified to remove or reduce their virulence this type of vaccine is often very immunogenic whereby a single administration without an adjuvant is sufficient to induce protective immunity however the risk of reversion to a virulent virus has limited its usage as mers vaccine viral vector-based vaccine is one of the most popular approaches in developing mers vaccines two out of the three candidate vaccines which have entered the clinical phase are viral vector vaccines this approach utilizes well-studied virus replication system to display mers-cov antigen thereby inducing protective immunity against mers-cov another candidate vaccine currently in phase iii clinical trial is a dna vaccine unlike other types of vaccines dna vaccine production does not involve virus replication protein expression and purification therefore reduce the cost of production however administration of dna vaccines often requires an external device such as electroporator or gene gun which eventually increases the cost of immunization table 2 summarizes the vaccine candidates against mers-cov infection which are further discussed intensively in the following sections the first viral vector-based vaccine was reported by moss et al 1984 who developed a potential hepatitis b vaccine using the vaccinia viral vector unlike subunit or inactivated vaccines which generally function as extracellular antigens a viral vector works by carrying a dna encoding immunogenic components into host cells followed by intracellular antigen expression thereby activating a broad spectrum cell-mediated immunity in addition to the humoral immune responses majority of the viral-vector based vaccines do not require adjuvant for optimum efficacy ura et al 2014 adenovirus and modified vaccinia virus ankara mva are the two most common viral vectors used in the development of mers-cov vaccines mice immunized intramuscularly with the recombinant human adenoviral type 5 or 41 vector encoding the full-length s protein were shown to induce systemic neutralizing antibodies and mucosal t-cells immunity intriguingly no mucosal t-cell response was detected when the vaccine was administered via an intragastric route contrary to previous findings which suggested the importance of mucosal vaccination in activating the mucosal immunity guo et al 2015 a recombinant human adenovirus type 5 rad5 vector encoding the shorter s1 extracellular domain of the s protein was reported to elicit slightly stronger neutralizing antibody responses than that encoding the full-length suggesting the effect of immunofocusing kim et al 2014 a recent study by hashem et al 2019 demonstrated that rad5 constructs expressing cd40-targeted s1 fusion protein rad5-s1fcd40l offered a complete protection to hdpp4 transgenic mice against mers-cov challenge and prevented pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage additionally jung et al 2018 showed that heterologous prime-boost vaccination with rad5-s protein and alum-adjuvanted recombinant s protein nanoparticle successfully induced both the th1 and th2 immune responses in specific-pathogen-free balbc mice pre-existing immunity against human adenovirus in human population is widespread hampering its clinical application as a vector for vaccine development fausther-bovendo and kobinger 2014 recent developments of new adenovirus vectors for vaccine antigen delivery focus on the serotype to which human population is less exposed chimpanzee adenovirus chadox1 represents an attractive alternative to the human adenoviral vector due to its good safety profile and lack of pre-existing immunity in human population dicks et al 2012 and has since been employed in the vaccine development against mers-cov infection the recombinant chadox1 encoding full-length s protein chadox1 mers was shown to be immunogenic in mice and lethal virus challenge using hdpp4 transgenic mouse model further demonstrated its high protective efficacy against mers-cov alharbi et al 2017 munster et al 2017 it is noteworthy that the immunogenicity of s protein could be improved by insertion of a gene encoding the signal peptide of human tissue plasminogen activator tpa upstream of the s gene of mers-cov in both chadox1 and mva vectors alharbi et al 2017 currently a candidate mers-cov vaccine known as mers001 which contains the chadox1 encoding the s protein of mers-cov is at phase i clinical trial the trial is estimated to be completed by december 2019 in which the safety and immunogenicity of mers001 at different dosage are being studied in healthy adult volunteers recruited and sponsored by the university of oxford united kingdom national institutes of health nih 2018b recombinant mva encoding the full-length s protein represents another potential mers-cov vaccine candidate due to its good safety profile decent immunogenicity and high protective efficacy against mers-cov song et al 2013 volz et al 2015 alharbi et al 2017 another candidate vaccine currently in phase i clinical trial is mva-mers-s the trial is being performed by the university medical center hamburg-eppendorf germany in which the safety and immunogenicity of mva-mers-s in healthy adult volunteers are being assessed national institutes of health nih 2018c apart from the s protein the highly conserved n protein of mers-cov was inserted into mva and inoculated into mice although the recombinant mva encoding the n-protein elicited cd8 t-cell response in the immunized mice its protective efficacy was not investigated veit et al 2018 apart from adenovirus and mva newcastle disease virus ndv was also used as a viral-vector for displaying mers-cov s protein the ndv-based vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibodies in balbc mice and bactrian camels liu et al 2017 although viral vector-based vaccines are able to induce robust immune responses they are not free from drawbacks which include pre-existing immunity against viral vector risk of pathogenesis low viral titer production and potential tumorigenesis ura et al 2014 dna vaccine is composed of a recombinant plasmid encoding immunogens this vaccine is typically delivered via direct injection gene gun or electroporation into host cells where the immunogens can be expressed and prime the immune system ferraro et al 2011 dna vaccine offers two distinct advantages over the subunit or protein-based vaccine the ease of dna manipulation and low cost of production leitner et al 1999 similarly all dna vaccines developed against mers-cov target the s protein or the shorter s1 domain of mers-cov dna encoding the full-length s protein was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and robust cell-mediated immunity in mice macaques and camels when the immunized macaques were challenged with mers-cov characteristic clinical symptoms including pneumonia were mitigated muthumani et al 2015 gls-5300 is one of the three candidate vaccines currently in a clinical trial sponsored by the geneone life science inc korea a phase i clinical trial to test the vaccines safety profile in human volunteers was completed in the walter reed army institute of research united states national institutes of health nih 2016 currently the phase i and phase ii clinical trials are being performed in the international vaccine institute korea to further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of gls-5300 as well as a device for electroporation cellectra  2000 electroporation national institutes of health nih 2018a to avoid the possible adverse effects induced by the full-length s protein other researchers revealed that immunization with a dna encoding the s1 domain and passive transfer of immune sera from the vaccinated mice protected hdpp4-transduced-mice from mers-cov infection chi et al 2017 the dna encoding the s1 domain was also demonstrated to be more superior than that encoding the full-length s protein in eliciting antibody and cellular responses both dnas encoding the s1 and s proteins were shown to induce neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with mers-cov strains of human and camel origins al-amri et al 2017 despite the effectiveness of dna vaccines spontaneous plasmid integration into host genomes represents a potential risk but the probability is extremely low ledwith et al 2000 in general subunit vaccines have the highest safety profile among all current vaccines despite their low immunogenicities du et al 2016b precautions should be taken during the development of mers-cov vaccines based on the s protein to avoid induction of non-neutralizing antibodies unlike the full-length s protein rbd of mers-cov comprises the critical neutralizing domains but lacking the non-neutralizing immunodominant region therefore upon immunization the rbd-based vaccines are restricted to produce rbd-specific neutralizing immune responses thus are incapable of inducing non-neutralizing antibodies that may potentially contribute to harmful pathological effects du and jiang 2015 wang et al 2015a from the safety and effectiveness perspectives the rbd is a more promising candidate in the development of mers-cov vaccines over the full-length s protein the rbd of mers-cov was reported to induce neutralizing antibodies against multiple strains of mers-cov due to the presence of several conformational neutralizing epitopes du et al 2016b any mers-cov strains with a single mutation in an epitope may not suffice to escape the rbd-specific neutralizing antibodies wang et al 2015a demonstrated that an amino acid mutation at position 509 aspartic acid to glycine substitution in rbd rendered the mutated strain resisted to neutralization by a rbd-specific monoclonal antibody f11 but susceptible to another rbd-specific monoclonal antibody d12 both of these antibodies could bind to different regions of the rbd of mers-cov similarly the rbd of sars-cov also consists of multiple neutralizing domains that are capable of inducing broad neutralizing immune responses against many sars-cov strains he et al 2006 development of antibody escape mutants may require a mutation in two or more epitopes in the rbd of mers-cov which is less likely to take place and if developed may exhibit reduced viral fitness tang et al 2014 tai et al 2017 it was demonstrated that the mers-cov s1 protein with mf59 adjuvant protected hdpp4 transgenic mice against lethal mers-cov challenge where the protection correlated well with the neutralizing antibody titer wang et al 2017c in addition adjuvanted recombinant s1 proteins advax hcxl adjuvant and sigman adjuvant system reduced and delayed virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels mers-cov animal reservoir and provided complete protection in alpaca a surrogate infection model against mers-cov challenge adney et al 2019 in general mers-cov subunit vaccines based on the s1 domain require the use of adjuvant or fusion with an immune enhancer to heighten immunogenicity several studies have indicated that rbd fused with fc fragment of human igg rbd-fc elicited strong systemic neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice du et al 2013 ma et al 2014a tang et al 2015 nyon et al 2018 and new zealand white rabbits ma et al 2014b hdpp4-transduced-mice immunized with rbd-fc were also protected from viral challenge ma et al 2014a other adjuvants such as freunds adjuvant alum monophosphoryl lipid a montanide isa51 and mf59 were also reported to further improve the immunogenicity and protection of rbd-fc in mice particularly mf59 is superior among these adjuvants zhang et al 2016 in addition co-administration of multiple adjuvants together with rbd antigen could synergistically improve the immunogenicity of the rbd-based subunit vaccine mice immunized with rbd antigen together with alum and cpg odn produced stronger humoral and cellular immune responses than those immunized with rbd antigen and alum or cpg odn alone lan et al 2014 rbd-based subunit vaccine was also previously tested in the rhesus macaque model in the presence of alum this vaccine formulation was shown to induce robust and sustained humoral and cellular immunities and partially protected rhesus macaques from viral challenge lan et al 2015 as native spikes of mers-cov exist in the form of trimers vaccine designs mimicking the native viral s proteins have also been reported tai et al 2016 pallesen et al 2017 through the use of foldon fd a t4 fibritin trimerization domain pallesen et al 2017 synthesized a recombinant prefusion trimeric mers-cov s protein which induced high titer of neutralizing antibodies in balbcj mice similarly tai et al 2016 expressed rbd trimers on fd and demonstrated the vaccines protective efficacy 83 survival in hdpp4 transgenic mice against lethal mers-cov challenge although most of the subunit vaccine studies focused on the rbd of the s protein a recent study by jiaming et al 2017 proposed the use of recombinant n-terminal domain rntd of the s protein as another potential vaccine candidate the rntd when used to immunize balbc mice induced neutralizing antibodies and reduced the respiratory tract pathology of mice in a non-lethal mers-cov challenge apart from focusing on the s protein multivalent vaccines designed using in silico methods which contain the b cell and t cell epitopes of s e m n and nsps have been proposed srivastava et al 2018 however until now no biological data have been presented for these multivalent vaccines in addition the n protein and s2 domain of s protein are more conserved among coronaviruses representing other attractive targets in the development of a broad-spectrum coronavirus vaccine schindewolf and menachery 2019 nevertheless it is crucial to ensure that these proteins do not contribute to the ade of mers-cov infection virus-like particles are nanoscale particles similar to the native viral particles but devoid of infectious genetic materials they are composed of repetitive viral structural proteins with inherent self-assembly properties vlps are non-replicative and non-infectious vlps can be produced by expressing the viral structural proteins in a suitable expression system yong et al 2015a b ong et al 2017 in general vlps-based vaccine is similar to the whole inactivated virus vaccine but it does not require the viral inactivation step which may alter the antigenicity and immunogenicity of a viral protein because no live virus is involved in the manufacturing process vlps can be easily generated in a low-containment manufacturing environment dezure et al 2016 virus-like particles of mers-cov were previously produced in baculoviral expression system by co-expressing the s e and m proteins of mers-cov the vlps generated were indistinguishable from the authentic viral particle when observed under an electron microscope these vlps when administered with alum induced neutralizing antibodies and a th1-biased immunity in rhesus macaques wang et al 2017b intriguingly when the s protein of mers-cov was expressed alone it self-assembles into nanoparticles of approximately 25 nm about a quarter of the diameter of the authentic viral particle immunogenicity studies in mice demonstrated that these nanoparticles elicited antibody responses in the presence of alum and when the adjuvant was replaced with matrix m1 adjuvant they induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibodies coleman et al 2014 viral challenge in hdpp4-transduced-mice which had been immunized with matrix m1 and s protein nanoparticles further proven the protective efficacy of this vaccine formulation against mers-cov coleman et al 2017 as mentioned earlier under the viral vector-based vaccine adjuvanted s protein nanoparticles as boosters in mice primed with rad-5 s have also yielded promising th1 and th2 immune responses jung et al 2018 advancement in genetic engineering enables vlps to display different epitopes of viruses producing chimeric vlps cvlps ong et al 2017 expression of the rbd of mers-cov fused to the vp2 structural protein of canine parvovirus cpv produced cvlps displaying the rbd of mers-cov these cvlps were morphologically similar to native cpv and elicited both rbd-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunities in mice wang et al 2017a the cvlps displaying the s protein of mers-cov and matrix 1 protein of influenza a virus were also developed and shown to be immunogenic in mouse models however the actual protective efficacy of these cvlps against mers-cov has yet to be investigated in vivo lan et al 2018 in addition to vaccines based on vlps non-viral nanoparticle such as ferritin has also been reported as a potential carrier for mers-cov antigen kim et al 2018 kim et al 2018 utilized a chaperna-mediated ferritin nanoparticle to display mers-cov rbd when adjuvanted with mf59 the ferritin-based nanoparticle induced rbd-specific antibodies in balbc mice which inhibited rbd binding to hdpp4 receptor protein suggesting its potential use as mers-cov antigen carrier kim et al 2018 inactivated whole-virus comprises the entire disease causing virion which is inactivated physically heat or chemically iwv offers several advantages including relatively low cost of production good safety profile and does not involve laborious genetic manipulation dezure et al 2016 nevertheless production of iwv requires the live virus to be grown under a high-level containment and the antigenicity of the immunogen could be altered in the viral inactivation step dezure et al 2016 formaldehyde-inactivated-mers-cov induced neutralizing antibodies in mice but not t-cell response supplementing this iwv with a combined adjuvant alum and cpg odn was reported to enhance its protective immunity against mers-cov in mice transduced with hdpp4 deng et al 2018 on the other hand an inactivated bivalent whole virus vaccine that targets rabies virus rabv and mers-cov was recently developed using a recombinant vector encoding a fusion protein comprising the mers-cov s1 domain fused to the c-terminus of rabv g protein following expression the s1 domain was incorporated into rabv particles bnsp333-s1 when the mice were immunized with the chemically inactivated bnsp333-s1 robust neutralizing antibody responses against s1 and g proteins were detected inactivated bnsp333-s1 also protected hdpp4-transduced-mice against mers-cov challenge wirblich et al 2017 despite the benefits associated with iwv-based vaccines inactivated mers-cov vaccine was reported to potentially cause a hypersensitivity-type lung immunopathologic reaction upon mers-cov challenge even though it induced neutralizing antibodies and reduced the viral load in hdpp4 transgenic mice similar to those observed in sars-cov agrawal et al 2016 live attenuated vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines due to its capability to induce immunity similar to the natural infection this vaccine contains viable but attenuated virus common approaches to develop a live attenuated vaccine include deletion of the viral genes that confer virulence and via reverse genetic in general live attenuated vaccines are highly immunogenic thus do not require adjuvant for optimal efficacy and single immunization is usually sufficient to induce protective immunity nevertheless live attenuated vaccines come with some unwanted limitations particularly the risk of reversion to a virulent strain and the absolute need for vaccine cold chain live attenuated vaccine is also not suitable for infants immunocompromised individuals and elderly people lauring et al 2010 a live attenuated vaccine against mers-cov was previously developed by deleting the e gene of mers-cov rmers-cov-e this engineered virus lacked infectivity and replicated in a single cycle vaccines based on the live attenuated viruses could pose biosafety problems associated with the risk of virulence reversion whereas rmers-cov-e is propagation defective in the absence of e protein preventing a straightforward reversion to virulence thus providing a safer alternative almazan et al 2013 more recently a live attenuated mers-cov was generated through mutation of nsp16 d130a where the attenuated virus protected crispr-cas9-targeted 288330 c57bl6 mice from a mouse-adapted mers-cov challenge menachery et al 2017 other than mers-cov a replication competent recombinant measles virus mv was used as a platform for the development of live attenuated mers-cov vaccine the recombinant mv was engineered to express the full-length s protein mvvac2-cov-s or its truncated version mvvac2-cov-sols both mvvac2-cov-s and mvvac2-cov-sols were shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses against mv and mers-cov and protected hdpp4-transduced-mice from mers-cov challenge malczyk et al 2015 three years later bodmer et al 2018 compared the mvvac2-cov-s with its uv-inactivated derivative and showed that the inactivated version did not induce any specific immune response against both the mv and mers-cov concurrently bodmer et al 2018 constructed a live attenuated recombinant mv expressing mers-cov n protein mvvac2-mers-n and its administration into ifnar-cd46ge mice genetically modified mice deficient of type i ifn receptor and transgenically expressing human cd46 induced n-specific t cell responses although not as strong as those of mvvac2-cov-s similarly in another study a viable recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vsv with its g protein replaced with the s protein of mers-cov also elicited both humoral and cell-mediated immunities in rhesus macaques liu et al 2018 development of mers vaccines started immediately following the discovery of mers-cov in 2012 pre-clinical trials on animal models capable of recapitulating the clinical signs and symptoms in the human are a must prior to clinical trials and licensing of a vaccine gerdts et al 2007 the choice of an animal model is generally preferable to be as phylogenetically closer as possible to the human swearengen 2018 therefore majority of the vaccine candidates will be evaluated in non-human primates such as chimpanzees rhesus macaques sibal and samson 2001 or marmosets carrion and patterson 2012 employing these animal models in experiments however is extremely costly gerdts et al 2015 before involving non-human primates in a vaccine evaluation strong justification or supporting evidence from in vitro analysis or more preferable from animal studies such as small rodents are often required gerdts et al 2015 however mers-cov cannot infect smaller rodents naturally representing a huge challenge in initial vaccine developments goldstein and weiss 2017 although transgenic mouse models for evaluation of mers-cov vaccines have been successfully developed the costs of these transgenic animals are not affordable by many research groups especially those from the less affluent parts of the world this issue consequently delayed the development of an effective vaccine and its advancement into clinical trial funding is the primary drivers in any vaccine developments many vaccines demonstrating promising results at the pre-clinical stage require additional investments from the government or the private industry to advance into clinical trials hakoum et al 2017 however government funding for clinical trials is rather restricted whereas private industry is generally profit oriented of which the market size and potential profits are of priority smith 2000 unlike other widespread diseases such as hepatitis and influenza mers cases are primarily reported in saudi arabia apart from the korea outbreak gossner et al 2016 its relatively low occurrence is likely to limit the market size of mers vaccines leading to lower interest by the private funding bodies although three potential mers vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical trials they are currently in phase iii as completing the entire trials often take 10 years and above they are unlikely to be commercially available in the coming 35 years despite having a low occurrence of recorded human-to-human transmission the recent mers outbreak in south korea which demonstrated virus emergence in second and third generation contacts has reignited public awareness regarding the danger of mers-cov as no effective treatment against mers is currently available therefore the best solution is to develop a functional mers vaccine to prevent mers-cov infection amongst the six types of vaccines discussed above more studies are focused on the viral vector-based and subunit vaccines even though many promising vaccine candidates have been proposed and reported as of now only three potential mers-cov vaccine candidates have progressed to phase i clinical trials a dna vaccine gls-5300 and two viral vector-based vaccines mva-mers-s and mers001 it is still very likely that no mers vaccine will be available in the market for human in the near future therefore considerable efforts should be given to minimize delays in executing clinical trials such as better understanding and coordination between sponsors primary investigators investigators participants and stakeholders cy and ho wrote the manuscript sy kh and wt reviewed edited and approved its final version the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest  covid-19 an emerging coronavirus infection advances and prospects in designing and developing vaccines immunotherapeutics and therapeutics kuldeep dhama khan sharun ruchi tiwari maryam dadar yashpal malik singh karam singh pal wanpen chaicumpa   coronaviruses covs are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses of the family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae that infect a wide host range to produce diseases ranging from common cold to severefatal illnesses the novel virus was initially named 2019-ncov which was changed to sars-cov-2 by the coronavirus study group csg of international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv since it was found to be the sister virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov1 the ongoing coronavirus threat that emerged in china has rapidly spread to other countries and has been declared as a global health emergency by the world health organization who many nations are diverting their best efforts for the implementation of appropriate preventive and control strategies neither vaccines nor direct-acting antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of human and animal coronavirus infections2-4 many efforts have been directed to develop vaccines against human cov infections in recent decades but a limiting factor is the degree of cross-protection rendered by these vaccines due to their extensive sequence diversity5 various vaccines immunotherapeutics and drug options have been explored during the recent threats of zika ebola and nipah viruses6-8 as well as against previous covs including sars- and mers-covs359-12 these valuable options can be exploited for their potency efficacy and safety along with expediting other ongoing research2413-15 so as to discover valuable modalities for tackling the emerging covid-19 but as yet there is no effective vaccine or therapeutic for which intense efforts are ongoing most of the therapeutic options that are available for managing covid-19 are based on previous experiences in treating sars- and mers-cov a major reason for the lack of approved and commercially available vaccines or therapeutic agents against these covs might be the relative lack of interest among the pharmaceutical companies13 these are outbreak scenarios the demand for drugs or vaccines lasts only for a period while the outbreak lasts the number of affected people will also be a small proportion of the global drug and vaccine market so by the time a new drug or vaccine is developed there might not be any patients for clinical trials and also no meaningful market for newly discovered drugs according to who guidelines infected patients will receive supportive care including oxygen therapy fluid therapy and antibiotics for treating secondary bacterial infections the who also recommends the isolation of patients suspected or confirmed for covid-1916 the major therapeutic drugs that might be effective in managing covid-19 include remdesivir lopinavirritonavir alone or in combination with interferon- convalescent plasma and mabs17 nevertheless before utilizing these drugs for covid-19 pneumonia patients clinical efficacy and safety studies should be conducted this article describes advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter covid-19 while also discussing experiences with sars- and mers-covs which together could pave ways in the right direction to halt this emerging virus multiple strategies are adopted in the development of cov vaccines most of these target the surface-exposed spike s glycoprotein or s protein as the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies several s-protein-based strategies have been attempted for developing cov vaccines eg use of full-length s protein or s1-receptor-binding domain rbd and expression in virus-like particles vlp dna or viral vectors5918-21 the s protein molecule contains two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit has an rbd that interacts with its host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 whereas the s2 subunit mediates fusion between the virus and host cell membranes for releasing viral rna into the cytoplasm for replication19 hence s-protein-based vaccines should induce antibodies that block not only viral receptor binding but also virus genome uncoating it has been shown that the c-terminal domain of the s1 subunit of porcine deltacoronavirus constitutes the immunodominant region and the immune response to this region shows the most potent neutralizing effect22 the s protein has a major role in the induction of protective immunity during infection with sars-cov by eliciting neutralizing-antibodies and t-cell responses19 thus full-length or appropriate parts of the s glycoprotein are believed to be the most promising candidate cov vaccine composition it was also reported that neither the absence nor presence of the other structural proteins affects s protein immunogenicity or its binding to the ace2 receptor that is a critical initial step for virus to access into the host cell2324 due to the superior ability of rbd to induce neutralizing antibody both recombinant proteins that contain rbd and the recombinant vectors that encode rbd can be used for developing the effective sars-cov vaccines18 recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine expressing mers-cov s protein induces systemic igg secretory iga and lung-resident memory t-cell responses when administered intranasally into balbc mice and provide long-lasting neutralizing immunity to mers spike pseudotyped virus thereby suggesting that the vaccine may confer protection against mers-cov24 furthermore rabies virus rv as a viral vector as well as gram-positive enhancer matrix gem as a bacterial vector has been used to express mers-cov s protein the immune responses to these vaccine candidates were evaluated in balbc mice for cellular and humoral immune responses which showed that rv-based vaccine stimulates significantly higher levels of cellular immunity and earlier antibody responses in comparison to the gem particle vector12 the possibility of developing a universal cov vaccine was assessed based on the similarity in t-cell epitopes of sars- and mers-cov that confirmed the potential for cross-reactivity among covs25 sars-cov-2 shares high genetic similarity with the sars-cov26 such that vaccines developed for sars-cov may exhibit cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2 the comparative evaluation performed on full-length s protein sequences of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov identified that the most variable residues were located in the s1 subunit of s protein the critical cov vaccine target27 these findings suggest that the specific neutralizing antibodies that are effective against the sars-cov might not be effective against the sars-cov-2 even though the s protein of sars-cov-2 has key mutations compared to the sars-cov they will still act as a viable target for vaccine development28 likewise the close similarity of sars-cov-2 to the sars-cov suggests that the receptor of sars-cov-2 might be the same as that of sars-cov receptor ace229 immuno-informatics approach can be used for the identification of epitopes for inclusion in covid-19 vaccine candidates recently immuno-informatics was used to identify significant cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl and b-cell epitopes in sars-cov-2 s protein the interactions between these epitopes and their corresponding mhc class i molecules were studied further by using molecular dynamics simulations and found that the ctl epitopes bind with mhc class i peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts thus indicating their potential for generating immune responses30 such epitopes may possess the ideal characteristics to become part of covid-19 vaccine candidates the nucleocapsid n protein as well as the potential b cell epitopes of the e protein of mers-cov has been suggested as probable immuno-protective targets that induce both t-cell and neutralizing antibody responses3132 reverse genetic strategies have been successfully used in live-attenuated vaccines to inactivate the exonuclease effects of non-structural protein 14 nsp14 or to delete the envelope protein in sars5 avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv is a chicken cov it was suggested that avian live virus ibv vaccine strain h might be useful for sars33 given that protection provided by strain h is based on neutralizing antibody production as well as other immune responses hence avian ibv vaccine may be considered another option for covid-19 after evaluating its safety in monkeys34 scientists of rocky mountain laboratories are collaborating with oxford university to develop a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored covid-19 vaccine candidate35 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi recently announced the initiation of three programs aimed to develop covid-19 vaccines by utilizing established vaccine platforms36 among the three programs two are continuations of previously initiated partnerships cepi collaborated with inovio in 2018 to developing dna vaccine candidates for mers 56 m funding the vaccine in development utilizes dna medicines platform for delivering synthetic genes into cells for translation into antigenic proteins which elicit t-cell and antibody responses cepi has collaborated with the university of queensland in 2019 to develop the molecular clamp vaccine platform against multiple viral pathogens including mers-cov 10 m funding the vaccine platform functions by synthesizing viral surface proteins that get attached to the host cells and clamp them into shape this facilitates easier recognition of antigens by the immune system36 other than these ongoing programs cepi has announced funding to moderna for comparing mrna therapeutics and vaccines they will design and manufacture an mrna vaccine in collaboration with the vaccine research center vrc of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid a part of the national institutes of health nih37 niaid-vrc scientists are developing a vaccine candidate expressing sars-cov-2 s protein in the mrna vaccine platform technology this vaccine is expected to undergo clinical testing in the coming months35 direct administration of monoclonal antibodies mabs may play an effective role in cov control as an intervention in exposed individuals it has been observed that patients recovering from sars display potent neutralizing antibody responses9 a clinical trial proposed the use of a set of mabs that functionally target specific domains in mers-cov s protein these mabs bind to six specific epitope groups interacting with the receptor binding membrane fusion and sialic acid-binding sites which represent the three important entry functions of mers-cov s protein2138 moreover passive immunization with poorly and potently neutralizing antibodies induces substantial protection in mice subjected to lethal mers-cov challenge thus use of these antibodies may represent a novel approach to increase humoral protection against emerging covs by targeting various s protein epitopes and functions the cross-neutralization capacity of sars-cov rbd-specific neutralizing mabs greatly depends on the similarity between their rbds this is why sars-cov rbd-specific antibodies can cross-neutralize sars-like sl covs ie bat-sl-cov strain wiv1 rbd that had 8 amino acid differences to sars-cov but not bat-sl-cov strain shc014 24 amino acid differences39 such cross-neutralizing sars-cov rbd-specific mabs can be evaluated for efficacy with sars-cov-2 this requires a comparative analysis of sars-cov-2 rbd with sars-cov so that suitable rbd-specific mabs can be identified and evaluated in clinical trials regeneron is trying to identify mabs specific and effective for covid-19 combination therapy with mabs and the drug remdesivir could be an ideal therapeutic option for covid-1940 further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy technology is available for making fully human antibodies such as human single-chain antibodies hu-scfvs or humanized-nanobodies single-domain antibodies sdab vhvhh that can traverse across the membrane of the virus-infected cells trans bodies and bind to or interfere with biological activities of replicating virus proteins which consequently leads to inhibition of virus replication examples include trans bodies to influenza virus hepatitis c virus ebola virus and dengue virus41 thus it is possible to generate trans bodies to cov intracellular proteins such as the papain-like proteases plpro cysteine-like protease 3clpro or other non-structural proteins nsps that are pivotal for cov replication and transcription for safe non-immunogenic broadly effective passive immunization of cov-exposed subjects and treatment of infected patients suitable animal models for evaluating vaccines for sars- and mers-cov are lacking or highly limited making the process of vaccine development highly challenging4243 development of an efficient animal model that mimics the clinical disease can inform on pathogenesis as well as to develop vaccines and therapeutics against these covs several animal models have been evaluated for sars- and mers covs including mouse guinea pigs hamsters ferrets rabbits rhesus macaques marmosets and cats4244-50 early effort was directed in developing animal models for sars-cov but the specificity of the virus to ace2 receptor of sars-cov was a major hindrance to such efforts later a sars-cov transgenic mouse model was developed by introducing hace2 gene into the mouse genome51 the first animal model used for developing a mers-cov vaccine was rhesus macaques infected animals showed clinical symptoms such as increased body temperature piloerection cough hunched posture and reduced food intake52 another frequently used animal model for mers-cov is the common marmoset wherein the virus caused lethal pneumonia53 humoral and cell-mediated immunity could be detected in both rhesus macaques and common marmoset following mers-cov immunization435253 roberts et al established golden syrian hamsters strain lvg as a model to assess vaccine protection to different sars-cov strains47 these hamsters are a potential model for studying cov pathology and pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy the attenuated nsp16 cov vaccine was studied in mice54 attempts to develop animal models for mers-cov such as mice hamsters and ferrets face limitations due to the inability of mers-cov to replicate in the respiratory tracts of these species small animals mice or hamsters resisting natural infection with mers-covs which are susceptible to sars-cov have been genetically modified to a more humanized structure eg hdpp4 human hdpp4-transduced and hdpp4-tg mice transgenic for expressing hdpp4 and ascertained for susceptibility to mers-cov infection55 alteration in the mouse genome using the crispr-cas9 gene-editing tool could make the animals susceptible to cov infection and virus replication56 genetic engineering was used in the generation of 288330 mers-cov mouse model which is being used for the evaluation of novel mers-cov vaccines and drugs57 compared to the large animal models small animals such as mice and rabbits are preferred due to lower cost ease of manipulation and readily available efficacy methods43 further studies are needed to recognize suitable models for emerging sars-cov-2 by identifying receptor affinity of sars-cov-2 and studying disease manifestations pathologiesviral pathogenesis associated with experimental inoculation of the virus in mice rats and other models as well as examining virus-specific immune responses and protection this would facilitate preclinical evaluations of candidate covid-19 vaccines and drugs several permissive cell lines to hcovs including monkey epithelial cell lines llc-mk2 and vero-b4 have been used in neutralization assays for assessing neutralization titers of antibody preparations goat lung cells alpaca kidney cells and dromedary umbilical cord cells have been found to be permissive for mers-cov58 sars-cov s protein has been found to mediate entry into hepatoma cell lines targeted by neutralizing antibodies in virus-infected patients59 advanced exvivo 3d tracheobronchial tissue mimicking epithelium of conductive airway has been used for human covs60 moreover vlps displaying sars-cov s protein were found competent for entry to permissive cells or transfected cells that overexpress virus receptors596162 sars-cov-2 isolation has been attempted in vero and the huh-7 cells human liver cancer cells63 pseudotyped virionsvlps encoding reporter systems such as gfp or luciferase can be used for quantification and evaluation of the effectiveness of mabs and drugs in inhibiting the cellular entry of covs64 assays using pseudotyped virionsvlps can be performed in bsl-2 facility since these do not use infectious virus a safety concern for passive immunization with antibodies is a possible antibody-dependent enhancement ade of virus replication antibodies with modified fc fragments or without fc fragment eg human single-chain antibodies scfv fab or fab2 are safe alternatives several mabs fully human or humanized that target both the s1-rbd and non-rbd as well as s2 domain of covs have been generated and tested in cell cultures for virus-neutralizing capability as well as in animal models for prophylactic and post-exposure efficacies65 these antibodies could be useful tools also in the development of vaccines therapeutic drugs and antiviral inhibitors data from animal cov vaccination suggest that systemic humoral or cell-mediated immune responses induced by parenteral administration may not be adequate to prevent respiratory tract infection66 because respiratory mucosa is the initial site in cov infection and transmission mucosal immunization such as using intranasal vaccine67 could be an effective strategy for prophylaxis by induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses the molecular mechanisms of mucosal and systemic immunological factors are different such that it is difficult to predict the surrogate marker for cov efficacy the best surrogate assays for protection as well as herd immunity toward different cov infections warrant detailed investigations the main measure in clinical management is focused on alleviating clinical symptoms and supportive care68-70 therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for covid-19 include molecules binding to the virus molecules or inhibitors that target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription small-molecule inhibitors targeting helicase essential proteases or other proteins of the virus host cell protease inhibitors host cell endocytosis inhibitors sirna anti-sense rna and ribozyme neutralizing antibodies mabs targeting host receptor or interfere with s1 rbd antiviral peptide targeting s2 and natural products211 there is a long list of anti-cov agents mostly preclinical compounds yet to be evaluated as anti-covid-19 agents some of these agents are in phase iii trials for covid-19 including remdesivir oseltamivir asc09f hiv protease inhibitor lopinavir ritonavir darunavir and cobicistat71 many existing mers- andor sars-covs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp sequence of sars-cov-2 has shown 96 identity to that of sars-cov a critical finding since drugs developed for sars-cov rdrp might show similar efficacy for sars-cov-2 rdrp28 s protein is considered the major target for designing cov antiviral therapies such as s protein inhibitors s cleavage inhibitors neutralizing antibodies rbdace2 blockers sirnas fusion core blockers and protease inhibitors19 all such therapeutic strategies have shown potential in vitro andor in vivo anti-cov activities comparatively even though in vitro studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials hence of limited use for covid-19 hence the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful the binding of covid-19 and ace2 affects the balance of reninangiotensin system ras potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia thus it is speculated that acei and angiotensin type-1 receptor at1r inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses thereby reducing the mortality72 the guidance to covid-19 control might be based on existing measures for mers and sars with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new cov1473 the main treatments such as mechanical ventilation icu admission and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases furthermore rna synthesis inhibitors like 3tc tdf remdesivir neuraminidase inhibitors peptide ek1 anti-inflammatory drugs abidol chinese traditional medicine such as lianhuaqingwen and shufengjiedu capsules could be the promising covid-19 treatments2 however further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for covid-19 a major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time it may take months to even several years for researchers to develop produce standardize evaluate approve and commercialize therapeutic agents for covid-19 hence current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to covid-19 the time required for drug discovery programs to develop evaluate and obtain approval for a new potent anti-covid-19 agent could take more than 10 years4 in the present scenario the development of a new therapeutic agent for covid-19 is not a feasible option with regard to available time another option is to repurpose broadly acting antiviral drugs used for other viral infections such drugs have the advantage of easy availability known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties solubility stability side effects and also well-established dosing regimens4 repurposed drugs are potential therapeutic options managing cov infections repurposed drugs such as lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1 possess in vitro anti-mers-cov activity the in vivo study conducted in common marmosets non-human primate model showed that animals treated with lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1 had better outcomes than untreated animals74 the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-1 is being evaluated for mers in the miracle trial75 the same two protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir when combined with ribavirin were found to be associated with favorable clinical responses in sars patients indicating therapeutic efficacy10 as an early attempt to evaluate these repurposed drugs in covid-19 a controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and interferon- 2b therapy has been registered for hospitalized patients in china chictr200002930876 oral administration of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir has been used as an empirical drug for covid-19 suspected cases in china hospitals even though there is no evidence of its efficacy2 recently the in vitro antiviral efficacy of approved drugs such as ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat and chloroquine was compared with that of the two broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipiravir for covid-19 among the evaluated drugs both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling covid-19 in vitro63 the study also pointed out that the three nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin penciclovir and favipiravir may not have significant in vivo antiviral effects against covid-19 since higher concentrations were required to reduce the viral infection in vitro both remdesivir and chloroquine are being used for the treatment of other diseases and have a well-defined safety profile hence such drugs can be used for evaluating their efficacy in patients of novel cov infections achievements in the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents for sars- and mers-cov as well as recent ongoing progress for covid-19 will facilitate the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against this emerging virus however the present scenario of covid-19 warrants the need for implementing robust preventive and control measures due to the potential for nosocomial infections77 we need to rely exclusively on preventive measures since considerable time is required before efforts to develop a new vaccine or antiviral agent becomes fruitful researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly covid-19 there are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for covid-19 hence we have to rely exclusively on enforcing strict preventive and control measures that minimize the risk of possible disease transmission results obtained from the recently conducted in vitro study against covid-19 are promising since the drugs remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling the infection direct clinical trials can be conducted among the patients infected with covid-19 since these drugs are being used for treating other diseases and have well-established safety profiles making the further evaluation of these drugs much easier s protein is considered a key viral antigen for developing cov vaccines as shown in several preclinical studies although research is in progress to improve prevention treatment and control of covid-19 the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for covs are scarce further research should be directed toward the study of sars-cov-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication transmission and pathogenesis  potential t-cell and b-cell epitopes of 2019-ncov ethan nash fast binbin chen  as of feb 16th 2020 2019-ncov has infected more than 51857 people across 26 countries and claimed 1666 lives 2019-ncov is a novel form of coronavirus that causes covid-19 and has high similarity with sars-cov no approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-ncov or any form of coronavirus here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-ncov t-cell and b-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties these epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies we identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles and two potential neutralizing b-cell epitopes near the 2019-ncov spike protein receptor binding domain 440-460 and 494-506 analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents we identified 96 coding-change mutations these mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good mhc-i presentation scores p002 no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain we validated our computational pipeline with sars-cov experimental data both humoral immunity provided by b-cell antibodies and cellular immunity provided by t-cells are essential for effective vaccines 10 11  though humans can usually mount an antibody response  cc-by-nc 40  coronaviruses cov first became widely known after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 they are are positive single-strand rna viruses that often infect birds and a variety of mammals and sometimes migrate to humans 1  while coronaviruses that infect humans usually present mild symptoms eg 15 of cases involving the common cold are caused by a coronavirus several previous outbreaks such as sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 2  have caused significant fatalities in infected populations 3  in december 2019 several patients with a connection in wuhan china developed symptoms of viral pneumonia sequencing of viral rna determined that these cases were caused by a novel coronavirus named 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 4 5  the virus has infected more than 51857 people across 26 countries as of february 16th 2020 according to a world health organization report 6  covid-19 the disease caused by 2019-ncov has led to death of 1666 patients and is clearly transmissible between humans 3  the deployment of a vaccine against 2019-ncov would arrest its infection rate and help protect vulnerable populations however no vaccine has yet passed beyond clinical trails for any coronavirus whether in humans or other animals 7 8  in animal models inactivated whole virus vaccines without focused immune epitopes offer incomplete protection 8  vaccines for sars-cov and mers-cov have also resulted in hypersensitivity and immunopathologic responses in mice 9 7  the diversity among coronavirus strains presents another challenge 9 1  as there are at least 6 distinct subgroups in the coronavirus genus and while sars-cov and 2019-ncov share the same subgroup 2b their genomes are only 77 identical 4  understanding the shared and unique epitopes of 2019-ncov will help the field design better vaccines or diagnostic tests for patients orfs  the s protein is a target for antibodies and we model its 3d structure with discotope2 to identify likely binding sites b-cell epitopes we scan peptide sequences from individual viral protein with netmhcpan4 and maria for mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation respectively to identify potential t-cell epitopes our mhc-i analysis include common alleles for hla-a hla-b and hla-c and our mhc-ii analysis include common alleles of hla-dr against viruses only neutralizing antibodies can fully block the entry of viruses into human cells 12  the location of antibody binding sites on a viral protein strongly affects the bodys ability to produce neutralizing antibodies for example hiv has buried surface proteins that protect themselves from human antibodies 13  for this reason it would be valuable to understand whether 2019-ncov has potential antibody binding sites b-cell epitopes near their interacting surface with its known human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 beyond neutralizing antibodies human bodies also rely upon cytotoxic cd8 t-cells and helper cd4 t-cells to fully clear viruses the presentation of viral peptides by human major histocompatibility complex mhc or hla class i and class ii is essential for anti-viral t-cell responses 14  in contrast to b-cell epitopes t-cell epitopes can be located anywhere in a viral protein since human cells can process and present both intracellular and extracellular viral peptides 15  these immunology principles guide the design of our current study fig 1  first we focus on t-cell epitopes 2019-ncov carries 4 major structural proteins-spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n-and at least 6 other open reading frames orfs 1 16  all protein fragments have the potential to be presented by mhc-i or mhc-ii and recognized by t-cells we apply netmhcpan4 17 and maria 15  two artificial neural network algorithms to predict antigen presentation and identify potential t-cell epitopes next we focus on b-cell epitopes the spike s protein is the main trans-membrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of 2019-ncov and is responsible for receptor binding and virion entry to cells 1 18  we narrow our b-cell epitope search to s protein since it is the most likely target of human neutralizing antibodies discopte2 uses a combination of amino acid sequences and protein surface properties to predict antibody binding sites given a protein structure 19  we use this tool to identify potential 2019-ncov b-cell epitopes as the co-crystal structure of 2019-ncovs spike protein and antibody is yet available finally we examine the viral mutation pattern thanks to global sequencing efforts 20  we are able to obtain a cohort of 68 2019-ncov genomes from four continents based on the resulting viral mutation profile we examine whether mutations are driven by the immune selection pressure highly mutated regions might be excluded from the vaccine candidate pool we obtained 2019-ncov sars-cov-2019 and sars-cov reference sequence data from ncbi genebank nc045512 and nc004718 16 4  we then extracted the 2019-ncov protein sequences of orf1ab s orf3a e m orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 n and orf10 based on the reference genome we obtained viral sequences associated with 68 patients from gisaid on feb 1st 2020 supplementary table 1  20  genomes with single protein are not included in the analysis we broke each gene sequence in 2019-ncov into sliding windows of length 9 the median length of mhc-i ligands and 15 the median length of mhc-ii ligands we used netmhcpan4 17 and maria 15 to predict mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation scores respectively we used 32 mhc alleles common in the chinese population 4 allele frequency 7 hla-a 8 hla-b 9 hla-c 8 hla-drb1 as determined by an analysis of human populations 21  the complete list of common mhc alleles is included in supplementary table 2  both maria and netmhcpan4 return percentiles that characterize a peptides likelihood of presentation relative to preset distribution of random human peptide scores prior work recommends thresholds of 98 for netmhcpan4 and 95 for maria to determine reasonable presenters we also applied our analysis with a more stringent 995 threshold for both netmhcpan4 and maria we used gene expression values of 50 tpm when running maria to reflect the high expression values of viral genes in human cells when aggregating alleles across mhc-i and mhc-ii to report overall coverage we marked a peptide sequence as covered if it is presented by more then 33 of common alleles we chose 33 as a cut-off because it suggests a high 90 probability that at least one allele can present this peptide assuming the patient carries six mhc alleles eg 2 as 2 bs and 2 cs and the distribution of common mhc alleles in the population is random we ranked potential t-cell epitopes based on their mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation coverage across alleles we applied our methodology to known sars t-cell epitopes and non-epitope sars peptides to estimate our ability to predict 2019-ncov epitopes for mhc-i we curated 17 experimentally determined hla-a0201 associated cd8 t-cell epitopes and 1236 non-epitope 9mer sliding windows on sars s protein 22 23 24  for mhc-ii we curated 3 experimentally determined cd4 t-cell epitopes and 246 non-epitopes on sars s protein 25  no specific hla-dr alleles were reported in the original study so we used hla-drb10901 and 1501 common alleles to run maria to calculate sensitivity and specificity for this validation set we labeled any peptide sequence above the 98th mhc-i or 95th mhc-ii percentile as a positive epitope prediction any sequence below that threshold we labeled as a negative prediction we calculated auc scores auroc to estimate the overall performance of our methodology we obtained an approximate 3d structure of 2019-ncov s protein by homology modeling sars s protein pdb 6acc with swiss-model 26 27  s proteins from 2019-ncov and sars share 93 similarity the modeled structure of 2019-ncov s protein has a qmean of -363 table 1  summary of potential 2019-ncov t-cell epitope candidates based on hla antigen presentation scores the hla-a hla-b hla-c and hla-dr columns refer to the number of peptide sequences that were predicted to present across more than one third of common alleles among the chinese population length refers to the number of amino acids in a given gene hla-c are more likely to present 2019-ncov antigens across one third of alleles compared to hla-a or b fishers exact test p-value levels are indicated with     0001    001 and   005 supplementary file 1 we used a computational docking algorithm cluspro2 28  to estimate the interactive surface of 2019-ncov with its known human receptor ace2 5 supplementary file 2 graphic rendering and analysis was performed with pymol 29  we predicted likely human antibody binding sites b-cell epitopes on sars and 2019-ncov s protein with disctope2 19  our analysis focused on neutralizing binding sites by only examining residues 1-600 the full prediction results can be found in supplementary  we aimed to determine whether there was any statistical relationship between regions of mutation and presentation we translated viral genome sequences into protein sequences using biopython 33 and indexes from the ncbi reference genome 2019-ncov nucleotide position 13468 contains a -1 frame shift signal and we adjusted accordingly to generate orf1ab we compared protein sequences from 68 patients to the reference sequence to identify mutations with edit distance analysis positions with poor quality reads eg w or y were excluded from the analysis the full sequence and mutation profiles can be found in supplementary  we computed fishers exact test with scipy 34 and auroc with scikit-learn 35  we scanned 11 2019-ncov genes with netmhcpan4 and maria to identify regions highly presentable by hla complexes human mhc a epitope is labeled positive if presentable by more than one third of common alleles among the chinese population we display a summary of our t-cell epitope findings in table 1  in fig 2 we show regions of strong mhc presentation across hla-a hla-b hla-c and hla-dr alleles both at a medium threshold  fig 2a  and at a high threshold  fig 2b  consistent with the similar finding from sars-cov proteins orf1ab s and e contain high numbers of presentable antigen sequences across both mhc-i and mhc-ii 8  these highly presentable peptides on functional viral proteins provide a candidate pool for t-cell epitope identifications and epitope-focused vaccine design the presentation scores of individual antigen peptides can be found in supplementary table 5 6 netmhcpan4 predicts that a larger number of 2019-ncov protein sequences can be presented by hla-c alleles across all genes fishers exact test p  42e 59  compared to hla-a or hla-b table 1  specifically orf1ab p  67e 54  s p  14e 9  orf3a p  001 and m p  0025 can be better presented by hla-c alleles after bonferroni correction this might be due to relatively conserved hla-c binding motif on the 9th position the main anchor residue where leucine methionine phenylalanine tyrosine are commonly favored across alleles 36  hla-c0702 hla-c0102 and hla-c0602 all have 10 allele frequency in the chinese population 21  this suggests the future epitope-based vaccines should include hla-c related epitopes beyond the common hla-a0201 and hla-b4001 approach to estimate the ability of antigen presentation scores to identify 2019-ncov t-cell epitopes we performed a validation study with known sars-cov cd8 and cd4 t-cell epitopes fig 3  the copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer-reviewed is the  figure 3  validation of netmhcpan and maria for t-cell epitope identification with sars-cov s protein

95th presentation percentile cut-off and an overall auc of 083 independent experimental studies 22 23 24 25  we identified known cd8 t-cell epitopes mhc-i n17 and known cd4 t-cell epitopes mhc-ii n3 we also obtained known non-epitopes n1236 and 246 for cd4 while for cd8 we include all 9mer sliding windows of s protein without a known epitope as non-epitopes mhc-i presentation with recommended cut-off 98 17  has a sensitivity of 823 specificity of 970 and an auc of 098 fig 3a  mhc-ii presentation recommended cut-off 95 15  has a sensitivity of 666 specificity of 911 and an auc of 083 fig 3b  given the high similarity between sars-cov and 2019-ncov proteins we expect our analysis on 2019-ncov to perform similarly against future experimentally validated t-cell epitopes the detailed scores and sequences of this analysis can be found in supplementary table 7 and 8 human immune selection pressure has been shown to drive viral mutations which evade immune surveillance eg low mhc presentation we hypothesize that a similar phenomenon can occur in 2019-ncov we curated a cohort of 68 viral genomes across four continents and identified 93 point mutations 2 nonsense mutation and 1 deletion mutation compared to the published reference genome 5  we plot point mutations against regions of mhc-i or mhc-ii presentation in fig 4  the full protein sequence and mutation information can be found in supplementary table 9  10 mutations occur in most genes with the exception of e orf6 orf7b and n we identify a recurrent mutation l84s in orf8 in 20 samples mutations are more likely to occur in regions with mhc-i presentation fischers exact test p  002 no relationship was observed with mhc-ii p  058 or an aggregate of mhc-i and mhc-ii p  014 this is consistent with the role of cd8 t-cell in clearing infected cells and mutations supporting the evasion of immune surveillance 37  be presented by multiple mhc alleles as indicated in our heatmap fig 4  in a sample from japan epiisl407084 the viral gene orf1ab loses nucleotides 94-118 which code for gdsveevl an associated antigen fgdsveevl is predicted to be good presented by multiple mhc-i alleles eg 999 for hla-c0801 992 for hla-c0102 and 990 for hla-b3901 in summary we observed that 2019-ncov mutations often occur among or delete presentable peptides a potential form of immune evasion patient mhc allele information and t-cell profiling are needed to better assess this phenomenon however patients typically carry fewer than 3 mutations so a vaccine against multiple epitopes will not be nullified by such a small number of mutations we obtained the likely 3d structure of 2019-ncovs spike protein supplementary file 1 by homology modeling with sars-covs spike protein pdb 6acc we scanned both spike protein structures with discotope2 to identify potential antibody binding sites on the protein surface fig 5  for the sars-cov s protein we identified a strong cluster of antibody sites 30 residues pink or red on the receptor binding domain rbd the ace2 interacting surface three independent studies 32 30 31  discovered b-cell epitopes in this region blue with a combination of in vitro and ex vivo approaches additionally discotope2 identifies residue 541-555 as another binding site which was supported by two independent studies fig 5a blue 30 31  this gives us some confidence in the ability of discotope2 to predict b-cell epitopes if given a unknown protein structure for the 2019-ncov s protein discotope2 identified a similar antibody binding site on s protein potential rbd but with fewer residues 17 residues fig 5b  with computational protein-protein docking we predicted one potential interacting conformation between the 2019-ncov s protein and the human ace2 entry receptor fig 5c  the main antibody binding site substantially overlaps with the interacting surface where ace2 binds to s protein and an antibody binding to this surface is likely to block viral entry into cells discotope2 identified anther antibody binding site residue 246-257 different from sars-cov but with lower scores -25 raw scores 3d structures of both spike protein were scanned with discotope2 to assess potential antibody binding sites b-cell epitopes red indicates residues with score  05 cut-off for specificity of 90 and pink indicates residues with score  -25 cut-off for specificity of 80 a the receptor binding domain rbd of sars spike protein has concentrated high score residues and is comprised of two linear epitopes one additional binding site is predicted to be around residue 541-555 three independent experimental studies 32 30 31 identify patient antibodies recognize these three linear epitopes blue b 2019-ncov spike protein is predicted to have a similar strong antibody binding site near rbd and an additional site around residue 246-257 c the predicted antibody binding site on 2019-ncov rbd potentially overlaps with the interacting surface for the known human entry receptor ace2 yellow d eight 2019-ncov spike protein point mutations are present in a cohort of 68 viral samples no mutations are near the ace2 interacting surface one mutation s247r occurs near one of the predicted antibody binding sites residue 246-257 table 2  top potential epitopes for key 2019-ncov proteins we ranked epitopes based on their likely coverage of presentation by mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles s protein 494-508 is highly ranked based on mhc presentation and is also one of the predicted top b-cell epitopes localized near the s protein receptor binding domain  figure 5  mhc-i coverage is calculated by the 9mer with the highest mhc-i coverage for each epitope highlighted in orange all candidates are likely to be presented by both mhc-i and mhc-ii a question mark  under the antibody column indicates that one or more sars homolog of this peptide is a known b-cell epitope we identified 8 point mutation sites on s protein from a cohort of 68 2019-ncov samples fig 5d  all mutations are apart from the protein s rbd and one mutation s247r occurs near one of the predicted minor antibody binding site residue 246-257 in summary we observed major structural and b-cell epitope similarity between sars-cov and 2019-ncov spike proteins a recent cryo-em study of 2019-ncov s protein 18 supports such structural similarity and it would be informative to rerun our analysis once the cryo-em crystal structure becomes publicly available rbds in both proteins seem to be important b-cell epitopes for neutralizing antibodies however sars-cov appears to have larger attack surface than 2019-ncov fig 5a 5b  fortunately we have not observed any mutations altering binding sites for this major b-cell epitope in 2019-ncov after understanding the landscape of t-cell and b-cell epitopes of 2019-ncov we summarize our results in table 2 for promising candidates for 2019-ncov vaccines ideal antigens should be presented by multiple mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles in a general population and contain linear b-cell epitopes associated with neutralizing antibodies specifically we first identified regions with high coverage of mhc-ii then ranked them based on their mhc-i coverage we further search these top candidates with 90 sequence similarity on iedb 38 to assess whether any candidate has been previously reported for being a b-cell epitope or t-cell epitope around 1000 peptide 15mers can be presented by a wide range of mhc-ii 33 which is consistent with our knowledge about promiscuity of mhc-ii presentation 15 39  when further requiring a peptide to be presented by more than 33 or 66 of common mhc-i alleles we narrowed the results to 405 or 44 promising t-cell epitopes respectively supplementary table 5  6 the top 13 candidates in key viral proteins can be presented by 52-83 of mhc-i alleles  table 2  most notably s protein 494-508 is not only a good mhc presenter but also a predicted b-cell epitope near the s protein receptor binding domain fig 5b  which indicates a good vaccine candidate in summary we analyzed the 2019-ncov viral genome for epitope candidates and found 405 likely t-cell epitopes with strong mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation scores and 2 potential neutralizing b-cell epitopes on s protein we validated our methodology by running a similar analysis on sars-cov against known sars t-cell and b-cell epitopes inspecting 68 samples we found that viral mutations have a tendency to occur in regions with strong mhc-i presentation which can be a form of immune evasion however no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain which is critical for viral entrance to cells and neutralizing antibody binding similar to sars-cov 1 8  the 2019-ncov spike protein is likely to be immunogenic as it carries a number of both t-cell and b-cell epitopes recombinant surface protein vaccines have demonstrated strong clinical utilities in hepatitis b and human papillomavirus hpv vaccines 11 45  a recombinant 2019-ncov spike protein vaccine combined with other top epitopes and an appropriate adjuvant could be a reasonable next step for 2019-ncov vaccine development from an economic perspective the development of coronavirus vaccines faces significant financial hurdles as most such viruses do not cause endemic infections after an epidemic episode eg sars there is little financial incentive for private companies to develop vaccines against a specific strain of virus 10 2 8  to address these incentive issues governments might provide greater funding support to create vaccines against past and future outbreaks our pipeline provides a framework to identify strong epitope-based vaccine candidates-beyond 2019-ncov-and might be applied against any unknown pathogens previous animal studies do show antigens with high mhc presentation scores are more likely to elicit strong t-cell responses but the correlation between vaccine efficacy and t-cell responses is relatively weak 14 46 7  when combined with future clinical data our work can help the field untangle the relationship between antigen presentation scores and vaccine efficacy supplementary   research and development on therapeutic agents and vaccines

covid-19 caused by the new coronavirus 2019-ncov that is now officially
designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus
sars-cov-2 represents a pandemic threat to global public health12 although the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak in december of 2019
was located in wuhan china this disease has spread to more than
100 countries figure 1 with over 100 000 confirmed cases and over 3800 confirmed
deaths worldwide figure 2 as of march 9 20203 in addition
millions of peoples lives have been affected as a result of
mandatory isolationsquarantines the ripple effect of the covid-19
outbreak could potentially bring major challenges to worldwide health
systems and have far-reaching consequences on the global economy if
the spread of the virus is not effectively controlled124 coronaviruses covs are relatively large viruses containing a single-stranded
positive-sense rna genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope
the viral membrane is studded with glycoprotein spikes that give coronaviruses
their crown-like appearance figure 3 while coronaviruses infect both humans and animals
certain types of animals such as bats that host the largest variety
of coronaviruses appear to be immune to coronavirus-induced illness5 there are four classes of coronaviruses designated
as alpha beta gamma and delta the betacoronavirus class includes
severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus sars-cov middle
east respiratory syndrome mers virus mers-cov and the covid-19
causative agent sars-cov-2 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2
attacks the lower respiratory system to cause viral pneumonia but
it may also affect the gastrointestinal system heart kidney liver
and central nervous system leading to multiple organ failure67 current information indicates that sars-cov-2 is more transmissiblecontagious
than sars-cov8 the betacoronavirus genome encodes
several structural proteins including the glycosylated spike s
protein that functions as a major inducer of host immune responses
this s protein mediates host cell invasion by both sars-cov and sars-cov-2
via binding to a receptor protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 ace2 located on the surface membrane of host cells911 a recent study also revealed that this invasion process requires s
protein priming which is facilitated by the host cell-produced serine
protease tmprss211 in addition the viral genome also encodes several
nonstructural proteins including rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp
coronavirus main protease 3clpro and papain-like protease plpro1213 upon entrance to the host cells the viral genome is released as
a single-stranded positive rna subsequently it is translated into
viral polyproteins using host cell protein translation machinery
which are then cleaved into effector proteins by viral proteinases
3clpro and plpro1213 plpro also behaves as a deubiquitinase
that may deubiquinate certain host cell proteins including interferon
factor 3 and nf-b resulting in immune suppression1314 rdrp synthesizes a full-length negative-strand rna template to be
used by rdrp to make more viral genomic rna the interaction
between viral s protein and ace2 on the host cell surface is of significant
interest since it initiates the infection process cryo-em structure
analysis has revealed that the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 s protein
to ace2 is about 1020 times higher than that of sars-cov s
protein1015 it is speculated that this may contribute
to the reported higher transmissibility and contagiousness of sars-cov-2
as compared to sars-cov8 the prospect
also exists for discovery of therapeutic agents targeting the highly
conserved proteins associated with both sars-cov and sars-cov-21518 rdrp and 3clpro protease of sars-cov-2 share over 95 of sequence
similarity with those of sars-cov despite the fact that these two
viruses demonstrate only 79 sequence similarity at the genome level1518 on the basis of sequence alignment and homology modeling sars-cov
and sars-cov-2 share a highly conserved receptor-binding domain rbd
a domain of s protein and 76 of sequence similarity in their s proteins1518 in addition although the plpro sequences of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov
are only 83 similar they share similar active sites16 to date there are no sars-cov-2-specific
antiviral agents researchers have been racing to find possible treatments
to save lives and produce vaccines for future prevention to support
research and development efforts to discover effective therapeutic
and preventive agents for covid-19 cas a division of the american
chemical society specializing in scientific information solutions
has analyzed scientific data related to the development of therapeutic
agents and vaccines for human coronaviruses since 2003 the analyses
presented in this report are based on the cas content collection
a scientist-curated data collection covering published scientific
literature and patents from over 60 patent authorities worldwide
for a subset of the analyses both cas and medline data were collectively
analyzed since the outbreak of covid-19 this new disease and its causative
virus have drawn major global attention scientists and physicians
worldwide have been conducting a major campaign to understand this
new emergent disease and its epidemiology in an effort to uncover
possible treatment regimens discover effective therapeutic agents
and develop vaccines figure 4 shows the total number of journal articles related to covid-19
or sars-cov-2 published each week from the last week of 2019 through
the week of february 24 2020 over 500 journal articles were published
electronically or in print during this period and the number of published
articles has increased each week since the week of january 13 2020
although a large portion of these articles are about clinical manifestations
and treatment options an increasing number of studies are focused
on elucidation of virus structure virus transmission mechanismsdynamics
as well as identification of antiviral agents and accurate diagnostics
for virus detection these trends reflect immense interest and desire
from the scientific community including both academic and industrial
organizations as well as clinicians to identify new methods to halt
the progression of this epidemic disease and to prevent infection
and transmission in the future table 1 lists some
journal articles published from december 30 2019 through february 23
2020 these articles were selected based on collective use of factors
such as journal impact factor citation and type of study for example
the no 8 article listed about the characterization of the sars-cov-2
genome has greatly facilitated the global effort to develop a vaccine
for prevention of covid-19 also shown in this table are journal articles
pertaining to potential antiviral drug candidates such as remdesivir baricitinib and chloroquine for the treatment of this disease as mentioned earlier
covid-19 is caused by sars-cov-2 a new type of coronavirus in the
same genus as sars-cov and mers-cov viral proteins responsible for
sars-cov-2 entry into host cells and replication are structurally
similar to those associated with sars-cov thus research and development
on sars and mers may offer insights that would be beneficial to the
development of therapeutic and preventive agents for covid-19 this
report identified pertinent data from patents related to these two
coronaviruses figure 5 shows the distribution of patents in the cas content collection
related to sars a and mers b the number of patents related to
sars is almost 12 times the number related to mers probably because
the sars outbreak occurred about 10 years before the mers outbreak
among sars patents about 80 are related to the development of therapeutics
35 are related to vaccines and 28 are related to diagnostic agents
or methods because an individual patent may cover any two or more
areas the sum of percentage values is greater than 100 a similar
distribution pattern was also observed for patents related to mers
thus for both diseases more patents have been devoted to the development
of therapeutic agents as opposed to diagnostic methods and vaccines identification of targets
is important for identifying drugs with high target specificity andor
uncovering existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat sars-cov-2
infection table 2 lists
potential targets their roles in viral infection and representative
existing drugs or drug candidates that reportedly act on the corresponding
targets in similar viruses and thus are to be assessed for their effects
on sars-cov-2 infection 3clpro and plpro are two viral proteases
responsible for the cleavage of viral peptides into functional units
for virus replication and packaging within the host cells thus drugs
that target these proteases in other viruses such as hiv drugs lopinavir
and ritonavir have been explored19 rdrp
is the rna polymerase responsible for viral rna synthesis that may
be blocked by existing antiviral drugs or drug candidates such as
remdesivir19 conceivably the interaction
of viral s protein with its receptor ace2 on host cells and subsequent
viral endocytosis into the cells may also be a viable drug target
for example the broad-spectrum antiviral drug arbidol which functions
as a virus-host cell fusion inhibitor to prevent viral entry into
host cells against influenza virus20 has
entered into a clinical trial for treatment of sars-cov-22122 the protease tmprss2 produced by the host cells plays an important
role in proteolytic processing of s protein priming to the receptor
ace2 binding in human cells11 it has been
shown that camostat mesylate a clinically approved tmprss2 inhibitor
was able to block sars-cov-2 entry to human cells indicating its
potential as a drug for covid-1911 ace2 involvement with coronavirus infection is of further interest
since ace2 is a potent negative regulator restraining overactivation
of the renin-angiotensin system ras that may be involved in elicitation
of inflammatory lung disease in addition to its well-known role in
regulation of blood pressure and balance of body fluid and electrolytes2324 it catalyzes degradation of angiotensin ii to angiotensin 17
the balance between angiotensin ii and angiotensin 17 is
critical since angiotensin ii binds to angiotensin at1 receptor to
cause vasoconstriction whereas angiotensin 17 elicits vasodilation
mediated by at22527 although the notion that ace2 mediates coronavirus
invasion is largely accepted it remains unclear how the levels or
activities of ace2 at1 receptors and at2 receptors are altered in
coronavirus-induced diseases due to the limited number of studies2324 therefore it is yet to be determined whether some drugs or compounds
that target any of these proteins eg l-163491 as a partial antagonist
of at1 receptor and partial agonist of at2 receptor may alleviate
coronavirus-induced lung injury28 the cas content
collection contains patents related to coronavirus key proteins listed
above table 3 lists
the number of patents related to each protein target and associated
therapeutic compounds with a cas registry number cas rn reported
in these patents cas data show that targets 3clpro and rdrp attracted
more attention than other targets and more compounds with therapeutic
potential were identified for these targets probably due to the work
done for sars-cov which also contains 3clpro and rdrp since sars-cov-2 is
a newly discovered pathogen no specific drugs have been identified
or are currently available an economic and efficient therapeutic
strategy is to repurpose existing drugs on the basis of genomic sequence
information coupled with protein structure modeling the scientific
community has been able to rapidly respond with a suggested list of
existing drugs with therapeutic potential for covid-19 table 4 provides a summary of such
drugs together with potential mechanisms of actions for their activities
barcitinib was proposed because of its anti-inflammatory effect and
possible ability to reduce viral entry35 a fixed dose of the anti-hiv combination lopinavirritonavir
is currently in clinical trials with arbidol or ribavirin22 remdesivir developed by gilead sciences inc
was previously tested in humans with ebola virus disease and has shown
promise in animal models for mers and sars the drug is currently being studied in phase iii clinical trials
in both china and the usa favipiravir a purine nucleoside
leading to inaccurate viral rna synthesis36 was originally developed by toyama chemical of japan and has recently
been approved for a clinical trial as a drug to treat covid-1930 chloroquine an antimalarial drug has proven
effective in treating coronavirus in china32 in addition to the above-mentioned many other antiviral drugs are
also listed table 5 shows selected patents associated
with the aforementioned potential drugs together with patents disclosing
small molecules for treatment of sars or mers the selection was based
on the presence of important terms in cas-indexed patents as well
as the presence of the synthetic preparation role assigned by cas
scientists during document indexing patent applications wo2009114512
and wo2014028756 disclose preparation of compounds active as jak inhibitors

developed to inhibit viral 3c protease or 3c-like protease ie
3clpro patent application wo2018042343 presents both preparation
methods and biological assay results for compounds capable of inhibiting
the sars virus proteases these compounds appeared to exhibit good
enzyme-inhibiting activity pic50  7 or ic50  01 m and antiviral activity which was
assessed by host cell viability using cultured human lung fibroblast
mrc-5 cells infected with a specified virus eg mers virus expressing
the viral s protein drug administration routes were also mentioned
in this patent besides various commercialized
antiviral drugs there are also small molecule compounds currently
in research and development that have shown significant inhibitory
effects on many key proteins from similar coronaviruses such as sars-cov
and mers-cov table 6 these drug candidates mostly inhibit viral enzymes including proteases
and components for rdrp since 3clpro protease has a high level of
sequence homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 inhibitors against
3clpro of sars-cov may also be applicable to sars-cov-2 compounds
including benzopurpurin b c-467929 c-473872 nsc-306711 and n-65828
which may inhibit the activity of viral nsp15 polyu-specific endoribonuclease
were tested for reduced sars-cov infectivity in cultured cells with
ic50 of 0240 m38 compound c-21 and cgp-42112a are two at2 agonists whereas l-163491
has dual functions as a partial agonist for at2 receptor and a partial
antagonist of at1 receptor since at1 and at2 are important effectors
in the ras system to which ace2 belongs it has been speculated that
these compounds may be used to adjust the balance between at1 and
at2 which may be affected by coronavirus infection and to alleviate
viral-induced lung injury during the infection24 besides the aforementioned antiviral drugs there may
be additional small molecule compounds with therapeutic or pharmacological
potential against viruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov compounds

usage role compound name and cas rn are provided for each compound
the second column lists the number of compounds that met the structure
similarity and lipinskis rule criteria although more work
remains to be done in this regard the methodology and results mentioned
here point to a strategy that may help streamline the process of drug
discovery for covid-19 the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 related to
sars and mers viruses is causing serious and ongoing epidemiological
problems around the world since there is limited clinical and basic
research information at this time treatment options for covid-19
currently comprise investigational drugs and management of symptoms
as biologics have the potential to broaden the spectrum of the treatment
options for coronavirus-induced diseases leveraging prior knowledge
and practices used to address the sars and mers outbreaks provides
a practical strategy for developing new target-specific therapeutic
agents for sars-cov-2 to this end an analysis of biologics from
patents contained in the cas content collection was performed the
patent analysis included information related to therapeutic antibodies
cytokines interfering and other therapeutic rnas and vaccines for
potential treatment andor prevention of sars-related diseases from
patents published from 2003 to the present figure 6 shows more than 500 patents that disclose
the use of these four biologics classes to treat and prevent sars
and mers of these patents vaccine development was the largest class
363 followed by therapeutic antibodies 99 interfering rnas 35
and cytokines 22 given the indispensable role of vaccines in viral
disease prevention detailed analysis of vaccines will be presented
in a later section ninety-nine

diagnostic potential for sars and mers were identified of these
61 patents claimed preparation of sars-specific antibodies 23 mers-specific

elicits an immune response43table 8 shows the target
analysis of patents related to development of therapeutic antibodies
for sars over 90 of these antibodies are directed against s protein

research and development of coronavirus-related therapeutic agents
and preventive vaccines based on the extensive cas content collection
with a focus on patents it includes an overview of coronavirus morphology
biology and pathogenesis with a particular focus on antiviral strategies
involving small molecule drugs as well as biologics targeting complex
molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication
the drug-repurposing effort summarized in this report is focused primarily
on agents currently known to be effective against other rna viruses
including sars-cov mers-cov influenza hcv and ebola as well as
anti-inflammatory drugs the potential impact of biologics for treatment
of coronavirus infections is promising and includes a wide variety
of options including bioengineered and vectored antibodies cytokines
and nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression as
well as various types of vaccines the information provided
in this report provides a strong intellectual groundwork for support
of ongoing research and development for discovery and development
of therapeutic agents and vaccines for treatment of covid-19 and coronavirus-related
diseases because of limited space this report devotes minimal attention
to current efforts involved in advancing more efficient and accurate
covid-19 diagnosis methods and products novel infectious diseases
resulting from rna viruses subject to mutation and genetic recombination
as well as cross-species transmission will continue to present a
serious global health threat as exemplified by covid-19 despite
two former major outbreaks of coronavirus infections causing the sars
and mers respiratory illnesses the world remains underprepared to
effectively manage the current covid-19 outbreak as evidenced by
the fact that covid-19 has resulted in thousands of deaths worldwide a concerted effort to develop effective drugs and vaccines against
existing and potential future coronavirus infections and other highly
pathogenic virus outbreaks is necessary to reduce overwhelming impacts
on human life and worldwide healthcare systems given the costly and
arduous process involved with clinical drug development the outbreak
of covid-19 further highlights the value of developing relatively
broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and the importance of applying innovative
approaches such as artificial intelligence to facilitate drug discovery
given the lengthy process of new drug development the current strategy
of drug repurposing has become one of the chosen solutions for immediate
treatment of sars-cov-2 infected individuals long-term drug development
goals for the pharmaceutical industry include identification of inhibitors
aimed at the replication or infection processes associated with sars-cov-2
or other related coronaviruses as well as the symptomatic results
of their infections leading to severe disease andor death the summarized
lists contained in this report of small molecule compounds and
additional descriptions of biologics with properties suitable for
inhibiting several key coronavirus proteins could serve as information
starting points for drug development since vaccines are crucial for
prevention of coronavirus-related epidemic diseases in the future
it is reassuring that a number of innovative strategies are already
being deployed four mers coronavirus dna vaccine candidates began
phase 1 clinical trials in september of 201956 and moderna inc released its first batch of mrna-1273 in february
of 2020 which is an mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 ready for phase
1 study in the united states55 additional
collaboration in the areas of antiviral discovery processes and clinical
trial performance will enhance patients access to drug candidates
with improved therapeutic potential and ideally reduce the amount
of time required to bring these drugs to market the abundance of publications and the
rapid publication rate associated with the sars-cov-2 virus-related
disease outbreak as illustrated in this report are indicative
of the intense effort by research institutes and pharmaceutical
industries to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes
useful for treating current and future coronavirus outbreaks  immunoinformatic identification of b cell and t cell epitopes in the sars-cov-2 proteome 1 stephen crooke n inna ovsyannikova g richard kennedy b gregory poland a  a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 emerged from china in late 2019 and rapidly spread across 29 the globe infecting millions of people and generating societal disruption on a level not seen since the 30 1918 influenza pandemic a safe and effective vaccine is desperately needed to prevent the continued 31 spread of sars-cov-2 yet rational vaccine design efforts are currently hampered by the lack of 32 knowledge regarding viral epitopes targeted during an immune response and the need for more in-depth 33 knowledge on betacoronavirus immunology to that end we developed a computational workflow using 34 a series of open-source algorithms and webtools to analyze the proteome of sars-cov-2 and identify 35 putative t cell and b cell epitopes using increasingly stringent selection criteria to select peptides with 36 significant hla promiscuity and predicted antigenicity we identified 41 potential t cell epitopes 5 hla 37 class i 36 hla class ii and 6 potential b cell epitopes respectively docking analysis and binding 38 predictions demonstrated enrichment for peptide binding to hla-b class i and hla-drb1 class ii 39 molecules overlays of predicted b cell epitopes with the structure of the viral spike s glycoprotein 40 revealed that 4 of 6 epitopes were located in the receptor-binding domain of the s protein to our 41 knowledge this is the first study to comprehensively analyze all 10 structural non-structural and 42 accessory proteins from sars-cov-2 using predictive algorithms to identify potential targets for 43 vaccine development 44 the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 recently emerged from china rapidly spreading and ushering in a 48 global pandemic despite intensive research efforts our knowledge of sars-cov-2 immunology and the 49 proteins targeted by the immune response remains relatively limited making it difficult to rationally 50 design candidate vaccines we employed a suite of bioinformatic tools computational algorithms and 51 structural modeling to comprehensively analyze the entire sars-cov-2 proteome for potential t cell and 52 b cell epitopes utilizing a set of stringent selection criteria to filter peptide epitopes we identified 41 t 53 cell epitopes 5 hla class i 36 hla class ii and 6 b cell epitopes that could serve as promising targets 54 for peptide-based vaccine development against this emerging global pathogen 55 56 57  in december 2019 public health officials in wuhan china reported the first case of severe 60 respiratory disease attributed to infection with the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 1 since its 61 emergence sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly via human-to-human transmission 2 threatening to 62 overwhelm healthcare systems around the world and resulting in the declaration of a pandemic by the 63 world health organization 3 the disease caused by the virus is characterized by fever 64 pneumonia and other respiratory and inflammatory symptoms that can result in severe inflammation of 65 lung tissue and ultimately death-particularly among older adults or individuals with underlying 66 comorbidities 4-6 as of this writing the sars-cov-2 pandemic has resulted in 4 million confirmed 67 cases of covid-19 and over 280000 deaths worldwide 7 68 sars-cov-2 is the third pathogenic coronavirus to cross the species barrier into humans in the 69 past two decades preceded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 8 9 and 70 middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 10 all three of these viruses belong to the 71  -coronavirus genus and have either been confirmed sars-cov or suggested mers-cov sars-72 cov-2 to originate in bats with transmission to humans occurring through intermediary animal hosts 73 11 12 13 14  while previous zoonotic spillovers of coronaviruses have been marked by high case fatality rates 74 10 for sars-cov 34 for mers-cov widespread transmission of disease has been relatively 75 limited 8098 cases of sars 2494 cases of mers 15 in contrast sars-cov-2 is estimated to have 76 a lower case fatality rate 2-4 but is far more infectious and has achieved world-wide spread in a 77 matter of months 16 78 as the number of covid-19 cases continues to grow there is an urgent need for a safe and 79 effective vaccine to combat the spread of sars-cov-2 and reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare 80 systems no licensed vaccine or therapeutic is currently available for sars-cov-2 although there are 81 over 100 vaccine candidates reportedly in development worldwide seven vaccine candidates have 82 peptide was removed from the structure using chimera 114 university of california-san francisco 50 158 prior to running simulations ten models of each peptide-hla complex were generated on the basis of 159 minimized energy scores and the top model for each complex was selected for comparative analysis 160 prediction and structural modeling of sars-cov-2 b cell epitopes 161 linear b cell epitope predictions were performed on the three exposed sars-cov-2 structural 162 proteins s genbank accession qhd43416 m qhd43419 and e qhd43418 using the bepipred 163 10 algorithm 51 epitope probability scores were calculated for each amino acid residue using a 164 threshold of 035 corresponding to  075 specificity and sensitivity below 05 and only epitopes  5 165 amino acid residues in length were further analyzed the structure of the sars-cov-2 s protein was 166 accessed from the protein data bank pdb id 6vsb 52 discontinuous ie structural b cell epitope 167 predictions for the s protein structure were carried out using discotope 11 53 with a score threshold 168 greater than -77 corresponding to  075 specificity and sensitivity below 05 the main protein 169 structure was modeled in pymol schrdinger llc with predicted b cell epitopes identified by both 170 bepipred 10 and discotope 11 highlighted as spheres 171 genetic similarity of sars-cov-2 isolates 173 the primary goal of our study was to identify peptide epitopes that would be broadly applicable 174 in vaccine development efforts against sars-cov-2 we identified 64 point mutations and 4 deletions 175 across the genomes of 44 clinical isolates with all deletions and the majority of mutations n45 176 occurring in the orf1ab polyprotein supp figure s1  single-point mutations were also found in the s 177 protein n5 n protein n5 orf8 protein n3 orf3a protein n2 orf10 protein n2 e 178 protein n1 and m protein n1 despite the genetic diversity introduced by these events figure 1d  179 matrix analysis determined that  99 sequence identity was maintained across all viral genomes based 180 on these findings and for study feasibility the genome from the original virus isolate 181 genbank mn908947 was selected as the consensus sequence for all further analyses 182 we next identified potential cd8  t cell epitopes from all proteins in the sars-cov-2 184 proteome using the netctl 12 predictive algorithm we analyzed the complete amino acid sequence of 185 each viral protein to generate sets of 9-mer peptides predicted to be recognized across at least one of the 186 major hla class i supertypes figure 2a supp figure s2  this approach yielded a significant number 187 of potential epitopes from each viral protein orf10 9 orf6 17 orf8 23 e 25 orf7 39 n 80 188 m 87 orf3a 87 s 321 orf1ab 2814  with the number directly related to the size of the parent protein we used the netmhcpan 40 server to further refine the list of potential cd8  t cell epitopes by 190 predicting binding affinity across representative hla class i alleles see methods and assigning 191 percentile scores to quantify binding propensity peptides with percentile rank scores  05 ie strong 192 binders were filtered using a 500 nm threshold for binding affinity to further delineate 740 candidate 193 hla class i epitopes from the viral proteome 54 for feasibility reasons we refined our selection to 83 194 candidate epitopes by excluding peptides predicted to bind only one hla molecule supp  table s1  195 the resultant peptides were enriched for predicted binders to hla-b molecules 196 hla-b580132 hla-b080131  figure 2b  a final round of selection on the basis of hla 197 promiscuity ie predicted binding to  3 hla molecules and predicted antigenicity scoring using the 198 vaxijen 20 server produced a subset of five candidate peptides four orf1ab one s protein as potential 199 targets for vaccine development table 1 with the hypothesis that increased hla binding promiscuity 200 meant broader population base coverage by those peptides these peptides were predicted to provide 74 201 global population coverage and had higher predicted binding affinities for hla-b molecules 202 b0801426 nm b1501677 nm b58011103 nm compared to hla-a molecules 203 a01012386 nm a24021429 nm with the exception of one orf1ab-derived peptide 204 mmisagfsl that was predicted to bind hla-a0201 with high affinity ic 50  69 nm  figure 2c  205 we also sought to identify potential hla class ii peptides from sars-cov-2 as the stimulation 207 of cd4  t-helper cells is critical for robust vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses using the 208 netmhciipan 32 server we identified 801 candidate hla class ii peptides from the viral proteome 209 predicted to have high binding affinity  500 nm and percentile rank scores  2 across a reference 210 panel of hla molecules covering  97 of the population 33 45 similar to hla class i epitope 211 predictions the number of class ii epitopes identified for each viral protein orf10 4 e protein 7 212 orf7 8 orf8 10 orf6 14 n 15 m 29 orf3a 31 s 96 orf1ab 587 was largely proportional 213 to protein size after excluding peptides predicted to bind to only a single hla molecule in our panel we 214 refined our selection to 211 peptides supp  table s2  which were enriched for binding to hla-drb1 215 molecules n142  figure 2d  filtering on hla promiscuity and predicted antigenicity scores yielded 216 a subset of 36 peptides 24 orf1ab 5 s protein 2 m protein 2 orf7 1 orf3a 1 orf6 1 orf8 as 217 cd4  t cell epitopes for further study  table 1  these peptides were predicted to collectively provide 218 99 population coverage and have significantly higher average binding affinities for hla-dr alleles 219 drb1564 nm drb3509 nm drb4701 nm drb518 nm compared to hla-dp 1559 nm 220 or hla-dq 2386 nm molecules  figure 2e  221 characterization of hla class i peptide docking with hla-b1501 the five candidate hla class i peptides identified by our computational approach were predicted 223 to provide coverage across six hla alleles a0101 a0201 a2402 b0801 b1501 b5801 224 the peptide famqmayrf was the only candidate predicted to bind to a2402 molecules whereas 225 mmisagfsl was predicted to uniquely bind a0201 and b0801 molecules four of the five peptides 226 were predicted to bind a0101 and b5801 molecules but all were predicted to bind with relatively 227 high affinity average ic 50  677 nm to hla-b1501 therefore we performed molecular docking 228 studies of each peptide with the molecular structure of hla-b1501 pdb 3c9n 229 all peptides were predicted to bind within the peptide binding groove forming hydrogen bond 230 contacts with numerous amino acid side chains  figure 3a  the binding motif for hla-b1501 is 231 highly selective for residues at the p2 and p9 anchor positions with a preference for bulky hydrophobic 232 amino acids at the c-terminus  figure 3b  55 all candidate peptides possessed terminal residues phe 233 tyr leu that fit into the hydrophobic binding pocket of the hla groove further supporting that these 234 peptides should be strong binders of hla-b1501 and promising candidates for vaccine development 235 studies 236 an effective vaccine should stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses against the 238 target pathogen therefore we also sought to identify potential b cell epitopes from sars-cov-2 239 proteins we limited our analysis to the primary structural proteins exposed on the virus capsid s n m 240 and e as these are the most accessible antigens for engaging b cell receptors using the bepipred 10 241 algorithm we identified 26 potential linear b cell epitopes in the s protein 14 potential epitopes in the n 242 protein and 3 potential epitopes in the m protein  table 2  no epitopes were identified in the e protein 243 studies have previously shown the s protein to be the predominant target of neutralizing antibodies 244 against coronaviruses 56 57 and as our findings indicate this to likely be the case for sars-cov-2 245 we focused all subsequent analyses on the s protein while the n protein is also a major target of the 246 antibody response 58 it is unlikely these antibodies have any neutralizing activity based on the viral 247 structure as epitope conformation can significantly influence recognition by antibodies we also 248 employed discotope 11 to identify discontinuous b cell epitopes in the protein structure our analysis 249 identified 14 potential structural epitopes in the s protein 7 in the s1 domain 7 in the s2 domain with 250 six regions having significant overlap with our predicted linear epitopes  table 2  antigenic regions 251 identified in both analyses were modeled using the recently published structure of the sars-cov-2 s 252 protein 52 to examine their accessibility for antibody binding epitopes in the s2 domain p792-d796 253 y1138-d1146 were clustered near the base of the spike protein whereas regions in the s1 domain 254 d405-d428 n440-n450 g496-p507 d568-t573 were exposed on the protein surface figure 4  in the face of the covid-19 pandemic it is imperative that safe and effective vaccines be rapidly 257 developed in order to induce widespread herd immunity in the population and prevent the continued 258 spread of sars-cov-2 our study identified probable peptide targets of both cellular and humoral 259 immune responses against sars-cov-2 using computational methodologies to investigate the entire viral 260 proteome a priori studies such as these are paramount during the early stages of pandemic vaccine 261 development given the relative scarcity of biological data available on the viral immune response and we 262 employed an approach that allowed us to systematically refine our predictions using increasingly stringent 263 criteria to select a subset of the most promising epitopes for further study the data we have curated could 264 inform the design of a candidate peptide-based vaccine or diagnostic against sars-cov-2 265 as selective pressures are known to introduce viral mutations that promote fitness and can lead 266 to evasion of immune responses 59 60 we first sought to investigate the genetic similarity of all 267 reported sars-cov-2 clinical isolates and identify a consensus sequence for use in our epitope 268 prediction studies we identified 68 mutationsdeletions across the 44 genomes of clinical isolates 269 reported as of 27 february 2020 despite these variations the viral genomic identity was  99 270 conserved across all isolates as the protein coding sequences were largely conserved the genome of the 271 original virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 was deemed a representative consensus sequence for analysis of the 272 sars-cov-2 proteome 273 cd4  and cd8  t cell responses will likely be directed against both structural and non-structural 274 proteins during antiviral immune responses as all viral proteins are accessible for processing and 275 presentation on the hla molecules of infected cells therefore we sought to identify t cell epitopes 276 across the entire viral proteome our analysis identified 83 potential cd8  t cell epitopes supp table  277 s1 and 211 potential cd4  t cell epitopes supp  table s2  with stringent filtering for more 278 promiscuous peptides with high predicted antigenicity yielding a subset of 5 cd8  t cell epitopes and 36 279 cd4  t cell epitopes  table 1  as potential targets for vaccine development a single study by grifoni 280 and colleagues has recently reported the computational identification of 241 cd4  t cell epitopes from 281 sars-cov-2 35 and 22 peptides from our analysis shared sequence homology or were nested within 282 peptides identified in their study moreover seven peptides from this initial report were replicated in our 283 final subset of hla class ii epitopes supporting that these peptides may be promising vaccine targets 284 an increasing number of studies have employed predictive algorithms to identify potential hla 285 class i epitopes for sars-cov-2 although relatively few have comprehensively analyzed the entire viral 286 proteome a report from feng et al recently outlined the identification of 499 potential class i epitopes in 287 the main structural proteins from sars-cov-2 but did not consider any non-structural proteins 38 288 grifoni and colleagues conducted a more rigorous analysis identifying 628 unique cd8  t cell epitopes across all sars-cov-2 proteins but focusing their analyses solely on peptides with sequence homology 290 to known sars-cov epitopes 35 our approach initially identified  3500 potential cd8  t cell 291 epitopes across all viral proteins which we refined to a subset of 5 peptides table 1  one peptide 292 derived from orf1ab mmisagfsl was predicted to bind hla-a0201 with high affinity ic 50  69 293 nm  figure 2c  given the prevalence of this allele in the american and european populations 25-60 294 frequency 61 mmisagfsl may represent a promising epitope capable of providing broad vaccine 295 population coverage 296 we also observed a notable enrichment of epitopes predicted to bind hla-b molecules-297 particularly hla-b1501-as we imposed more stringent selection criteria  figure 2b  all five peptides 298 identified by our approach were predicted to be relatively strong binders for this allele ic 50  677 nm 299 with molecular docking simulations illustrating strong contacts with amino acid residues in the peptide 300 binding groove figure 3 a b  a recent computational study identified another hla-b allele b1503 301 as having a high capacity for presenting epitopes from sars-cov-2 that were conserved among other 302 pathogenic coronaviruses 62 these data collectively suggest the hla-b locus may be significantly 303 associated with the immune response to sars-cov-2 and potentially other coronaviruses with further 304 biological studies warranted to determine the true role of host genetics in sars-cov-2 immunology 305 lastly we analyzed the primary structural proteins of sars-cov-2 s n m e proteins for 306 potential b cell epitopes as an ideal vaccine would be designed to stimulate both cellular and humoral 307 immunity our analysis identified potential linear b cell epitopes in all proteins except for the e protein 308  table 2  the greatest number of epitopes were predicted in the surface-exposed s protein n26 but a 309 significant number of epitopes were also predicted for the n protein n14 this is not surprising as 310 previous reports identified the n protein as a significant target of the humoral response to sars-cov 311 63 64 as the s protein is the predominant surface protein and has been the primary target of 312 neutralizing antibody responses against other coronaviruses 56 57 we elected to focus our subsequent 313 analyses solely on antigenic regions in the s protein we identified 14 potential structural epitopes in the 314 s protein structure and referenced against our linear epitope predictions to identify six regions that were 315 independently identified by both analyses table 2 figure 4 to further evaluate the potential of these six antigenic regions as targets for antibody binding we 319 modeled their surface accessibility on the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein 52 four 320 regions in the s1 domain d405-d428 n440-n450 g496-p507 d568-t573 were solvent exposed 321 figure 4 a b  with minimal steric hindrance for antibody accessibility the s1 domain contains the 322 residues n331-v524 important for virus binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 on the cell surface 65 and studies have shown that antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against sars-cov 324 target this domain 66-68 indeed three of the four s1 epitopes identified in our analyses are located in 325 the ace2-binding region supporting their potential utility in vaccine development against sars-cov-2 326 two regions were identified in the s2 stalk domain of the s protein figure 4 a c  while y1138-327 d1146 is located at the base of the s protein and likely inaccessible to antibodies p792-d796 is on the 328 outer face of the protein and has been previously identified as part of a larger b cell epitope that is 329 conserved with sars-cov 35 as sars-cov s2-specific antibodies have previously been shown to 330 possess antiviral activity 66 it is interesting to speculate whether a strategy similar to targeting the 331 influenza hemagglutinin protein stalk could be employed for developing a broadly reactive coronavirus 332 vaccine 333 our study possessed several strengths and limitations rather than restricting our analyses of 334 hla class i and class ii epitopes to specific proteins based on prior studies of sars-cov immunology 335 we investigated the complete proteome of sars-cov-2 using an unbiased approach furthermore we 336 employed a multi-tiered strategy for identifying putative b cell and t cell epitopes from all viral proteins 337 studied our initial analyses were performed with liberal thresholds for epitope identification and at each 338 additional step we imposed more stringent selection criteria to filter these peptides to a subset of b cell 339 and t cell epitopes for further study nevertheless the results of this study are derived purely from 340 computational methods and it should be noted that computational algorithms can fail to capture a 341 significant number of antigenic peptides 69 experimental validation with biological samples will 342 ultimately be needed 343 during the early stages of a pandemic access to sufficient biological samples may be extremely 344 limited so we must continue to utilize methodologies-such as computational predictive algorithms-345 that allow us to explore the epitope landscape for experimental vaccine development our approach in this 346 study allowed us to identify and refine a manageable subset of t cell and b cell epitopes for further 347 testing as components of a sars-cov-2 vaccine based on our results our proposed sars-cov-2 348 vaccine formulation could contain the following 1 one or more b cell peptide epitopes from the s 349 protein to generate protective neutralizing antibodies and 2 multiple hla class i and class ii-derived 350 peptides from other viral proteins to stimulate robust cd8  and cd4  t cell responses based on global 351 allele frequencies these class i and class ii peptides would be expected to collectively provide 74 and 352 99 population coverage respectively while such a vaccine could be readily formulated as a synthetic 353 polypeptide or an adjuvanted peptide mixture these strategies may not retain the epitope structural 354 features necessary to induce a robust antibody response recombinant nanoparticles and assembly into 355 vlps represent promising alternative vaccine platforms as they have been extensively used for the 356 controlled display and delivery of peptide-based vaccine components 70-73 by omitting whole viral 357 proteins from the vaccine formulation a peptide-based sars-cov-2 vaccine should have a well-358 tolerated safety profile and avoid the adverse events previously observed with experimental sars-cov 359 vaccines 19 20 21 22  360 in summary we have identified 41 potential t cell epitopes 5 hla class i 36 hla class ii and 361 6 potential b cell epitopes from across the sars-cov-2 proteome that are predicted to have broad 362 population coverage and could serve as the basis for designing investigational peptide-based vaccines 363 further study on the biological relevance and immunogenicity of these peptides is warranted in an effort 364 to develop a safe and effective vaccine to combat the sars-cov-2 pandemic 365 the authors would like to thank caroline l vitse for editorial assistance

hasanain abdulhameed odhar waheed salam suhad ahjel sami  humadi hasanain odhar abdulhameed  coronavirus disease 2019 is a current pandemic health threat especially for elderly patients with comorbidities this respiratory disease is caused by a beta coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 the disease can progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome that can be fatal currently no specific drug or vaccine are available to combat this pandemic outbreak social distancing and lockdown have been enforced in many places worldwide the spike protein of coronavirus 2 is essential for viral entry into host target cells via interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 this viral protein is considered a potential target for design and development of a drug or vaccine previously we have reported several potential epitopes on coronavirus 2 spike protein with high antigenicity low allergenicity and good stability against specified proteases in the current study we have constructed and evaluated a peptide vaccine from these potential epitopes by using in silico approach this construct is predicted to have a protective immunogenicity low allergenicity and good stability with minor structural flaws in model build the population coverage of the used t-cells epitopes is believed to be high according to the employed restricted alleles the vaccine construct can elicit efficient and long-lasting immune response as appeared through simulation analysis this multiepitope-based peptide vaccine may represent a potential candidate against coronavirus 2 however further in vitro and in vivo verification are required  in december 2019 multiple pneumonia cases of unknown etiology were reported in wuhan china 1 later on genomic analysis of samples collected from admitted patients had revealed that a novel beta-coronavirus was the causative pathogen 2  this rna virus was temporarily known as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov but was renamed later as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3  the disease caused by this virus is known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19  it is usually characterized by fever dry cough fatigue and muscles pain additionally dyspnea can be observed in some patients and it may progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 4  the transmission of sars-cov-2 is largely dependent on respiratory droplets generated through sneezing or coughing 5  the median incubation period of sars-cov-2 is estimated to be 51 days with 95 confidence interval of 45 to 58 days 6  the outbreak of sars-cov-2 was recognized as a global pandemic threat on march 11 2020 7  sars-cov-2 has a genomic sequence similarity of 79 with a previously known coronavirus protein with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 however the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 seems to be 10-20 times higher 9  it is believed that covid-19 pathogenesis may involve blockade of ace2 and subsequent imbalance between angiotensin-1-7 and angiotensin ii this suggests that ace2 may be further involved in pathogenesis beyond viral entry point 10  similar to sars-cov no specific treatment is currently available to combat covid-19 however management of ards does involve the use of oxygen-based therapy and antibiotics against possible sepsis 11  in attempts to fight covid-19 clinical trials are keep going to assess the effect of several antiviral agents like remdesivir 12  additionally computational modelling attempts have proposed the repurposing of several fda approved drugs against sars-cov-2 13 14  in the same time no vaccine was ever developed for any coronavirus however advanced techniques had been employed to generate potential sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates like mrna based vaccine viral vector vaccine and viral subunit vaccine 15  recently immunoinformatics tools had been used to screen sars-cov-2 proteins for potential b-cells and tcells epitopes 16 17  the prediction of these epitopes had enabled virtual design of peptide based vaccine against sars-cov-2 18 3 previously we have predicted several potential epitopes within sars-cov-2 spike protein sequence of interest was the linear b-cells epitope with sequence gfncyfplqsygf this epitope is believed to be part of spike protein receptor binding protein rbd that is involved in interaction with ace2 17 19  in the current study we have constructed a peptide-based vaccine design by combining seven potential epitopes predicted from our previously published findings 17  then we have evaluated this vaccine design by using several immunoinformatics tools to affirm its stability safety and efficiency the aim of this study is to present a multiepitope-based peptide vaccine design for potential use against sars-cov-2 a flowchart that summarizes the steps of vaccine construction and evaluation study can be seen in figure 1  we have selected seven potential epitopes for the construction of vaccine candidate the sequence of these epitopes can be seen in table 1  they have high antigenicity low allergenicity and good stability against selected proteases as predicted by our previously published study 17  table 1  linear epitopes previously predicted on sars-cov-2 spike protein crystal epitope sequence epitope type  major histocompatibility complex mhc molecule are highly polymorphic and expressed at  after population coverage analysis these seven epitopes were then merged together in a sequential manner by using aay linker this linker is considered as a cleavage site of mammalians proteasomes and can increase epitopes presentation by enhancing the formation of natural epitopes and reducing the formation of junctional epitopes  the secondary structure of vaccine construct was predicted by using psipred 40 tool 29 while tertiary structure was modelled by using sparks-x this web-based tool can recognize protein folding through sequence alignment 30 for these prediction tools the sequence of vaccine design was submitted as one letter code to further improve vaccine tertiary structure the generated pdb file was then submitted to galaxy refine server this refinement server applies molecular dynamics md simulation to implement repeated cycles of structural perturbation with subsequent relaxation 31 6 vaccine structure validation the peptide vaccine structure was submitted as pdb file to rampage server for md analysis was carried out for 10 nanoseconds by using the same protocol applied in our previously published article 14  the ability of peptide vaccine to activate various components of host immune system was predicted by using c-immsim server this modelling platform combines the dynamics of immune system together with genomic information 44  at first the vaccine sequence was  the selected six t-cells epitopes showed high predicted population coverage according to mhc restricted alleles according to figure 2  the worldwide coverage of these epitopes was the primary sequence of peptide vaccine was constructed by merging the seven potential epitopes together by using aay linker while the adjuvant human beta-defensin 2 chain a was linked to the n-terminus of vaccine construct by using the rigid linker eaaak the primary structure of peptide vaccine can be seen in figure 3 a as one letter format prediction of vaccine secondary structure as appeared in figure 3 b revealed that the percentage of strand -helix and coil are 10 53 and 37 respectively the tertiary structure of vaccine design was modelled by using sparks-x server with a z-score of 526 the model was further refined by using galaxy refine server with a root mean square deviation rmsd of 0496 from initial build the refined tertiary structure of peptide vaccine can be seen in figure 3 c and epitopes are also colored by gold light blue and red respectively 9 a summary of predicted physicochemical properties immunogenicity and allergenicity of vaccine construct can be observed in table 2 according to this table the peptide the validation results of vaccine refined tertiary structure can be observed in figure 4  based on analysis of ramachandran plot in figure 4 a  932 of residues are in favored position of torsional angles plot while 48 are in allowed region only 20 of the residues in the refined model are considered outliers then the z-score of the refined model was recorded to be -359 by using prosa-web tool this quality score is located within the z-scores range calculated for native proteins of similar size as can be seen in figure 4 b  the model quality was also assessed as presented in figure 4 c  by plotting predicting energy as a function of sequence position the plot for window size of 40 residues is smoother than 10 residues size as obvious our refined model may have some structural flaws as the predicted energy for window size of 40 residues jumps slightly higher than zero in part of the plot finally the overall quality score of errat server is reported to be 82645 this score represents the percentage of protein sequence with predicted error value that falls below rejection limit a plot of error value versus residues number can be seen in figure 4 d all the above structural validation results predict that the refined construct has a good stability with minor flaws candidate the 99 and 95 lines represent confidence interval for rejection limit molecular docking analysis of vaccine construct against tlr8 had generated many potential complexes an overview for docking result of the first ranked complex can be seen in figure   5  this vaccine-tlr8 complex has a geometric shape complementarity score of 17544 with approximate interface area of 274570 a cartoon representation for this complex is well presented in figure 5 a  according to analysis of protein-protein interface illustrated in figure 5 b the peptide vaccine was able to form 5 hydrogen bonds with tlr8 interface residues the anticipated length of these bonds is less than 35 angstrom and tlr8 can be seen in figure 6  based on total potential energy calculations in figure 6 a the complex looks to be stable with minimal changes in potential energy predicted throughout simulation period however the vaccine construct seems to exhibit a higher 12 flexibility per residue than tlr8 as noted from root mean square fluctuation rmsf calculations in figure 6 b the residues of peptide vaccine show a higher variation in position from its simulation time averaged position reference position the results of both molecular docking and dynamics simulation may indicate the preferential binding of vaccine design to toll-like receptor 8 an rmsf value of zero refers to the absence of residue in the molecule under simulation 13 finally the results of simulation for host immune response against injected vaccine can be seen in figure 7  as predicted by simulation server we found that three injections of vaccine construct with a time frame of 4 weeks between each two doses are necessary to produce loglasting and efficient immune response according to figure 7   a scalable topical vectored vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 2 3 4 mohammed rohaim a muhammad munir  the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused an 15 ongoing unprecedented global public health crises of coronavirus disease in 2019 16 covid-19 the precipitously increased death rates its impact on livelihood and 17 trembling economies warrant the urgent development of sars-cov-2 vaccine which 18 would be safe efficacious and scalable owing to unavailability of the vaccine we 19 propose a de novo synthesised avian orthoavulavirus 1 aoav-1-based topical 20 respiratory vaccine candidate against covid-19 avirulent strain of newcastle disease 21 virus proto-type virus of aoav-1 was engineered to express full length spike s 22  glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and major protective antigen of the sars-23 cov-2 broad-scale in vitro characterization of recombinant vaccine candidate 24 demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase hn of 25 aoav-1 and s protein of sars-cov-2 and comparable replication kinetics were 26 observed in cell culture model the recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively 27 replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin interestingly 28 incorporation of s protein of sars-cov-2 into the recombinant aoav-1 particles 29 attributed the sensitivity to anti-sars-cov-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-30 aoav-1 antiserum finally our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine 31 vector stably expressed s protein after multiple propagation in chicken embryonated 32 eggs and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics 33 of the recombinant taken together the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is 34 highly attenuated in primates per se safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human 35 and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against covid-19 for 36 clinical studies an outbreak of pneumonia was erupted in chinese seafood market in wuhan during 53 late 2019 and within a month of its origin on 30 january 2020 a public health 54 emergency of international concern was declared by the world health organization 55 who due to its high human-to-human transmission within next month the outbreak 56 of coronavirus disease in 2019 covid-19 soared among communities 57 unprecedentedly and spread across the globe and a pandemic was declared on 11 58 march 2020 by who a large proportion 80 of covid-19 infected patients 59 showed only moderate symptoms which led to staggering rate increase in global 60 spread of the infection the acute respiratory distress syndrome manifested in 20 61 of covid-19 patients caused substantial case fatality rates especially in elderly and 62 frail people with co-morbidities 1  the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the causative 65 agent of ongoing covid-19 pandemic belongs to the family coronavirdae within the 66 betacoronavirus non-structural proteins nsp 1-16 and multiple accessary proteins amongst these 71 viral proteins the s protein constitute a major protective antigen that elicit highly 72 specific antibodies mediated immune responses 2  therefore the s protein remained 73 the primary vaccine markers against coronaviruses currently there is no registered drugs or vaccines available to curb the pandemic 76 however multiple vaccines using a range of technologies are being developed or pre-77 clinically or clinically being investigated 3  amongst these an inactivated vaccine has 78 elicited strong antibodies which can neutralize multiple sars-cov-2 strains and can 79 partially or fully protect macaques against sars-cov-2 challenge 4  a chimpanzee 80 adeno chad-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length s gene of sars-cov-2 81 elicited humoral and cell-mediated responses in rhesus macaques 5  however it failed 82 to fully alleviated clinical signs in vaccinated macaques albeit reduced severity and 83 protection against pneumonia the chadox1 ncov-19 also failed to reduce the viral 84 replication in the nose highlighting the potential spread of sars-cov-2 through 85 sneezing even in vaccinated people 5  86 87 owing to multifaceted advantages the avian orthoavulavirus 1 aoav-1 proposes a 88 potential vaccine vector against sars-cov-2 specifically aoav-1 represented by 89 a type species newcastle disease virus ndv are exclusively cytoplasmic viruses 90 and therefore the viral gene segments are not integrated into the host genome which 91 raises their safety profile since these vectors lack natural recombination the 92 expression of transgenes is genetically stable additionally aoav-1 can infect multiple 93 species of animals the vaccines can be produced in chicken embryonated eggs and 94 multiple cell lines 6  given these and other features apathogenic strains of aoav-1 95 have been used as live attenuated vaccines against multiple viruses including 96 influenza sars human immunodeficiency virus 78  human parainfluenza rabies 9  97 nipah disease 10  rift valley fever 11  ebola and highly pathogenic h5n1 1213  98 importantly aoav-1 has appeared to be safe and effective in mice 1013  dogs 9  pigs 10  99 cattle 1415  sheep 14  african green and rhesus monkeys 1617 and humans 18-21  notably 100 the natural host of aoav-1 are birds and the vector is antigenically distinct from 101 common human pathogens therefore no pre-existing immunity in human make it an 102 ideal vector to deliver transgene effective and safely in the present study we de novo designed an aoav-1 vector and generated a 105 recombinant vaccine candidate by expressing full-length codon optimized s protein of 106 the sars-cov-2 at a pre-optimized gene junction this topical respiratory vaccine 107 candidate was fully characterized in vitro based on the infection and spreadability 108 within cells its sensitivity to anti-aoav-1 and anti-sars-cov-2 neutralizing 109 antibodies its replication kinetics and stability in chicken embryonated eggs the 110 raoav-1-sars-cov-2 is a scalable topical vectored vaccine candidate against 111 sars-cov-2 to be tested for safety and immunogenicity in animal studies 112 113 design and construction of aoav-1-sars-cov-2 vaccine candidate an 116 avirulent strain of aoav-1 was used to construct vaccine candidate against sars-117 cov-2 the full length antigenomic sequence of aoav-1 originally isolated from 118 asymptomatic wild birds was de novo synthesised to facilitate minigenome 119 transcription an autocatalytic and rule-of-six adhered hammerhead ribozyme 120 sequences was introduced in both 5 and 3-ends of the antigenome fig 1a  an expression cassette containing the kozak sequence ge gs ig and the orf for 123 the full-length s gene was codon-optimized for homo sapiens codon usage and 124 inserted into the unique pmei site between p and m genes which was originally 125 preserved during the cloning of complete antigenome fig 1a  the construct was 126 named raoav-1-sars-cov-2 whereas the aoav-1 without the insertion of the 127 foreign gene aoav-1-wt was used as infection control throughout the study the 128 orientation of the inserted s gene was confirmed by the nucleotide sequence analysis individually inoculated eggs using real-time pcr and hemagglutination assays has 134 identified successfully rescued raoav-1-sars-cov-2 viruses  fig 1  135 supplementary which were used to fully characterize in the presented study where a vast majority of raoav-1-sars-cov-2-infected cells expressed both hn and 144 s proteins simultaneously fig 1d  both recombinant and wild type aoav-1 isolates replicated at high titre in eggs 28 147 hauml data not shown the evaluation of the viral replication in the presence of 148 exogenous proteases in vero cells indicated that raoav-1 expressing codon 149 optimized s gene replicated at the level comparable to wild type aoav-1 fig 1e  150 the expression analysis of the s protein by western blot indicated a potent expression 151 of the full-length s protein in raoav-1-sars-cov-2-infected cells whereas expression 152 of the hn proteins was detected in both recombinant and wt aoav-1-infected cells 153  fig 1f and fig 3 supplementary  these results confirm that the expression of the 154 transgene s didnt interfere with the growth characteristics of the aoav-1 and could 155 be a replication competitive vaccine candidate exogenous trypsin independent growth characteristics of vaccine construct 158 to initiate virus replication the f protein of the aoav-1 has to be cleaved by cellular 159 proteases 22  in order to investigate the pre-requisite of exogenous trypsin-like 160 extracellular proteases for the infectivity of aoav-1 eggs-propagated raoav-1- of the infection confirmed a gradual spread of the infection fig 2b  co-expression 170 fluorescence profile highlighted the co-localization of both surface proteins fig 2c  171 similar to recombinant aoav-1 the aoav-1-wt replicated to a similar extent over the 172 course of two days post-infection without the need of exogenous extracellular 173 proteases and saturated level of expression of the hn protein was observed at 48 174 hours post-infection  fig 2d and fig 2 supplementary  the cumulative 175 fluorescence dynamics fig 2e  and fluorescence profile fig 2f confirmed the 176 active and progressive expression and hn-specific staining respectively taken  177 together these results confirm the active replication and expression of aoav-1 and 178 foreign genes in vero cells independently of exogenous trypsin the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 is sensitive to aoav-1 and sars-cov-2 antisera the 181 f and hn surface glycoproteins are critical for receptor binding as well as membrane 182 fusion which are indispensable for virus entry and subsequent initiation of the virus 183 replication 2223  in contrast the coronaviruses have only a single enveloped 184 glycoprotein which perform dual functions of receptor binding and membrane fusion 24  185 in order to understand the influence of the s protein of the sars-cov-2 on the 186 infectivity of recombinant virus the sensitivities of aoav-1 and sars-cov-2 antisera 187 were assessed and compared for neutralization as expected the aoav-1-wt was 188 resistant to mock antiserum neutralization and was almost fully neutralized by the 189 serum against the aoav-1 fig 3a  quantitatively the anti-aoav-1 antiserum 190 reduced the infection of aoav-1-wt in vero cells by 92 compared to the mock-191 neutralization fig 3b  neutralization analysis of the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 showed 192 a significant blockage of the virus replication by pre-incubation and subsequent 193 infection of raoav-1-sars-cov-2 with either anti-aoav-1 antiserum or anti-sars-194 cov-2 anti-serum fig 3c  there was no neutralization observed upon viruss 195 treatment with the nave mouse control serum compared to mock-neutralization as 196 high as 90 inhibition of the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 was observed with anti-aoav-1 197 antiserum and 40 inhibition was noticed using anti-sars-cov-2 anti-serum fig  198  3d  these observations confirm that the incorporation of s protein of sars-cov-2 199 into the recombinant aoav-1 particles attributed the sensitivity of the aoav-1 to anti-200 sars-cov-2 antiserum and anti-aoav-1 antiserum in vitro growth characterization of the vaccine construct in order to understand 203 the replication competence of raoav-1-sars-cov-2 and aoav-1-wt a multistep 204 growth kinetics was evaluated in vero cells the time-course quantitative 205 measurement of the genomic copies confirmed that the expression of the s gene didnt 206 interfere with the viral replication and the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 replicated 207 competitively and comparability with the aoav-1-wt fig 4a  the cell lysate from 208 same experimental setting was used to assess the expression of the aoav-1 209 structural proteins the expression analysis using western blotting demonstrated that 210 both aoav-1-wt fig 4b and raoav-1-sars-cov-2 fig 4c s-gene expression-confirmed viruses were passaged in 8-days-old embryonated 220 chicken eggs for five consecutive passages both raoav-1-sars-cov-2 and aoav-221 1-wt replicated substantially in eggs 28 hauml data not shown the comparative 222 replication competence was assessed between first and fifth eggs passaged viruses 223 in vero cells the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 expressing the s protein of the sars-cov-224 2 grew efficiently and at the level of the aoav-1-wt in the first passage as well as after 225 5 th passage in the embryonated eggs fig 5a  correspondingly the expression of 226 the structural protein of the aoav-1 further confirmed the stable propagation of the wt 227 and recombinant viruses at least for several passages fig 5b and fig 3  228  supplementary  the sequence integrity of the inserted s gene as well as the p and 229 m junction was assessed without any mutations additionally sequencing of the s 230 gene from the first and fifth passages confirmed no unwanted mutations in purified 231 viruses these results demonstrate that the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 expresses s gene 232 stably and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics 233 of the recombinants 234 235 the precipitously increasing deaths negative impact on lives and livelihood and 238 trembling economies warrant the urgent development of sars-cov-2 vaccine which 239 would be safe efficacious and scalable amongst experimental vaccines being 240 presented for sars-cov-2 the vectored-based vaccines hold potential for effective 241 vaccine against covid-19 3  however each viral vector inherit multiple advantages 242 and disadvantages and careful consideration of gene delivery system may pave the 243 way for an effective vaccine we propose here a pre-tested vaccine vector based on the recombinant apathogenic 246 strain of aoav-1 ie ndv we engineered aoav-1 to express the full-length s 247 glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 which is a vital viral neutralization and major protective while the mechanism of host range-restriction needs investigations it is known that 253 aoav-1 induces a strong interferon response in mammalian cells which in turn limit 254 its replication 2627  additionally sialic acid receptors for the viral attachment might show 255 fundamental differences between avian and mammalian hosts and thus define the 256 host restriction it has been observed that bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 another 257 paramyxovirus in the same family determine the host range restriction through 258 multiple viral proteins 28  notwithstanding aoav-1 are clearly highly restricted to 259 primates and this selective replication is irrespective of any of the known pathotypes 260 such as mesogenic or lentogenic strains of aoav-1 29  261 262 in addition to above mentioned factors the aoav-1 carries a range of advantages 263 over multiple other vectors similar to other paramyxoviruses aoav-1 enters host cells by direct fusion at the 277 plasma membrane through a ph-independent mechanism 3233  the aoav-1 can also 278 enter host cells by an endocytic pathway the entry of the aoav-1 in the cell is then 279 mediated by the surface fusion f glycoprotein which is also a major determinant of 280 aoav-1 virulence in birds 34  the viral infectivity requires cleavage of the f protein 281 through the intracellular ubiquitous proteases including furin allowing disseminated 282 replication in multiples organs and tissues a mechanism similar to aoav-1 raoav-283 1-sars-cov-2 entry the cells through proteolytic cleavage of the s protein 24  the 284 trypsin-independent infectivity of raoav-1-sars-cov-2 as was observed in our 285 study facilitated the vector propagation in cells culture model as well as embryonated 286 chicken eggs it has previously been shown that insertion of the transgene may allow the vector 289 sensitive to neutralization by antibodies which are specific to the inserted protein and 290 may facilitate the seepage of neutralization by vector-specific neutralizing 291 antibodies 25 35  the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 expresses both the native structural hn 292 protein as well as s glycoprotein and therefore the entry into the cell may be attributed 293 to the aoav-1-like or sars-cov-2-like in conjunction to this hypothesis the anti-294 aoav-1 antiserum as well as anti-sars-cov-2 could substantially block the entry of 295 the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 additionally the recombinant aoav-1-sars-cov-2 296 offers an exciting system to underpin functional interactions between native and 297 foreign envelope glycoproteins in one viral particle recently insertion of the foreign genes in the backbone of the aoav-1 has been 300 practiced for multiple viruses including influenza sars human immunodeficiency 301 virus 735  human parainfluenza rabies 9  nipah disease 10  rift valley fever 11  ebola and 302 highly pathogenic h5n1 1213  in several studies it has been demonstrated that 303 insertion of the transgene into the genomes of aoav-1 resulted in reduced 304 pathogenicity in poultry birds this safety was maintained even after the expression of 305 the ha gene from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus 11-13  sustained stable and 306 progressive replication of both wt and recombinant viruses demonstrated effective 307 spread within cells independently 308 309 taken together our results demonstrated that the recombinant vector expressing s 310 protein propagated stably in chicken embryonated eggs for several consecutive 311 passages and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth 312 characteristics of the recombinants the presented respiratory vaccine candidate has 313 the potential for further development as vaccine vector to be available for expedited 314 vaccine development for pre-clinical and clinical studies 315 316 cells and viruses aoav-1-wt vaccine vector was rescued as described previously 36 have assessed the optimal gene expression when inserted between p and m 333 gene 35 37 38  this arrangement of the gene is identical among all aoav-1 334 in order to offer a competitive reverse genetic system as a novel vaccine vector an 336 avirulent strain of aoav-1 was used carrying lentogenic-alike eg ndv cleavage site 337 and pathogenicity patent pending on the technology the full length antigenomic 338 sequence of aoav-1 originally isolated from asymptomatic wild birds was partially 339 de novo synthesised nbs biologicals uk using a novel sequence modification 340 approach rest of the genome length mainly constituting around the p gene was 341 cloned using overlapping pcrs the entire cassette was then shuttled into the 342 tvt7r00 addgene plasmid 98631 in order to avoid incorporation of an extra 343 non-viral gene residues into the transcribed minigenome and efficient transcription of 344 the gene an autocatalytic and rule of six adhered hhrz was introduced at the 5-345 end and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme hdvrz at the 3 end of the antigenome an expression cassette for the full-length s gene was first in silico generated 348 containing the kozak sequence ge gs ig and the orf for the full length s gene 349 was codon-optimized for homo sapiens codon usage and inserted into the unique 350 pmei site between p and m genes which was originally preserved during the cloning 351 of complete antigenome the construct was named raoav-1-sars-cov-2 whereas 352 the aoav-1 without the insertion of the foreign gene aoav-1-wt was used as 353 infection control throughout the study the orientation of the inserted s gene was 354 confirmed by the nucleotide sequence analysis at the time of cloning as well as during 355 the propagation of the vector in cells and chicken embryonated eggs the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 and aoav-1-wt were used to rescue the infectious viruses 358 as described previously 36 at -80 before inoculating into 8-days-old embryonated chicken eggs after additional 365 three days individual eggs were screened using hemagglutination assay and real-366 time pcr as we described before 39 40 41 permeabilized with 01 triton x-100 for 10

and b-cell epitopes neha jain uma shankar   prativa majee amit kumar  novel sars coronavirus sars-cov-2 has caused a pandemic condition world-wide and has been declared as public health emergency of international concern by who in a very short span of time the community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of china italy spain and usa among others the prophylactic solution against sars-cov-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its rna genome herein we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 with high antigenicity safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent the whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved antigenic non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against covid-19 infection these epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental sars-cov-2 strain with high efficacy the vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor tlr3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity further the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product thus this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating covid-19  should robustly activate both the humoral and the cell-mediated immunity to establish strong protection against the pathogen 10  the antibody generation by b-cell activation as well as acute viral clearance by t-cells along with virus-specific memory generation by cd8 tcells are equally important to develop immunity against the coronavirus 11  in case of respiratory virus like coronaviruses the mucosal immunity plays an essential role and therefore route of administration of the vaccine is also important in the context of vaccine development vaccines designed against previously reported sars-cov and mers-cov majorly focuses on the spike protein of virus which consists of s1 and s2 subunits bearing the receptor binding domain rbd of the virus and cell fusion machinery respectively mutations in the spike protein have also been reported to be responsible for the change in host cell tropism 12  the s protein is considered most antigenic and thereby can evoke immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus attachment to the host cells 13  other viral proteins which were explored for vaccine development include n protein e protein and the nsp16 proteins 14 15 16 17 18  almost all the platforms for vaccine development for sars-cov and mers-cov have been investigated including the lifeattenuated ones recombinant viruses sub-unit protein vaccines dna vaccines viral vectorbased vaccines nanoparticle-based vaccines etc which may form the base for the vaccine designing against the newly emerged sars-cov-2 10 19  here we have designed a multiepitope-based vaccine for the sars-cov-2 using next generation vaccinology approach where the recently available genome and proteome of the sars-cov-2 were maneuvered and a potential vaccine candidate was conceived similar strategy was employed previously for sars-cov and mers-cov 20 21 22 23 24 25 as well as certain findings are reported for the newly emerged sars-cov-2 26 27 28  while immunoinformatics techniques was utilized by groups to predict the b-cell and cytotoxic t-cell epitopes in the sars-cov-2 surface glycoprotein n protein 27 28 29  others have utilized the information to design epitope-based vaccine based on the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein 26  along with the structural proteins utilizing the non-structural and accessory proteins for the vaccine development can aid in better development of an efficacious vaccine for long term by neutralizing the mutation rate of this rna virus in this study we explored the whole proteome of sars-cov-2 to scrutinize the highly conserved antigenic epitopes for the construction of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can effectively elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against covid-19 the constructed vaccine product has high population coverage and along with adaptive immunity can as well lead to initiation of innate immune response further enhancing the generation of memory immunity with the continuous transmission of the virus across borders and increasing health burden on the global scale sars-cov-2 demands an urgent immunization therapy as depicted by shan lu the community acquired coronavirus infection caci caused by this virus can shatter the socio-economic condition worldwide and the development of vaccine against the sars-cov-2 should be encouraged to manage the present situation as well as it can serve as a prototype for other coronaviruses 30 31  thereby our analysis provides a platform for the development of a protective vaccine candidate that can be tested in-vitro and in-vivo and may lead to faster development of an efficient vaccine against the sars-cov-2 infection the complete proteome of latest reported novel wuhan strain of sars

structure of the multi-epitope vaccine construct was further evaluated for its stability in the real environment by simulating it in a water sphere using namd-standard molecular dynamics tool httpswwwksuiuceduresearchnamd by using parallel processors the required structure files psf were generated by psfgen using visual molecular dynamics vmd tool v193 by utlizing charmm force fields for proteins initially a 10000 steps energy minimization was performed followed by subsequent heating the system from 0 k to 310 k thereafter a 20 ns standard molecular dynamics was performed and

escherichia coli k12 satrain the construct was first converted to cdna using reverse translate tool available at expasy server the resultant dna was further optimized for enhanced protein expression by using jcat server 55  finally the cdna construct was inserted into the pet28a  vector using hindiii and bamhi restriction sites the complete proteome of the wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 nucleotide accession number -nc0455122 was retrieved from the ncbi database sars-cov-2 proteome consists of a polyprotein orf1ab and several structural proteins orf1ab encodes for various non-structural proteins including host translation inhibitor nsp1 rna dependent rna polymerase rnrp helicase guanine-n7 methyltransferase etc that plays a critical role in the virus multiplication and survival inside the host structural proteins include spike glycoprotein envelope protein membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein the fasta sequences of all these proteins were retrieved from ncbi and used for epitope screening  table 1  all the sequences were analyzed for their antigenic nature by using vaxijen server which is based upon auto cross covariance acc transformation vaxijen classifies the proteins into antigens and non-antigens solely based on the physiochemical properties and is sequence alignment independent the acc score threshold for the virus model is kept 04 that increases the prediction accuracy all the sars-cov-2 proteins except nsp16 2-o-ribose methyltransferase resulted in the acc score higher than 04 depicting the antigenic nature of the viral proteome table 1  all the antigenic proteins were further screened for the presence of htl ctl and b-cell epitopes by using various tools and databases  figure 1  t-lymphocytes play a central role in activating the cell mediated innate and adaptive immune response against the foreign particles as well they are the sole players in generating immunological memory that provides long lasting immune response thus the vaccinology approach revolves around the screening of proteome for the high affinity helper t table s2  overlapping sequences were merged into one or both mhc class i and class ii binding epitopes apart from cellular mediated immunity the humoral immune response mediates pathogen clearance in the antibody dependent manner hence the proteome of sarc-cov-2 was further scanned for linear b-cell epitopes by using abcpred server for higher selectivity and sensitivity the threshold of abcpred was kept 09 the predicted epitopes were checked for their antigenicity allergenicity and toxicity and the best epitopes were taken for further consideration on the basis of above criteria we received one b-cell epitope each for nucleocapsid guanine-n7 methyltransferase exon orf3a orf7a and surface glycoprotein supplementary table s3  the locations of the selected epitopes in the respective protein structures are represented by figure 2  overall the antigenic 13 htl and 12 ctl epitopes having highest affinity for the respective hla alleles and 5 b-cell epitopes that are non-allergenic non-toxic and can generate a potential immune response were selected for incorporation into the multi-epitope vaccine construct the presence of conserved epitopes in a vaccine can lead to an effective immunization against all the strains of the pathogen thus the selected htl ctl and bcl epitopes were analyzed for their conservancy among the various human infecting strains of coronavirus interestingly all the selected epitopes were 100  conserved throughout the coronavirus family and this can lead to a robust vaccine development figure 3c  an ideal vaccine should harbor conserved epitopes have multi-valency and can elicit both cellular and humoral mediated immune response in the host a subunit vaccine contains minimal elements that are antigenic and required for the stimulation of prolonged protective or therapeutic immune response in the recent times various reports have shown the construction of multi subunit vaccine by utilizing highly antigenic htl ctl and bcl epitopes herein we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate by combining 13 htl 12 ctl and 4 bcl epitopes that were highly conserved antigenic non-toxic and non-allergens  figure 4  in the recent times various small peptides are been explored that acts as an adjuvant and can potentiate the multi-epitope vaccine mediated immune response by activating humoral immunity taking this into consideration apart from the conserved epitopes four adjuvants were also added so as to boost the protective immune response against sars-cov- table 2  antigenicity is a preliminary requisite of a successful vaccine candidate a vaccine construct must possess both immunogenicity and antigenicity to elicit the humoral and cell-mediated immune response upon analyzing the vaccine construct sequence in vaxijen server the constructed vaccine was found to be antigenic in nature with an overall prediction score of 06199 the score signifies the antigenic potential of the vaccine construct that may have the potential to evoke the immune response inside the host on allergenicity analysis all the three tools algpred allergenfp and allertop supported the non-allergenic nature of the vaccine construct while toxicity analysis revealed the non-toxic behavior of the construct  table 2  in summary the constructed epitope was observed to be stable soluble antigenic non-allergenic and nontoxic secondary and tertiary structure helps in the functional annotation of the multi-epitope vaccines it also helps in analyzing the interaction of this vaccine construct with the immunological receptors like tlrs secondary structure of the protein was analyzed by using sopma and psipred server that revealed the presence of 40  alpha helix 20  -sheet 30  coils and 6   turns in the vaccine construct  figure 5 and supplementary figure s3  tertiary structure of

to further refine the modelled structure 3d refine and galaxyrefine were utilized that leads to 974  residues in the most favoured region and 26  residues in the additionally allowed region the quality factor of the refined structure was observed to be 9429 depicting the improvement of the modelled structure  figure 6d -f refined structure of the model construct was further check for its stability in real environment by simulating it for 20 ns in a water sphere 10000 steps energy minimization was performed to minimize the potential energy of the system unnecessary or false geometry of the protein structures are repaid by performing energy minimization resulting in a more stable stoichiometry before energy minimization the potential energy was observed to be -4474512005 kcalmol after 10000 steps the protein was minimized with a potential energy of -6760404692 kcalmol  figure 7a  the system was subsequently heated from 0 k to 310 k and then 10 ns molecular dynamic simulation

and rmsd was calculated upon analysing the rmsd of sars-cov-2 vaccine construct it was observed that the system gained equilibrium at 4 ns and then remained constant till 10 ns depicting the stability of the vaccine construct  figure 7c  furthermore upon analysing the change in kinetic potential and total energy of the system it was observed that after a quick initial change in all the three they remained constant throughout the simulation further strengthening the stability of the vaccine construct  figure 7d-f  furthermore the bond energy vdw energy dihedral and improper dihedral energy analysis revealed no change throughout the 10 ns dynamics simulation root mean square fluctuation rmsf analysis revealed the rigidness of the atoms in vaccine construct with a slight mobility observed at  120 and 501 residues supplementary figure s4  thus simulation analysis revealed the stability of the vaccine construct in the real environment the refined vaccine construct structure was therefore used for interaction analysis with immunological receptor tlr3 proteinprotein docking of immune receptor tlr3 and the constructed vaccine was carried out using cluspro server in total 30 tlr3-vaccine

construct interacted with the ligand binding grove of tlr-3 generating a strong tlr3-vaccine construct complex the stability of the complex was further analyzed by performing 10ns standard molecular dynamics simulation studies using namd suite the 10000 steps energy minimization of the complex lead to the generation of a minimized energy complex with energy of -7567915601 kcalmol  figure 8c  after subsequent heating the system from 0 k to 310 k the temperature was kept constant throughout  figure 8d  energy plots depicted no major changes throughout the simulation  figure 8e -g and supplementary figure s5  rmsf analysis of the complex showed a mobility region at 740 th residue and 1100 residue of the tlr3-vaccine complex  figure 8h  on trajectory analysis the rmsd plot was constructed that revealed the major deviations during the initial 15 ns thereafter the system remained constant till 10 ns for the insertion of the vaccine construct into a plasmid vector the 602 amino acid long protein sequence was reverse translated to cdna of 1806 nucleotide length the expression system of the expression host varies with each other and the cdna needs to be adapted as per the host codon usage for the optimal expression of the vaccine product in escherichia coli k12 host the resultant cdna was codon optimized according using jcat server also during optimization rho-independent transcription terminator and prokaryotic ribosomal binding sites were avoided in middle of the cdna sequence so as to generate an optimal and complete protein expression further for inserting the construct in the cloning vector the cleavage sites of bamhi and hindiii were also avoided the cai value codon adaptation index of the cdna before adaptation was observed to be 05379 and a gc content of 5952   figure 9a  after adaptation the cai score of the improved sequence was increased to 0946 with 5254  gc content  figure 9b and supplementary data s1 the enhanced cai score depicts the presence of most abundant codons in escherichia coli k12 the adapted cdna sequence was used for in silico cloning purpose escherichia coli k12 strain was selected as a host for cloning purpose as the expression and purification of multi-epitope vaccines are easier in this bacterium pet28a expression vector was cleaved using bamhi and hindiii restriction enzyme and the cdna was inserted near the ribosome binding site using snapgene 6x histidine tag was added at the 3 end for the isolation and purification of the vaccine construct  figure 9c  severely affecting humans worldwide the sars-cov-2 is highly contagious virus with a high mortality rate especially in immunocompromised and elderly persons vaccines are the utmost need of the time to succumb the rising infections due to covid-19 and represent the best way to combat infectious diseases in the community conventional vaccine development methods are time-consuming laborious and expensive and in this regard the in-silico immuno-informatics approach have proved to a boon 59  moreover the availability of large number of efficient tools to predict the immuno-determinants and large database of information facilitate and accelerate this whole process of vaccine designing 60  multiepitope vaccines are designed by using the most antigenic conserved part of the pathogens proteins that makes them more effective and can help in combating the high mutation rate in rna viruses these epitope-based vaccines have added advantages of being safe stable highly specific cost-curtailing easy to

vaccines for covid-19 some clinical trials are in progress 10 lopinavir and ritonavir were used in preliminary clinical studies 3 nevertheless in the past two decades a massive amount of work has been done to understand the molecular basis of the coronavirus infection and evolution develop an effective treatment in forms of both vaccines and antiviral drugs and propose efficient measures for viral detection and prevention 11 12 13 structures of many individual proteins of sars mers and related coronaviruses as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins have been explored along with the experimental testing of anti-viral properties of small compounds 14 15 16 in this context the use of bioinformatics approaches may help fill the gap of missing data and improve the process of knowledge discovery by elucidating molecular mechanisms behind virus replication the process of viral attachment to the host cells and the effect on the host molecular pathways 17 the final understanding of the molecular action of the virus may improve or accelerate the development of anti-viral therapeutic approaches using information and data available for other coronaviruses therefore understanding the molecular effects of this virus on human proteins play a pivotal role in prioritizing pharmacological strategies 18 in this review the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid n-terminal domain termed as sars-cov-2 n-ntd as a model for understanding the molecular interactions that govern sars-cov-2 n-ntd binding to ribonucleotides is described and the unique rna binding site characteristics are discussed which in turn will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral n protein and viral replication in sars-cov-2 and highly related virus sars-cov furthermore it is attempted to propose suitable vaccine candidates by identifying b-cell and t-cell epitopes with computational approaches for drug and vaccine design structures of many individual proteins of sars mers and related coronaviruses as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins have been explored along with the experimental testing of anti-viral properties of small compounds 16 however experimental data of the same scale for sars-cov-2 may take years to obtain by the research community by leveraging the previously known information on genome sequences as well as protein structure and function bioinformaticians have been successfully helping the virologists by structurally characterizing proteins of novel viruses determining the evolutionary trajectories identifying interactions with host proteins and providing other important biological insights in particular a plethora of results have been achieved through comparative or homology modeling principles 1920 in addition to the global structural genomics initiatives focusing on determining the 3d structures of proteins on a genome-scale 21 and specific efforts on rapid structural characterization of proteins in emerging viruses 2223 multiple works have used comparative modeling to predict the structures of protein-protein interaction complexes 24 25 26 facilitating structure-based drug discovery 202728 inferring protein functions 29 determining the macromolecular interaction network 30 31 32 and providing molecular insights into viral evolution 33 34 35 by providing a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of sars-cov-2 and using this information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related sars coronavirus sars-cov-2 has 16 predicted non-structural proteins constituting a polyprotein followed by 13 downstream orfs surface orf3a orf3b envelope membrane orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 nucleocapsid orf9a orf9b and orf10 the three viral species whose proteins shared the highest similarity were consistently the same human sars sars- cov bat coronavirus btcov as well as another bat betacoronavirus btrf-betacov 36 sars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus with single-stranded rna genomes like mers-cov and sars-cov the first two-thirds of viral 30 kb rna genome mainly named as orf1ab region translates into two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab and encodes most of the non-structural proteins nsp 37 the rest parts of the virus genome encode accessory proteins and four essential structural proteins including spike s glycoprotein small envelope e protein matrix m protein and nucleocapsid n protein 3738 current antiviral drugs developed to treat coronavirus cov infections primarily target s protein the 3c-like 3cl and papain-like plp proteases 3940 because mutant viruses in the s protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with different host-cell receptor binding patterns 39 as well as antibody-dependent enhancement ade effects of s protein antibodies are found in mers coronavirus 41 there are several limitations on targeting s protein for antiviral approaches antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically act on the cellular homologous protease resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects therefore novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections caused by this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 fig 1
 the cov n protein is a multifunctional rna-binding protein necessary for viral rna transcription and replication 42 it plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteins during packaging the rna genome regulating viral rna synthesis during replication transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism 4243 the primary functions of n protein are binding to the viral rna genome and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structure or ribonucleoprotein rnp complex 4445 in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that n protein bound to leader rna and was critical for maintaining highly ordered rna conformation suitable for replicating and transcribing the viral genome 434546 more studies implicated that n protein regulated host-pathogen interactions such as actin reorganization host cell cycle progression and apoptosis 4748 the n protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection capable of inducing protective immune responses against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 49 50 51 the common domain architectures of coronavirus n protein are consisting of three distinct but highly conserved parts an n-terminal rna-binding domain ntd a c-terminal dimerization domain ctd and intrinsically disordered central serarg sr-rich linker previous studies have revealed that the ntd are responsible for rna binding ctd for oligomerization and sr-rich linker for primary phosphorylation respectively 52 53 54 the crystal structures of sars-cov n-ntd 55 infectious bronchitis virus ibv n-ntd 5657 hcov-oc43 n-ntd 53 and mouse hepatitis virus mhv n-ntd 58 have been solved the covs n-ntd have been found to associate with the 3 end of the viral rna genome possibly through electrostatic interactions additionally several critical residues have been identified for rna binding and virus infectivity in the n-terminal domain of coronavirus n proteins 58 59 60 however the structural and mechanistic basis for newly emerged novel sars-cov-2 n protein remains largely unknown understanding these aspects should facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block the coronavirus replication transcription and viral assembly 61 kang et al 62 reported the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid n-terminal domain termed as sars-cov-2 n-ntd as a model for understanding the molecular interactions that govern sars-cov-2 n-ntd binding to ribonucleotides this finding will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral n protein and viral replication in sars-cov-2 and highly related virus sars-cov 62 angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the host receptor by sars-cov-2 to infect human cells viruses bind to host receptors on the target cell surface to establish infection membrane proteins mediated membrane fusion allowed the entry of enveloped viruses 63 as recently reported both ncov and sars-cov could use ace2 protein to gain entry into the cells 64 since the outbreak many data analysis have shown a wide distribution of ace2 across human tissues including lung 65 liver 66 stomach 67 ileum 67 colon 67 and kidney 68 indicating that sars-cov-2 may infect multiple organs however these data showed that at2 cells the main target cell of sars-cov-2 in the lung expressed rather low levels of ace2 68 hence the ncovs may depend on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its infection it is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their host factors 69 for example hoffmann et al recently showed that sars-cov-2-s use ace2 for entry and depends on the cellular protease tmprss2 for priming 70 showing that 2019- ncov infections also require multiple factors understanding the receptors usage by the viruses could facilitate the development of intervention strategies therefore identifying the potential co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for sars-cov-2 is of great significance although ace2 is reported to be expressed in the lung liver stomach ileum kidney and colon its expressing levels are rather low especially in the lung 71 sars-cov-2 may use co-receptorsauxiliary proteins as ace2 partners to facilitate the virus entry 72 to identify the potential candidates 73 explored the single-cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single-cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported rna virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins consistent with other recent reports 73 confirmed that ace2 was mainly expressed in lung at2 liver cholangiocyte colon colonocytes esophagus keratinocytes ileum ecs rectum ecs stomach epithelial cells and kidney proximal tubules intriguingly 73 found that the candidate co-receptors manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ace2 across 13 human tissues are all peptidases including anpep dpp4 and enpep among them anpep and dpp4 are the known receptors for human covs suggesting enpep as another potential receptor for human covs the viruses target host cells via binding host receptors before engaging the infection cycle ace2 was proved to be the cell receptor of sars-cov-2 the same receptor as sars-cov 6570 the expression profiles of ace2 across different cell types of different organs will reveal clues of the virus transmission routes and its potential pathogenesis in previous studies ace2 was found to express in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon alveolar type ii cells in the lung liver cholangiocyte and kidney proximal tubules 6667 these findings suggested that the clinical symptoms of hepatic failure respiratory injury acute kidney injury or diarrhoea may be associated with the pervasive ace2 expressing cells in these tissues however we and others found that ace2 is lowly expressed especially in the lung the main target organ of ncovs raising the possible existence of co-receptors facilitating ncov infection it is well recognized that ssrna viruses tend to have multiple receptors 69 for example ace2 cd209 dendritic cell-specific icam-3-grabbing non-integrin 1 clec4g c-type lectin domain family 4 member g and clec4m c-type lectin domain family 4 member m are receptors of sars-cov 7174 also other membrane proteins may also assist virus entry 63 since the viral receptors and co-receptors should be co-expressed on the same cell types single-cell co-expression patterns covering 400 membrane proteins and 51 known viral receptors was analyzed 64 after calculating gene expression similarity they found anpep enpep and dpp4 are the top three genes correlated with ace4 r  08 interestingly both anpep and dpp4 are viral receptors of human coronaviruses 75 while enpep is also a peptidase despite that its involvement in virus infection is unclear for mysterious reasons human coronaviruses use peptidases as their receptors 76 in addition li et al 77 showed co-expression profiles of these molecules indicating that different human covs target similar cell types across different human tissues vitamin a supplementation reduced morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases such as measles diarrheal disease measles-related pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection and malaria as described by semba et al 78 keil et al 79 had reported that vitamin b2 and uv light effectively reduced the titer of mers-cov in human plasma products atherton et al 80 had reported that vitamin c increased the resistance of chick embryo tracheal organ cultures to avian coronavirus infection in addition the decreased vitamin d status in calves had been reported to cause the infection of bovine coronavirus 81 vitamin e deficiency had been reported to intensify the myocardial injury of coxsackievirus b3 a kind of rna viruses infection in mice 82 protection d1 the omega-3 pufa-derived lipid mediator could markedly attenuate influenza virus replication via rna export machinery 83 dietary selenium deficiency that causes oxidative stress in the host can alter a viral genome so that a normally benign or mildly pathogenic virus can become highly virulent in the deficient host under oxidative stress 84 the combination of zinc and pyrithione at low concentrations inhibits the replication of sars coronavirus 85 iron is required for both host and pathogen and iron deficiency can impair host immunity while iron overload can cause oxidative stress to propagate harmful viral mutations 86 a combination of interferon--2a with ribavirin was administered to patients with severe mers-cov infection and the survival of these patients was improved 87 during the sars outbreak in 2003 intravenous gammaglobulin ivig was used extensively in singapore however one-third of critically ill patients developed venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism despite the use of low-molecular-weight heparin prophylactic 88 thymosin -1 could increase resistance to glucocorticoid-induced death of the thymocyte 89 thymosin -1 could also be used as an immune enhancer to sars patients and it was effective in controlling the spread of the disease 9091 thymopentin tp5 munox a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active site of thymopoietin had been shown to restore antibody production in old mice 92 levamisole can act as either an immunostimulant agent or an immunosuppressive agent depending upon the dosing and the timing 93 luo et al 94 had speculated that nucleocapsid protein np of sars-cov played an important role in the process of virus particle assembly and release and it might also bind to human cyclophilin a chymotrypsin-like 3c-like and papain-like protease plp are coronavirus encoded protein they have an essential function for coronaviral replication and also have an additional function for inhibition of host innate immune responses 95 cinanserin an old drug is well-known for serotonin receptor antagonists it could inhibit the 3 chymotrypsin-like 3c-like protease and was a promising inhibitor of replication of sars-cov 96 flavonoids are an important class of natural products and have several subgroups which include chalcones flavones flavonols and isoflavones 97 other flavonoids herbacetin isobavachalcone quercetin 3--d-glucoside and helichrysetin were also found to be able to block the enzymatic activity of mers-cov3clpro 98 papain-like protease plp of human coronavirus is a novel viral-encoded deubiquitinase and is an ifn antagonist for inhibition of host innate antiviral immune response diarylheptanoids is a natural product and is extracted from the stem bark of alnus japonica it was able to inhibit papain-like protease of sars-cov 95 angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 is a type i integral membrane protein which that functions as a carboxypeptidase and is the first human homolog of ace besides ace2 is also a functional receptor of sars-cov and it mediates virus entry into the cell through binding with spike s protein 99100 zhang et al 101 reported that covid-19 used ace2 as a sole receptor for the entry but did not use other coronavirus receptors aminopeptidase n and dipeptidyl peptidase for the entry blocking the binding of s protein to ace2 is important for the treatment of sars-cov infection 102 one recombinant human monoclonal antibody mab single-chain variable region fragments scfvs 80r against the s1 domain of s protein of sars-cov from two nonimmune human antibody libraries the mab could efficiently neutralize sars-cov and inhibit syncytia formation between cells expressing the s protein and those expressing the sars-cov receptor ace2 were found by sui et al 103 chloroquine has many interesting biochemical properties including antiviral effects in addition it had been used against viral infection 104 emodin is an anthraquinone compound derived from genus rheum boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of hiv infection lopinavir lpv is usually combined with ritonavir rtv to increase and polygonum and it is also a virucidal agent 105 emodin could significantly block the interaction between the s protein of sars-cov and ace2 106 promazine an anti-psychotic drug shares a similar structure with emodin it has been found to exhibit a significant effect in inhibiting the replication of sars-cov 107 as compared to emodin promazine exhibited potent inhibition of the binding of s protein to ace2 these findings suggested that emodin and promazine might be able to inhibit sars-cov infectivity by blocking the interaction of s protein and ace2 therefore the monoclonal antibody scfv80r chloroquine emodin and promazine could be used as choices for the treatment of covid-19 nicotianamine is an important metal-ligand in plants 108 and it is found a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 inhibitor in soybean 109 so it is another potential option to be used to reduce the infection of covid-19 ribavirin a broad-spectrum antiviral agent is routinely used to treat hepatitis c 110 morgenstern et al 111 had reported that ribavirin and interferon- synergistically inhibited the replication of sars-associated coronavirus in animal and human cell lines given adverse reactions and the lack of in vitro efficacy the use of ribavirin should be seriously considered for the treatment of covid-19 even in combination with other antiviral drugs the combination of lopinavir lpv with ritonavir rtv is widely used as a boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of hiv infection 112 kim et al 113 had also reported a successful case of mers-cov disease treated with triple combination therapy lpvrtv ribavirin and ifn-2a remdesivir rdv a nucleoside analog gs-5734 had been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus in vitro and to restrain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in vivo 114 recently the antiviral activity of rdv and ifn- was found to be superior to that of lpvrtvifn against mers-cov in vitro and in vivo 115 therefore the use of rdv with ifn- could be a better choice for the treatment of covid-19 comparing with that of the triple combination of lpvrtvifn however randomized and controlled trials are still needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir yamamoto et al 116 had found that nelfinavir could strongly inhibit the replication of sars-cov arbidol and its derivatives arbidol mesylate had been reported to have antiviral activity against the pathogen of sars in the cell cultures and arbidol mesylate was nearly 5 times as effective as arbidol in reducing the reproduction of sars virus in the cultured cells 117 nitric oxide no is a gas with diverse biological activities and is produced from arginine by no synthases 118 akerstrm et al 119 had reported that organic no donor s-nitroso- n-acetylpenicillamine could significantly inhibit the replication cycle of sars-cov in a concentration-dependent manner therefore no inhalation could be also chosen as an option for the treatment of severely covid-19 infected patients table 1
 computational methods can be utilized for the design and engineering of drugs 120121 the low time requirements of computational methods are conducive for high throughput screening of available drugs to identify potential drugs for novel diseases as well as to predict the adverse effects of novel drugs 122 development of novel drugs is a time-consuming process and generally several years of work are required for clinical approval 121 drug repositioning also known as repurposing is an effective strategy to combat novel diseases caused by infectious agents that spread rapidly 123 drugs that have been approved for some disease are safe for human use and only their effectiveness against the disease of interest needs to be established 124 in life-threatening cases where there is no alternative medicine or vaccine such a drug repurposing strategy is particularly attractive however clinical trials are necessary to ensure that such treatment is better than a placebo 125 lopinavir and ritonavir were identified in earlier studies to target the main protease mpro of sars virus the protein sequences of covid-19 main protease sars-cov-2 mpro and sars-cov mpro are 96 identical 126 in several early studies the similarities in the sequence of a potential target for covid-19 to that of the sars mpro were utilized to build a model for the structure of sars- cov-2 mpro 126 homology based models were utilized to screen a library of compounds to predict that nelfinavir an approved antiviral protease inhibitor is a potential drug for covid-19 122 the sequence similarity of the sars-cov-2 mpro to the sars mpro is sufficiently high to build a good model for the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro 123127 however the predictions of virtual screening studies and binding energy calculations are generally more accurate if a high-resolution experimental structure of the target is available the recent availability of the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for covid-19 as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the mpro was utilized as the target for virtual high throughput screening 120 indicating that the results confirm earlier preliminary reports based on studies of homologs that some of the drugs approved for the treatment of other viral infections also have the potential for the treatment of covid-19 therefore approved anti-viral drugs that target proteases were ranked for potential effectiveness against covid-19 and novel candidates for drug repurposing were identified there is an urgent need for the development of anti-viral drugs and vaccines against the 2019- ncov virus due to the high mortality rate of patients during the epidemic and pandemic outbreak of new viral pathogens the conventional method of development of drugs and vaccination is not possible to control as it is a time-consuming process 128129 consequently the rapid approach based on in-silico informatics has become very popular with recent advances in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases 130 131 132 the continuous increase of patients and a high mortality rate of sars-cov-2 infection highlight the urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine 133 the aim of this is to use to computational approach to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates the spike protein in the novel coronavirus sequence is used to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates for anti-viral drug design receptor-binding protein of novel coronavirus present in the n-terminal of spike protein is homology modeled and used as a protein receptor 134 3c like proteinase 3clpro plays a role in viral pathogenicity and replication by clevaging the polyprotein the inhibitors of 3clpro can block the clevage reaction thereby controlling viral replication and pathogenicity 135 the natural inhibitors were used as ligands and docked with homology modelled coronavirus receptor binding protein 136 for vaccine design the full sequence of the spike protein of novel coronavirus is used to predict b-cell and t-cell epitopes the select best t-cell epitopes based on antigenicity used as peptides and docked with human allele protein the computational approach is proposed for drug and vaccine design 120 to explore suitable natural inhibitors for the n-terminal receptor-binding domain of spike protein the spike protein sequences were collected from a protein database and also they were analyzed with various bioinformatics tools attempting to identify suitable vaccine candidates by identifying b-cell and t-cell epitopes 137 in the drug design the tanshinone iia and methyl tanshinonate were identified as natural inhibitors based on the docking score 138 in the vaccine design b-cell epitope vllplvssqcvnlttrtqlppaytn was found to have the highest antigenicity fvflvllpl of mhc class-i allele and fvflvllpl of mhc class-ii allele were identified as best peptides based on several alleles and antigenicity scores 139 therefore identifies natural inhibitors and putative antigenic epitopes might be useful as effective drug and vaccine candidates for the eradication of novel coronavirus structural proteins are important targets for vaccine and anti-viral drug development due to their indispensable function to fuse and enter into the host cell 140 sars-cov-2 utilizes glycosylated spike s protein to gain entry into host cells the s protein is a trimeric class i fusion protein and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane 141142 the s protein includes the receptor binding s1-subunit and the membrane fusion s2-subunit the s1 subunit receptor-binding domain rdb is specifically recognized by the host receptor when the s1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor the prefusion trimer is destabilized resulting in the shedding of the s1 subunit and the state transition of the s2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation 143 the critical function of the s protein can be a breakthrough in vaccine design and development great efforts are being made for the discovery of antiviral drugs but there are no licensed therapeutic or vaccine for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection available in the market developing an effective treatment for sars-cov-2 is therefore a research priority it is time-consuming and expensive to design novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies 144 thus choosing the method of immune-informatics is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens b- and t-cell linear epitope prediction and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens among those can be analyzed b-cell can recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection t-cell and antibody reactions may recover extreme respiratory infection fig 2
 the immune-informatics approaches to identify b- and t-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein s of sars-cov-2 followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen hla alleles was taken by li et al 145 four b cell epitopes two mhc class-i and nine mhc class-ii binding t-cell epitopes which showed highly antigenic features were identified allergenicity toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes the stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis no mutations were observed in all the selected b- and t-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development as described by li et al 145 as noted before covid-19 has become a global concern due to widespread outbreaks and lack of treatment therefore it is necessary to find and evaluate treatment methods more quickly in this case computer methods are very effective and helpful the predicted binding and ranking of drugs will also be useful to interpret the results of ongoing clinical trials that are testing existing drugs for effectiveness against covid-19 notwithstanding the limitations it has been described several diseases and traits which may be causally related to ace2 expression the lung which in turn may mediate susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection in addition the proteome-wide mr analysis revealed proteins that could lead to changes in ace2 expression subsequent drug repositioning analysis highlighted several candidates that may warrant further investigations we stress that most of the findings require replications and validation in further studies especially the part on drug repositioning nevertheless it is believed that this work is of value given the urgency to address the outbreak of sars-cov-2 this study was supported by 1013039501100004366tabriz university of medical sciences with grant number 65174 none to declare  reverse vaccinology approach to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine candidate against covid-19 an in silico study maryam enayatkhani mehdi hasaniazad sobhan faezi hamed guklani parivash davoodian nahid ahmadi mohammad einakian ali afsaneh karmostaji khadijeh ahmadi   coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak began in late december 2019 in wuhan the capital of hubei province china wang et al 2020 scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus known as 2019-ncov which is highly contagious and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease heymann 2020 huang et al 2020 coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses ssrna belonging to the coronaviridae family human coronaviruses hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold lim et al 2016 however recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics including sars severe acute respiratory syndrome mers middle east respiratory syndrome and covid-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family al-tawfiq et al 2014 so far the novel covid-19 has caused more than 700000 illnesses and more than 33000 deaths worldwide who 2020 the genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses structural proteins include s protein spike e protein envelope m protein membrane and n protein nucleocapsid ahmed et al 2020 the increasing rate of covid-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible there is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus therefore an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the covid-19 is required n protein is the only structural protein that associates with replicase-transcriptase complexes and binds with genomic rna in coronaviruses cong et al 2017 this protein is multifunctional and one of the most crucial structural components of coronaviruses n protein is a structural and antigenic protein that is involved in packaging transcription and replication coronaviruses 4 this data showed that n protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved antigenic and multifunctional 6 leung and et al concluded that n protein can be a suitable vaccine candidate against sars-cov because induce strong antibody and this process may trigger cytokine production leung et al 2004 coronaviruses m protein also has a key role in the assembly of virions the sars-cov m protein can interact with n protein and make a network of interactions with the genomic rna he et al 2004 ong and et al the covid-19 antigens such as s n and m proteins introduced as a vaccine candidate 6 this protein has also been studied as an epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov 7 open reading frame 3a orf3a is required for viral replication and virulence of sars cov severe induction of proinflammatory cytokine is a sign of sars-cov and mers-cov infections orf3a activates both pro-il-1 gene expression and il-1 secretion and leads to severe lung injury siu et al 2019 also orf3a has an important role in sars-cov assembly or budding with the participation of m and e proteins mcbride  fielding 2012 these proteins are not only involved in the pathogenesis of the covid-19 virus but also have high antigenicity chan et al 2020 siu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 in this study e m n orf10 orf8 orf3a and m proteins were evaluated by available bioinformatics tools for designing an efficient multi-epitope vaccine for the stimulation of immune responses against covid-19 infection since the covid-19 has been recently discovered little immunological information is available preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the covid-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the sars-cov 797 identify9 14 given the apparent similarity between the two viruses it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against sars-cov may be useful for developing a vaccine for covid-19 previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus deming et al 2007 yang et al 2004 studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection is relatively common in patients infected with this virus liu et al 2004 lin et al 2003 although these antibodies are effective they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients in addition to the specific humoral immunity it has been shown that the cd4 and cd8 responses provide long-lasting protection against covid-19 these studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections liu et al 2017 the concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble b and t-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production chemical stability and lack of infectious potential patronov  doytchinova 2013 the experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years these vaccines are mainly made up of b-cell cd8 cytolytic t-cell ctls and cd4 helper t-cells htls epitopes chiarella et al 2009 since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response testa  philip 2012 zheng et al 2017 during the development of a vaccine candidate against covid-19 complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation in the present study we aimed to design a novel multi-epitope fusion protein nucleocapsid orf3a and membrane protein or nom containing more efficient antigenic epitopes-rich domains the biological activity of the engineered fusion protein was assessed by bioinformatics tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptor tlr4 and cellular immune system receptor hla-a1101 we strongly believe that the outcome of the present report will provide a potential vaccine candidate against 2019-ncov at first the amino acid sequences of proteins were retrieved from the national centre for biotechnology information ncbi at wwwncbinlmnihgov in fasta format and performed for subsequent analysis table 1 we selected six proteins of covid-19 virus table 1 that have an essential role in virulence and replication of the virus and previous studies have highlighted the necessity of these proteins in coronaviruses function after the antigenic analysis of these proteins three proteins of n orf3a and m were selected for final analysis 1d sequence-based screening server

crystallographic structures of tlr4 pdb id 2z62 kim et al 2007 and hla-a1101 pdb id 5wjl culshaw et al 2017 were obtained from the pdb database berman et al 2000 the structures were cleaned and crystallographic waters and co-crystallized molecules were deleted and only the monomer forms of each receptor were kept then the structures of the two receptors and the nom protein were prepared by the dock prep tool in ucsf chimera software pettersen et al 2004 where hydrogen atoms and charge were added to the structures to make them ready for the next step in the next step to stabilize and relax the structures in an aqueous physiological environment each of the monomer form of the receptors and the nom protein were simulated for 100 ns the details of the md simulation will be explained later after the md simulation of each receptor and the nom recombinant protein the last frame of the trajectory of each simulation was extracted and used as the input structures for protein-protein molecular docking the patchdock webserver schneidman-duhovny et al 2005 with default parameters was used to predict the best positions and orientations where the two proteins can have the highest number of favorable interactions afterward the top 10 solutions were subjected to firedock webserver andrusier et al 2007 mashiach et al 2008 to refine the interaction of protein-protein complexes resulted from molecular docking the top two complexes from coronavirus nom protein-tlr4 and nom recombinant protein-hla-a1101 complexes were chosen based on global energies these four complexes were then taken to the next step md simulation after performing the protein-protein molecular docking and finding the best orientations of the vaccine candidate and the receptor proteins to interact with one another the two best-scored complexes were subjected to md simulation all of the md simulations were done by gromacs 2018 package abraham et al 2015 and opls-aa force field jorgensen et al 1996 the monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with tip3p water model jorgensen et al 1983 then sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mm each system was energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm until the fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kjmol1nm1 all of the covalent bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver lincs algorithm hess et al 1997 to maintain constant bond lengths the long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh ewald pme method darden et al 1993 essmann et al 1995 and the cut off radii for coulomb and van der waals short-range interactions were

system after the necessary equilibrations 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes finally simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions pbc set at xyz coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box and the subsequent analyses were then performed using gromacs utilities vmd humphrey et al 1996 and uscf chimera and also the plots and the figures were created using daniels xl toolbox v 732 add-in kraus 2014 and ezmol reynolds et al 2018 all of the computations were performed on an ubuntu desktop pc with a intelr xeonr

 the results of several studies have shown that strong virus-specific t-cell response is required for the elimination of respiratory virus infections such as sars-cov and influenza a and para-influenza these studies conclude that future vaccine interventions should also consider strategies to enhance t cell response to provide robust long-term memory channappanavar et al 2014 janice oh et al 2012 studies have shown that high levels of t cell responses against n protein were found 2 years after the patients recovery peng et al 2006 antibodies are essential to combat sars-cov infection and the body needs sars-cov specific cd4 t helper cells to produce these specific antibodies also cd8 cytotoxic t cells are important for recognizing and killing infected cells especially in the lungs of infected individuals we used the rankpep server which covers almost all hla supertypes to predicted different epitops from n orf3a and m proteins sequence according to hla i and hla ii alleles antigenic epitopes with high binding affinity score were predicted that are summarized in table 2ab successful vaccination against viruses such as measles and rubella reflects the importance of protective antibodies protection against virus infection such as coronaviruses depends on the simulation of neutralizing antibodies in addition to the t cell-mediated immunity while cytotoxic lymphocytes can kill infected cells antibodies have the potential to eliminate infected cells and prevent the infectious virus from infecting a cell neutralization sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies block viral entry drner  radbruch 2007 hsueh et al 2004 in this study for the linear epitope prediction the bepipred server was employed bepipred analysis revealed several continuous predicted epitopes of n orf3a and m proteins for cross-checking the predicted epitopes the sequence of all three proteins was also predicted by kolaskar  tongaonkar antigenicity the linear b-cell epitopes are represented in table 3 given that both cellular and humoral immune responses are essential against coronaviruses infection janice oh et al 2012 finally epitopes that were shared between b cell and t-cell were selected the main strategy in the present study was to design and construct a novel multi-epitope protein from covid-19 based on in silico methods to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses due to the low immunogenicity of the epitope we chose epitope-rich domains to generate a more diverse and robust response wieser et al 2010 based on in silico analysis five epitope-rich domains including highly scored and shared epitopes between t and b-cell epitopes were selected and joined to each other with a three aaa linker table 4 the schematic diagram of designed vaccine domains with linkers sites has been shown in figure 2 prediction of the vaccine candidate antigenicity represents a numerical criterion for the capability of the vaccine to bind to the b- and t-cell receptors and increase the immune response in the host cell vaxijen v20 was used to predict the antigenicity of the designed protein vaxijen analysis of nom protein showed potent antigenicity 05999 with a 04 threshold the results indicate that the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are antigenic allergen proteins induce an ige antibody response dimitrov et al 2013 the designed vaccine candidate must not show an allergic reaction to the body the allergenicity of the sequence was predicted using the allertop tool based on prediction approaches in allertop this protein was not recognized as an allergen primary structure analysis nom designed protein 337 aa has a molecular weight of 3751357 d the total number of positively charged residues arg  lys and negatively charged residues asp  glu were 19 and 32 respectively the theoretical isoelectric point pi was calculated at 962 the instability index  40 indicates that the designed protein has high stability for the initiation of an immunogenic reaction the instability index ii was 3575 which classifies the protein as stable the aliphatic index of nom recombinant protein was calculated 9792 and indicates this protein has stability in several temperatures natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helix are important forms of structural antigens that can be arranged in their native structure and thus identified by antibodies that are produced in response to infection shey et al 2019 the composition of the predicted secondary structure of the nom multi-epitope vaccine candidate was 4392 alpha helix 1602 extended strand and 4006 random coil all this information indicates the designed protein is suitable as a vaccine candidate three-dimensional structure was modeled by galaxyweb for our designed protein figure 3a this model was used for evaluation and refinement for validation of the model prosa-web ramachandran plot and molprobity were used that compare and analyze the protein structure the prosa web determined z-score for the best predicted 3 d model figure 3b the z-score of the nom predicted model was -442 which is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size the ramachandran plot indicates that most of the residues are found in the favored and allowed regions 997 and only 03 in the outlier region this shows that the quality of the designed model is satisfactory phe 282 asn311 tyr228 lys194 asp223 ser229 ser4 his197 tyr68 residues were observed in the allowed and outlier regions of ramachandran plot figure 3c in molprobity analysis the all-atom clash score was 937 the molprobity score was 221 all structural images were created using pymol the pymol molecular graphics system version 11 schrdinger llc ellipro server was used for predicting conformational b-cell epitopes from the 3 d structure of nom recombinant protein discontinuous b-cell epitopes were predicted with scores ranging from0679 to 0945 amino acid residues the number of residues sequence location as well as their scores have been listed in tables 5 the graphical representation of the discontinuous epitopes has been displayed in figure 4 a vaccine can interact with different receptors of the immune system we have docked designed final constructs nom with tlr4 and hla-a1101 receptors the interaction between these receptors and nom recombinant protein induce different immune responses to achieve a stable and relaxed state of the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors a md simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure these simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking after 100 ns of the production run as it is shown in figure 5 the rmsd root mean square distance values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of tlr4 pdb id 2z62 is very rigid and stable the structure of the nom recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change the backbone structure of the hla-a1101 pdb id 5wjl however showed big spikes in the rmsd values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project to find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the nom protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking we used patchdock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions afterward the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the firedock webserver to refine the docked structures the firedock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization the ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range long-range attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes we considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy as it is shown in table 6 the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the nom-tlr4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom-hla-a1101 complex were chosen for further calculations the total energy plots of the simulations are shown in figure 6 the results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors the interactions between the binding receptors and the docked nom protein were visualized using the ucsf chimera program residues of hla-a1101glu53 asn174 gly56 asn174 glu53 pro57 participated in the interaction with arg49 ser97 gln91 met102 arg49 and gln91 residues of the candidate vaccine also nine residues of tlr4 tlr4 lys123 ile319 thr66 ser90 lys124 lys46 his85 lys123 participated in the interaction with ser45 glu199 gln91 ala84 met328 gln65 ser90 glu68 residues of the designed candidate vaccine after the protein-protein molecular docking 4 solutions were chosen for md simulation solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom protein-hla-a1101 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from nom protein-tlr4 complex each was simulated for 100 ns to examine their stability throughout the simulations period the rmsd values of each protein was analyzed as it is shown in figure 7 each protein has different rmsd values and in some of them the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations the reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions the rmsd values of tlr4 in nom protein-tlr4 complexes and the values of hla-a1101 in nom protein-hla-a1101 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values however the rmsd values of the nom protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors however the interactions between the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and mmpbsa binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies as it is shown in table 7 the van der waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other moreover the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations in another word the higher scale of rmsd values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the nom protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors in addition to the analysis described above to analyze the fluctuations of the backbone atoms of structures of the proteins we decided to perform rmsf root mean square fluctuation analysis in this analysis the average value of fluctuation of each residue during the simulation is plotted figure 8 as it is shown in figure 8a the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms this is a direct indication that the nom recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors furthermore the rmsf values of the nom recombinant protein in complex with hla-a1101 are lower compared with that of nom recombinant protein in complex with tlr4 also with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower we can conclude that nom recombinant protein can bind to the hla-a1101 better than the other immune receptor in figure 8b and figure 8c the rmsf values of the monomer forms of the immune receptors show lower values compared to the complex forms this behavior is exactly the opposite of the nom designed protein this can be an indication that the structures are very stable in their natural function and their structures considerably change when they get into contact with the designed nom protein furthermore the structural illustration of the monomer forms and also the complex forms of the vaccine and the immune receptors figure 9 shows that the vaccine can fill the cavities and bind tightly to them as it was proved by the binding energies covid-19 pandemic is much more than a health crisis it leads to a political social and economic crisis in the world the development of a safe and effective vaccine could reduce the rate of this infection immunoinformatics methods are valuable in reducing time and cost in vaccine design and other fields of life sciences we have predicted and validated nom recombinant protein against hla-a1101 and tlr4 receptors our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and md simulations study the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a1101 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns higher binding energy even after the md simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity nom-tlr4 and nom- hla-a1101 interaction our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity given that b and t-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct taken all together according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses

mortality covid-19 are also currently in the research phase and there are 4 different strategies studied in the clinical stage those in phases 1 and 2 i inactivated or attenuated virus vaccines a classic method used for viral vaccines amanat and krammer 2020 chen et al 2020 ii nucleic acid vaccines dna and rna prepared using the nucleic acid information obtained by rapid sequencing of the entire genome of the virus mrna vaccine is the first vaccine to enter clinical phase1 safety trials ma et al 2020 saif 2020 iii subunit vaccines in which recombinant protein-based vaccines s protein is the first and main target are obtained using antigenic proteins of the virus using recombinant dna technologies and peptide-based vaccines are produced from the epitopes of antigenic proteins of virus lu 2020 saif 2020 iv viral-vector-based vaccines an alternative option using only s-1 region or receptor binding domain rbd to get rid of the problems caused by using all spike protein ahmed et al 2020 amanat and krammer 2020 ma et al 2020  although epitope-based peptide vaccines are known with their lower immunogenicities compared with other vaccine types which can be increased by utilization of adjuvants they have become an important subunit vaccine alternative owing to their versatility low production costs lower allergenic and reactogenic responses therefore developing an epitope-based peptide vaccine against sars-cov-2 along with other vaccine alternatives is of great importance in this review while the stages of detection development production and biological evaluation of peptides that can be used in vaccine formulations against covid-19 will be explained in detail the difficulties experienced in the development of epitope-based peptide vaccines and the advantages and disadvantages of these vaccines will also be discussed inactivated virus vaccines consist of virus particles produced in culture that have lost the ability to cause disease zhang et al 2020 the virus is killed by using heat uv irradiation or chemicals formaldehyde etc to reduce virulence so that a vaccine-induced infection can be prevented large-scale cultures of sars-cov-2 were created and inactivated viruses were obtained from these cultures by researchers via known methods zhang et al 2020  although inactivated virus vaccines have advantages such as safety easier preparation and inducing high-titer neutralizing antibodies it is an important disadvantage that they are potentially inappropriate for highly immunosuppressed patients roper and rehm 2009 shang et al 2020 additionally preparing the inactivated virus vaccine requires large quantities of infectious virus callaway 2020 recently sinovac biotech and their consortium have produced a vaccine candidate from purified inactivated sars-cov-2 viruses it was shown in the study that specific antibodies against the sars-cov-2 were detected in 3 different animals which had been immunized with the inactivated virus vaccine candidate gao et al 2020 attenuated vaccines are prepared by mutating the virus as a result of a serial treatment with human or animal cells in the laboratory to decrease its ability to cause disease one of the most important advantages of attenuated vaccines is that they offer more than one antigenic component to the host so it can induce various immunological effectors against the virus zhang et al 2020 it has been reported that many research institutionsuniversities such as the chinese centers for disease control and prevention wuhan institute of virology chinese academy of sciences zhejiang university codagenix inc and serum institute of india ltd are carrying out attenuated vaccine studies zhang et al 2020 for example codagenix continues its vaccine development studies against sars-cov-2 by using their own codon deoptimization technology subunit vaccines consisting of purified antigens have the advantages of easy production safety and the ability to induce both cellular and humoral immune response roper and rehm 2009 shang et al 2020 however subunit vaccines may require adjuvants immunostimulatory molecules delivered alongside the vaccine and multiple doses to increase their immunogenicity and protective activity callaway 2020 cov s proteins which have been shown in studies that have the ability to generate protective antibodies have been identified as favorite targets in subunit vaccine development against sars-cov enjuanes et al 1995 navas-martin and weiss 2003 in studies with similar subunit vaccines against sars-cov it is known that experimental animals are protected from infection although these vaccine candidates have not been tested in humans yet callaway 2020 similarly in various studies it has been accepted that s1 protein andor rbd element of sars-cov-2 should be considered the foremost antigen in vaccine development studies against covid-19 callaway 2020 lon et al 2020 rogers et al 2020 shang et al 2020 tang et al 2020 many research teams including biotechnology companies universities research centers etc are working on effective vaccines containing the viral protein subunits against covid-19 lon et al 2020 rogers et al 2020 tang et al 2020 viral vector vaccines are prepared by inserting the dna fragment of the highly infected virus into another harmless virus one of the advantages of this vaccine type is that it can induce high cellular and humoral immune responses shang et al 2020 it has also been reported that while viral vector vaccines can be safe similar to subunit vaccines the immunogenicity of viral vector vaccines can be highly analogous to live attenuated vaccines wu 2020  university of oxford and the us national institutes of health nih collaborators produced an adenovirus expressing the sars-cov-2 s protein van doremalen et al 2020 the study conducted in mice and rhesus macaques showed that this vaccine candidate induced immune response against sars-cov-2 additionally the vaccine efficiency study showed that the viral load decreased the lung of vaccinated animals had no signs of virus replication and no lung damage was observed in vaccinated animals compared to control van doremalen et al 2020  mrna vaccines which have been previously investigated for different diseases and had successful results are easier to design and translate into clinical trials ozkan 2020 roper and rehm 2009 shang et al 2020 although mrna vaccines have advantages such as easier design and inducing strong immune response it is an important disadvantage that they are extremely unstable under physiological conditions rauch et al 2018 moderna and a consortium consisting of fudan universityshanghai jiaotong universitybluebird biopharmaceutical company carry out their studies on mrna vaccines against covid-19 while modernas mrna vaccine encode s protein the consortium is working on two different mrna vaccines that express s protein and virus-like particles zhang et al 2020 apart from these it has been reported in the literature that various companiesuniversities and research centers are also working on mrna vaccines zhang et al 2020 in dna vaccines antigen or antigens are expressed by the plasmid dnas the difference from mrna vaccines is the coding of antigens with plasmid dna although they are more stable than mrna vaccines are easy to design and have the ability to form highly neutralized antibodies it has been reported that repeat doses of dna vaccine may cause toxicity rauch et al 2018  in the study of the usa and israel research teams dna-based vaccines have been developed to express s protein of sars-cov-2 in different forms yu et al 2020 in the study both humoral and cellular immune responses have been developed in the animals immunized with the dna vaccine additionally the virus challenge study showed that the vaccine encoding full-length s protein decreased the viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa was decreased in comparison with the control group yu et al 2020  as outlined above traditional vaccines against covid-19 include liveattenuatedinactivated sars-cov-2 however there are lots of disadvantages to the use of whole-organism vaccine especially in immunosuppressed patients if there is a presence of immunologically redundant biological components or biological impurities roper and rehm 2009 shang et al 2020 thus subunit vaccines have become widespread especially in research area due to their safety profiles and easier production although proteins are the main type of subunit vaccines peptides which are small fragments of proteins are also used as subunit vaccines callaway 2020 epitope-based peptide vaccines are used to overcome the problems of possible side effects related to heterogeneous and multicomponent vaccine and are considered an alternative to conventional vaccines peptides used in the vaccines are synthesized chemically using the amino acid sequences of the antigenic proteins of targeted pathogens these vaccines contain antigenic peptide epitopes with 2030 amino acids having high immunogenicity the recognition of the antigenic peptides by the immune system triggers the immune response by stimulating cytotoxic t cells or b cells or both simultaneously moisa and kolesanova 2012 although epitope-based peptide vaccines significantly limit allergenic or reactogenic complications low molecular weight and easy clearance from the body make the peptides lower immunogenic which can be overcome by using carriers or adjuvants in peptide vaccine formulations to increase their immunogenicity and decrease the dose moisa and kolesanova 2012 epitope-based peptide vaccines have many advantages over other vaccines it is easier and cheaper to produce peptides compared to traditional vaccines epitope-based peptide vaccines can be standardized and batch-to-batch differences can be very low since the structure of the peptide is very well-known structure-function relationships can be correlated much easier than the conventional vaccines also the structure of the peptide can easily be modified to obtain multiepitope or conjugated structures moisa and kolesanova 2012 sesardic 1993 the immune system is a large network that interacts with each other and contains thousands of molecular networks with the responses it creates tomar and de 2010 genomic sequencing clinical practice and large amounts of accumulated data generated by epidemiological data may cause confusion in order to use this large data more effectively by scientists it must be stored managed and analyzed bahrami et al 2019 this situation has brought immunology and computer sciences together and formed immunoinformatics pourseif et al 2019 tomar and de 2014  immunoinformatics is a new and important area with a large database that can create the most suitable options before the experimental stage bahrami et al 2019 immunoinformatics includes an in silico approach which is a more stable and less costly method in a shorter period of time to conventional laboratory techniques for development of vaccines ali et al 2017 khan et al 2019 the development of vaccines using conventional techniques entails high cost and a long period of 1015 years parvizpour et al 2020 with this approach specific regions are designed to prevent unwanted immune responses long-term immune responses to required responses and costtime effectiveness parvizpour et al 2020 the first step in the in silico-approached immunoinformatic epitope-based peptide studies is to identify the viruss antigen that stimulates antibodies and targets that are important for immunity kibria et al 2020 the structural proteins of spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n encoded by sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 genomes belonging to the betacoronavirus genus are suitable candidates for antigen selection ahmed et al 2020 since the b and t cell epitopes an immunogenic site of an antigen produce humoral and cellular immune responses these regions are predicted parvizpour et al 2020  different web-based tools are available for epitope design bui et al 2007 these tools provide user convenience by combining the methods developed for the determination of epitopes the kolaskar and tongaonkar method is a semiexperimental method that uses the physicochemical properties of amino acids and the experimentally determined data of these amino acids in the b cell epitope design kolaskar and tongaonkar 1990 the bepipred-20 server estimates b cell epitopes on only crystal structure derived data hence providing higher quality and strong prediction power jespersen et al 2017 basically the methods used in b cell epitope estimation is based on parameters such as the flexibility hydrophilicity polarity exposed surfaces antigenic propensity and accessibility of peptide chains vita et al 2019 the method used for t cell epitope prediction generally uses mhc class 1 binding tap transport efficiency and proteasal processing algorithms kibria et al 2020 vita et al 2019 t cell epitope prediction approach takes advantage of the cross-reactivity between hla class 2 regions and alleles to predict strong epitopes without being affected by hla polymorphism and ethnicity grifoni et al 2020 then population-based t epitope estimation is made and distribution of mhc alleles in a defined population is examined with this estimated population coverage the percentage of potential individuals who will be immune to the identified t cell epitope is revealed ahmed et al 2020 these epitopes are then transformed into 3d structure and docking analysis performed to show the interaction of the determined epitopes with different hlas oany et al 2014 another stage is the allergenicity test this step is vital for predicting the allergic reactions that may develop after giving the vaccine into the body oany et al 2014 epitope-based peptide vaccine candidates have been identified in many studies against mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 using all these in silico approaches although an approved vaccine is not available yet for mers-cov seen for the first time in 2012 yong et al 2019 protein-based studies at the preclinical level are quite high cho et al 2018 in these studies a large number of possible epitopes have been identified using in silico methods badawi et al 2016 ibrahim and kafi 2020 shi et al 2015 similarly a large number of vaccine development studies using in silico approach have also been conducted for sars-cov wang et al 2004 ying et al 2003 which emerged in 2003 and spread to 26 countries and with more than 8000 cases almofti et al reported that 3 b cell epitopes and 5 t cell epitopes which gave the best scores could be very good vaccine candidates determined by in silico-based epitope design study using ncbi and iedb tools almofti et al 2018 vaccine development studies has also been conducted rapidly against sars-cov-2 le et al 2020 as the covid-19 outbreak announced as a pandemic within the immunoinformatic approach many studies reported b and t cell epitopes and proposed as potential vaccine candidates for sars-cov-2 baruah and bose 2020 joshi et al 2020 kiyotani et al 2020 an in silico-based study conducted by kalita et al identified 33 nontoxic nonallergenic thermostable epitopes from 3 proteins kalita et al 2020 the stage of vaccine development studies initiated against covid-19 is given in detail in section 33 in the light of all these studies and data immunoinformatics offers strong candidates that could be used in new vaccine designs sobolev et al 2005 many different databases and pieces of software for vaccine design and validation parvizpour et al 2020 are now available for prediction of epitope-based peptides fast and accurate with possible strong immunity and minimal side effects parvizpour et al 2020 further in vitro and in vivo tests should be conducted on b and t cell epitope-based peptides predicted by in silico approaches following their synthesis  generally peptides can be chemically synthesized using two strategies solution- and solid-phase synthesis jensen et al 2013 the most useful and popular strategy is the solid-phase method named as merrifield solid-phase peptide synthesis spps developed by r b merrifield merrifield 1963  there are two main types of solid-phase peptide synthesis derived from the name of the n-terminal protecting groups of the amino acids that determine the chemistry method to be used boc and fmoc chemistry since removing the boc protecting group requires working with very strong acids such as hydrogen fluoride hf the fmoc chemistry is preferred spps with fmoc chemistry can be performed under less extreme conditions than boc chemistry and removing of the side protecting groups and cleaving of the peptide from the resin solid-phase can occur chan and white 1999 here the resin consisting of cross-linked polymeric beads has swelling property in solvents such as dmf and dcm and contains various linker groups on it that binds amino acids the c-terminal amino acid of the peptide binds to these resin beads the peptide is constructed with stepwise addition of amino acids at the n-terminus at the end of the synthesis the peptide is cleaved from the resin as the side chain protecting groups of amino acids are removed simultaneously stawikowski and fields 2012  the peptide needs to be characterized after its synthesis lc-esi-ms maldi-tof-ms and q-tof-ms methods are used extensively for molecular weight determination of the synthesized peptide lc-esi-ms and q-tof-ms systems are frequently used in routine as they also allow method validation determination of purity and method development for the purification procedure acar et al 2019 while ft-ir spectroscopy is used to determine the functional group characteristics of the peptide two- and three-dimensional structure of the peptide is illuminated by circular dichroism spectroscopy in addition measurement methods such as uv-vis fluorescence spectrometry are also used for further characterization ucar et al 2019  the peptide should then be separated from the impurities by proper purification techniques the reversed phase preparative hplc is the mostly used technique for purification of peptides ion exchange and affinity chromatography can also be used during purification of the special peptides after production ucar et al 2019 for the vaccine against covid-19 the studies in which antigenic peptides are chemically synthesized andor designed with in silico methods and showing possible antigenic activities are detailed below peptide epitope-based vaccine development studies are focused on s protein studies for the determination of the right peptide sequence for a vaccine against covid-19 are based on in silico studies synthesis and isolation of antigenic peptides in this part of the review information is given about peptide sequences that can be used against sars-cov-2 in a study by fast et al it was revealed that t cell and b cell epitopes identified in the study can be used in vaccine formulations against sars-cov-2 with higher immune responses and in detection of neutralizing antibodies fast and chen 2020 the study reported that the 494-506 sequence sygfqptngvgyq of s protein has the highest mhc presentation and is a b cell epitope it is stated that the data obtained from the study is important for identifying strong epitope-based vaccine candidates as well as its interaction with clinical results will provide information about the relationship between antigen presentation scores and vaccine efficacy fast and chen 2020  bojin et al identified a multi-epitope peptide vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 which could have the potential to stimulate t cell immune responses bojin et al 2020 short epitopes with the capacity to bind to multiple hla alleles were selected mhc class-i and mhc class-ii restricted epitopes were attached with a cathepsin-sensitive linker peptide llsvgg a long synthetic peptide sequence has been identified as syfiasfrlfartrsllsvggylqprtfll a0201 allele mhc-i epitop-cathepsin-sensitive linker-drb11101 allele to be used in vaccine candidates mhc-ii epitop bojin et al 2020  in a study by li et al interactions of sars-cov-2 with b- and t-cell epitopes and human hla alleles for surface glycoprotein were studied li et al 2020 it was indicated that the vgyqpyrvvvlsfel mhc-ii epitope peptide sequence had the highest antigenicity score in another investigation that examined antigenic peptide sequences of sars-cov-2 with multiple epitope structure proteins of s e and m were studied feng et al 2020 while 25 sequences of s protein are recommended 2 sequences have been determined for m and e proteins of all these peptide sequences the 1216-1245 sequence iwlgfiagliaivmvtimlckkkkkkkkk of s protein gave higher hla scores than others and was proposed as a candidate antigen for use in vaccine formulations feng et al 2020  zhang et al have prepared sbp1 peptide-based linker with 23 amino acids using molecular dynamic md simulations in their study zhang et al 2020 the human protein derivative sbp1 sequence is completely proteinogenic and is not considered to have an immunogenic effect it is seen that s protein is targeted in most of the drug and vaccine development studies against sars-cov-2 the s protein consists of two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 has an rbd that interacts with the receptor of host cell ace2 this peptide linker is thought to inhibit the interaction between s protein of sars-cov-2 and ace2 prevent virus entry into human cells and play an important role in diagnosis and treatment of sars-cov-2 zhang et al 2020  pant et al have published a study providing comprehensive research of main residues and ligand-receptor interactions for the improvement of peptide-like molecules as covid-19 essential protease inhibitors pant et al 2020 they reported that four small molecules selected from 300 peptide-like molecules found in various databases with docking studies and md simulations show powerful binding affinity with residues within the binding position and should be evaluated against sars-cov-2 pant et al 2020  in one study the authors presented in silico description of an exhaustive list of antigenic peptides that could potentially be used to develop vaccines against the new coronavirus 2019 lee and koohy 2020 they conducted de novo investigation of peptides with 9 amino acids from sars-cov-2 binding to hla alleles in the european and chinese populations also the peptides had tcr recognition potential determined by the immunogenicity algorithm of ipred developed recently lee and koohy 2020  the itlcftlkr epitope was chosen depending on its good antigenicity to prepare and design a vaccine against covid-19 joshi et al 2020 it was reported that this particular epitope can actively bind to mhc hla-alleles and covers the maximum population for various geographic districts however it was indicated that the use of this particular peptide epitope in the design of vaccines against sars-cov-2 requires wet laboratory validation  peptides having more than one epitope can be designed and used in the vaccines targeting the s protein in a study conducted by bhattacharya et al thirty-three linear b cell epitopes have been determined from the s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 bhattacharya et al 2020 the sequences were then analyzed to determine the t cell epitope that can be combined with mhc-i and ii the selected 16 epitopes were transformed into a single sequence with eaaak3 linkers then the peptide-based vaccine composition was designed and the model was confirmed to be of good quality molecular docking between the designed multiepitope peptide and tlr-5 exhibited a significant binding affinity this proves the importance of designing multiepitope peptides to develop effective vaccine candidates against covid-19 these epitopes are ideal candidates for formulating a multiepitope peptide vaccine when in vitro and in vivo validation is performed owing to their b-cell epitope containing sequences and verified antigenicities bhattacharya et al 2020 on the other hand abdelmageed et al suggested that it can be generated a strong and long-term immune response against the covid-19 by cd8 t cell to produce an immunogenic peptide vaccine abdelmageed et al 2020 therefore they studied t cell epitope-based peptide vaccine modeling instead of b cell by targeting e protein in mhc-i for the peptide vaccine the following 10 peptide sequences yvysrvknl slvkpsfyv svllflafv flafvvfll vllflafvv rlcayccni fvseetgtl ltalrlcay lvkpsfyvy and nivnvslvk were

llvtlailtalrlca sfyvysrvknlnssr lvtlailtalrlcay vtlailtalrlcayc and cnivnvslvkpsfyv were also selected as vaccine candidates according to the world population coverage 9999 the research group which aims to find the protected coding genes necessary for the survival of the virus suggested that unique genes can be used as a potential drug and vaccine target due to their large mutations that enable the virus to show high resistance to antibiotics protein e has been identified as the most antigenic gene and its protection against 7 coronavirus strains has been tested validated and multiple sequence alignment was done msa abdelmageed et al 2020 as a result of another detailed study conducted with a computer-aided vaccine design cavd approach to develop a series of epitope-based peptide vaccine candidates 4 possible peptides were presented peldsfkeeldkyfknhtspdvdlgdisgin 1143-1173 fsqilpdpskpskrsfi 802-818 tmslgaensvaysnns 696-711 and nsnnldskvggnyn 437-450 biswas et al 2020 researchers stated that if the peptide sequences are supported by wet laboratory studies they may be candidates in developing vaccines against covid-19  grifoni et al in their study emphasized that understanding of sars-cov-2 proteins and epitopes recognized through human cd4 and cd8 t cells responses are important in developing vaccines because it will allow monitoring measuring and understanding immune responses against covid-19 infection grifoni et al 1920 it was stated that this information would assist candidate vaccine modeling and facilitate the assessment of vaccine immunogenicity using the peptide megapooller prescribed by hla class i and ii the research group detected cd8 and cd4 t cells specific to sars-cov-2 in the blood samples of 70100 of healing covid-19 patients according to the results 15-mer peptides were synthesized to investigate spike-specific cd4 t cells using multiple experimental approaches cd4 and cd8 t cell and antibody responses specific to sars-cov-2 were observed through all covid-19 cases besides sars-cov-2-cross-reactive t cell responses were observed in healthy donors demonstrating some potential for preexisting immunity in the human population grifoni et al 1920 alum has been the most commonly used adjuvant in vaccines since their discovery in by glenny et al 1926 and classified in branch of vehicles of adjuvants in the literature alum is generally used to name aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate gels as adjuvant in the study by tseng et al 2012 alum was used as the adjuvant in four different vaccine formulations against sars-cov in which two of them are whole virus vaccines one of them is recombinant s protein vaccine and the last one is virus-like particle these vaccine formulations were examined with and without alum as the adjuvant as mentioned in the study almost all formulations protected the mice against the virus but th2-type immunopathology and hypersensitivity was observed in response to the formulations no direct relationship could be established between alum usage as the adjuvant and hypersensitivity jaume et al developed a subunit vaccine formulation against sars-cov using recombinant s protein with and without alum as the adjuvant kam et al 2007 they investigated immunogenicity of the vaccine and antibody-dependent enhancement ade on hamster in their study in which viral load in hamsters at 3 days postchallenge decreased by at least four orders of magnitude without signs of enhanced lung pathology unfortunately alum cannot induce th1 immune response effectively which is significant in vaccines against viruses petrovsky and aguilar 2004 in a novel study aluminum nanoparticles were used as antigen delivery vehicles adjuvants to deliver ovalbumin as the model subunit antigen through pulmonary administration which is not suitable for conventional alum wang et al 2020 it was shown that aluminum nanoparticles can induce both th1 and th2 responses safely and were effective against air-borne pathogens like mers or sars-cov-2 because of the pulmonary administration of the vaccine formulation  in ongoing studies against sars-cov-2 glaxosmithkline is using the adjuvants of as03 in their cooperative study with clover biotechnology for developing s protein based subunit vaccine veugelers and zachmann 2020 as03 is an oil-in-water emulsion-based and vehicle type adjuvant that contains squalene and alpha-tocopherol reed et al 2009 usage of this adjuvant induces both th1 and th2 cytokine responses and higher antibody titer compared with alum as shown in the vaccine study against hepatitis b morel et al 2011 khurana et al studied s protein-based vaccines against sars-cov-2 to evaluate induced antibody titers ravichandran et al 2020 they used emulsigen as the adjuvant in their vaccine formulations emulsigen is another oil-in-water emulsion-based adjuvant system the study revealed that more antibody titers were obtained against receptor binding domain and s1 protein than the s2 domain mpla and cpg were used as adjuvants in a liposomal vaccine formulation against sars-cov-2 that contains s protein as the antigen lixin et al 2020 while both cpg and mpla monophosphoryl lipid a are immunostimulant type adjuvants cpg has a nucleic acid-based structure and mpla is a lipid the adjuvant system in the study induced a humoral and cd8 and cd4 t-cell responses against s protein of sars-cov-2 the company of novavax is also developing a subunit vaccine against sars-cov-2 using antigenic proteins of the virus veugelers and zachmann 2020 the company uses their commercial adjuvant of matrix-m in the vaccine to increase and modulate the immune response it is known from previous studies that matrix-m is a nanoparticle that is formed from quillaja saponins with cholesterol and phospholipids and preferentially induces th1 immune response against the antigenic molecules magnusson et al 2018 zhao et al compared the immune responses obtained from three different adjuvants used in peptide vaccines against sars-cov zhao et al 2011 in the study cpg odn polyic polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid and r848 were examined as immunostimulant adjuvants cpg odn had better immune response than the others owing to induction of il-12 by cpg also the authors noticed that these three adjuvants not only induce the cellular immune response but also induce humoral immune response against the virus by using the peptides as the antigens  cyclic guanosine monophosphateadenosine monophosphate cgamp was also proposed to be used as adjuvant in sars-cov-2 vaccine in the form of ps-gamp pulmonary surfactant gamp ma et al 2020 this adjuvant can be a good universal mucosal adjuvant to develop a vaccine against a wide range of viruses owing to its broad-spectrum cross protection not only against h1n1 but also against h3n2 h5n1 and h7n9 viruses matsui et al examined a different strategy by attaching the synthetic antigenic peptides of sars-cov onto the surface of liposomes to induce immune response against the virus ohno et al 2009 liposomes are a kind of vehicle or delivery type of adjuvants in the study one of the formulations of antigenic peptide coated liposomes exhibited protection in viral challenge  there are several on-going subunit vaccine studies that use adjuvants to induce the immune response and as mentioned adjuvant type can cause different forms of immune responses against the antigens and pathogen therefore it is important to notice that proper adjuvant selection becomes vital especially in sars-cov-2 vaccines to prevent immunopathology and ade  in order to design and develop the appropriate and effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 the pathogenesis of the infection must be known well before the vaccine development study coronaviruses bind to the cell membrane by using the s protein which is very spiky shaped to infect a cell callaway 2020 rogers et al 2020 shang et al 2020 similar to sars-cov the sars-cov-2 binds the ace2 receptor on the cell surface for infection in humans lon et al 2020 rogers et al 2020 tang et al 2020 during cov infection in humans the entry of double chain viral rna occurs inside the double membrane vesicles antigen-presenting cells apc as an antiviral mechanism act in the antigenic peptide presentation in complexes with mhc-i and mhc-ii to cd4 and cd8 t cells and one of the most important cells is dendritic cells dc kumar et al 2020 as with any viral infection dendritic cells dc present in the respiratory system play an important role as antigen presenting cells apc during sars infection antigen presentation in sars-cov is importantly done with mhc-i and then mhc-ii and they are also investigated for epitope mapping used generally for vaccine development in the studies it has been identified that approximately 405 t cell peptide epitopes have a high affinity against mhc-i and mhc-ii and also two different b cell epitopes which are strong neutralizing were found for the s protein kumar et al 2020 cellular immune response occurs in infected cells through t-lymphocytes as a mechanism of adaptive immunity while t helper cells are active in the general adaptive immune response tc cytotoxic t cells are responsible for the clearance of the virus-infected cells it has been demonstrated that cd4 tnfa il-2 and ifn and cd8 tnfa ifn memory t cells can function by replicating the ifn-producing t cell however in recent reports on sars-cov-2 it was suggested that an effective reduction in the number of cd8 and cd4 t cells of pbmcs peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infected individuals can be obtained which also can lead to impaired t memory cell formation and progression in the recovered sars-cov-2 patients kumar et al 2020 the antibody-mediated humoral immune mechanism occurs through the differentiation of b lymphocytes into plasma cells through t helper cells and the production of neutralizing antibodies specific for viral antigen kumar et al 2020 the relevant virus-specific antibodies produced by b lymphocytes to limit sars-cov-2 infection are effective in preventing the entry of the virus to host cells thus the specific antibodies prevent the transmission and recurrence of the infection by providing protection against the disease sars-cov-2 s proteins have b cell epitopes as receptor binding domains rbd to produce neutralizing antibodies current evidence suggests that the th1-type response is important in controlling sars-cov and this probably also applies to sars-cov-2 kumar et al 2020 in the literature review it was found that in cases that result in death after sars-cov-2 infection th2 increases the pathogenesis of the virus with increased immune response huang et al 2020 zhou and zhao 2020 similarly it has been concluded in many studies that the triggering of the th1 immune response plays a key role in a suitable vaccine model to be developed against the viral infections channappanavar et al 2014 huang et al 2020 thiel and weber 2008 zhou and zhao 2020 ifn mediated antiviral immune responses play a stronger cytokine role for control of sars-cov-2 infections it has stated that low or delayed induction of ifn by the virus causes activation of macrophage and proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs activation of immune system components cytokines or macrophages causes vascular leakage as well as disrupting adaptive immune response kumar et al 2020 in conclusion it is vital to develop a vaccine against covid-19 to prevent the disease and limit the outbreak which has become a global disaster in 2020 many different strategies are being examined to develop potential vaccines against the disease among these vaccines the peptide-based vaccine strategies against sars-cov-2 have been mentioned in this review epitope-based peptide vaccines ascend among all the vaccines depending on their low costs easier production and safety however there are some challenges to be overcome in developing an epitope-based peptide vaccine against sars-cov-2 although in silico methods can predict the antigenic epitopes with high accuracy it is probable that cell and animal studies may reveal low immunogenicity of the sequence therefore a comprehensive study should be accomplished to predict the antigenic peptide sequence against the pathogen also possible mutations in antigenic epitopes should be followed to keep the activity of vaccine formulation in the following batches of production low immunogenicity of the peptides compared to other vaccine types is the most significant drawback which is overcome by using adjuvants in formulation proper selection of the adjuvant is essential in epitope-based peptide vaccines against sars-cov-2 to obtain a balanced th1th2 immune response which will prevent immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement in conclusion it is evident that the epitope-based peptide vaccines have a great potential and should have a place in the competition for rapid development of a protective vaccine against sars-cov-2 mt esa tar dt-b sd were responsible for the concept design and critical review of manuscript

research gaurav chauhan marc madou j sourav kalra vianni chopra deepa ghosh sergio martinez-chapa o   sars-cov-2 has a single-stranded rna genome of approximately 34 kilobases and a
nucleocapsid of helical symmetry the sars-cov-2 genome is 80 identical to
the sars-cov and 96 to the batcov ratg1310 the
integrity of the sars-cov particle is maintained by four proteins i the s
protein spike glycoprotein that enables the attachment of the virus to
host cells followed by membrane fusion hence promoting the entry of
sars-cov into the host cells ii the abundant m protein membrane that
maintains the membrane integrity of the viral particle iii the e protein
envelope is the smallest protein and plays a structural role and helps in
assembly and budding and iv the n protein nucleocapsid predominantly
binds to the sars-cov rna and supports nucleocapsid
formation2127
the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the key receptor for entry of
sars-cov-2 in the cells of the host cellular proteases human airway
trypsin-like protease and cathepsins and transmembrane protease serine 2
tmprss2 control the viral entry mechanism by splitting the spike protein
and initiating further penetration mechanisms28 at least
six open reading frames are present in a typical cov genome that encode for
the production of subgenomic rnas 16 nonstructural proteins nsps and
structural proteins spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid
protein2931 the life cycle of sars-cov-2 explaining the entire
pathophysiology mechanism is detailed in figure 1 i coronavirus s proteins promote the entry of the virus into host cells and are
the area of focus for various antibodies the surface s protein spike
glycoprotein of virions is the site for recognition and membrane
fusion3234 the s protein a trimer gets cleaved into s1 and s2
subunits the s1 subunits contain the receptor binding domain rbd and are
released in post-transfusion conformation3437 s1 directly binds to the peptidase domain pd of
the ace2 while s2 subunits help in the membrane fusion that is critical for
viral infection3839 s2 contains cleavage sites and is sliced by host
proteases354041 ace2 is a dimer of the two units and accommodates the rbd in its peptidase
domain the contact between the ace2 and sars-cov-2 is facilitated by polar
interactions373842 an
arch-shaped helix of the peptidase domain of ace2 interacts with the loop
region of the rbd of the s protein figure 1 ii the other helix and loops connect the antiparallel
strands and coordinate the peptidase domain to the rbd the amino acid
interactions that are observed in rbd of sars-cov-2 and the peptidase domain
of ace2 are considered important aspects for the inhibitor design43 it was observed that the amino acid gln498 of sars-cov-2
interacts with ace2 at the asp38 tyr41 gln42 leu45 and lys353 amino
acids while leu455 of the virus has interaction with asp30 lys31 and
his34 more interactions include the sars-cov-2 phe486 with gln24 leu79
met82 tyr83 and leu472 gln493 showed interaction with ace2 lys31 and
his34 and forms an h-bond with glu35 the amino acid asn501 has a similar
type of interaction with ace2 lys353 gly354 and asp355 while h-bond
interaction is observed with tyr4144 the binding
affinity of the rbd domain of sars-cov-2 and pd of ace2 is higher when
compared to sars-cov43 it was reported that in
sars-cov-2 the amino acid lys417 showed a salt bridge interaction with asp30
of ace2 the positive charged patch contributed toward the electrostatic
potential on the surface of rbd that is added by lys417 in sars-cov-2 and
absent in sars-cov434546 examination of the sars-cov-2 virion architecture using tem reveals a roughly
spherical or moderately pleiomorphic morphology the virion diameter is
observed to have a broad distribution of 80160 nm and a condensed
mass of nucleic acid and nucleocapsid protein underneath a well-defined
lipid bilayer envelop47 tem also reveals the nail-like
shape of the sars-cov-2 spikes with a 7 nm wide head and a 23 nm long body
after the dissociation of the s1 subunit from the s protein a
conformational change was observed in the s2 subunit this change from a
compressed form to a nail-like shape was confirmed by different researchers
and is called a postfusion state a three-dimensional 3d map and
two-dimensional projection images of s2 protein at the postfusion state were
provided by song et al with negative staining em37 it was also confirmed from biophysical assays and
cryo-em structure analysis that sars-cov-2 s protein binds at least 10 times
more tightly to ace2 host cell receptors when compared to the spike protein
of sars-cov394348 both innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated by the sars-cov-2
infection humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are further reported
to play a protective role against the infection whereas inflammation and
dysfunctional immune responses result in both local and systemic tissue
damage4952
pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps recognition triggers the
innate immune response further activating signaling pathways and nuclear
translocation of transcription factors like nuclear factor b
nf-b interferon response factors irf3 and irf7 and activator
protein 1 ap-15354 these transcription factors further result in the
initiation of tumor necrosis factors tnf chemokine-dependent inflammatory
responses through nf-b and ap-1 stimulated expression and type-i
interferon ifn- and -dependent antiviral innate immune
responses to suppress the viral infection5556 on the other hand
adaptive immune responses are specific for the virus or cells infected with
the virus and become noticeable after 1 week of the disease onset the
protective role of humoral b-cell immune response is primarily delivered
by antibody secretion to neutralize the sars-cov-2 virus after specifically
blocking the virushost interaction4657 t cell response against
viral infection is significant for the direct killing of the infected cells
by cd8 t cells whereas cd4 t cells help in
cytokine production and priming of b cells and cd8 t
cells5860 lisa and co-workers presented a chronological
description of various events happening during sars-cov-2 infection figure 261 sars-cov-2 primarily affects the respiratory system first and then spreads
systemically to the heart liver and kidneys62 although
it is still uncertain whether the viral infection directly results in organ
or tissue injury as observed in covid-19 patients it is important to
mention that ace2 is highly expressed in the respiratory tract and other
organs and tissues encompassing the cardiovascular system cvs cns git
and female reproductive systems6364 in the pulmonary system there is a
high expression of ace2 in lung and bronchial branches cells and it serves
as the primary entry site and binding site for sars-cov-265 this higher ace2 expression makes the alveolar
epithelial cells more accessible for sars-cov-2 and is clinically portrayed
by the rapid development of pneumonia advancing to the acute respiratory
distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure in severe cases10 in the cvs cells heart endothelial cells
etc are known to show a high expression of ace2
which acts to regulate blood pressure and myocardial contractility66 sars-cov-2 binding to ace2 may result in the activation
and upregulation of ace2 downstream signal transduction pathways this
includes the activation of the ras-erk-ap-1 pathway which further may
activate the cc motif chemokine ligand 2 ccl2 which is a
pro-fibrosis factor resulting in the development of cardiac inflammation
and fibrosis67 an increase in the levels of myocardial
markers specific like hs-ctni and nonspecific creatine kinase creatine
kinase mb isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase has been reported in
patients and can act as important tools for determining the level of cov-2
progression to the heart as well as other vital organs68
in the cns cov-2 can infect the cns in four different ways i direct
infection injury this involves a the blood circulatory pathway the virus
passes through the increased permeability of bloodbrain barrier
bbb due to a cytokine storm b neuronal pathway sensory nerve endings
are the major target for viral infection which may result in anterograde or
retrograde axonal transport by motor kinesins and dyneins69 ii hypoxia injury a result of virus infection of lung
tissues exudative inflammation both in the alveolar and interstitial
region pulmonary edema and related disorders an increase in alveolar gas
exchange disorders causes hypoxia in the cns leading to increased anaerobic
metabolism in the mitochondria of brain cells this hypoxia leads to cns
hypertension headaches edema drowsiness swelling of olfactory bulbs
loss of taste and can cause severe damage to cns70
iii immune system the infection of macrophages microglia and astrocytes
can activate the immune cells in the brain and the consequent cytokine
storm can result in severe brain damage71 iv ace2
sars-cov-2 interaction with the ace2 expressed in the capillary endothelium
may damage the bbb and facilitate the virus entry by attacking the vascular
system72 git the high expression of ace2 and
tmprss2 in intestinal epithelial cells including each organ duodenum small
intestine pancreas and liver of the gastrointestinal tract makes these
cells and organs potential targets of cov-2 a recent study by xiao f
et al detected viral rna and nucleocapsid protein in
gastric duodenal and rectal epithelia73 reproductive
system ace2 is also highly expressed in reproductive organs especially in
placenta uterus and fetal interface of pregnant women in order to
counteract preeclampsia the presence of ace2 in fetal tissue can also
provide target sites for cov-2 binding causing further morbidity and
mortality7475 therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to deal with existing and
potentially upcoming coronavirus infections are under development the
symptomatic treatment approach is presently followed in the absence of
an exclusive antiviral treatment against sars-cov-2 artificial
intelligence and other computation tools are currently in use to
assist the lengthy process of drug discovery and development against
this new pathogen7678 using recently available genetic information
and protein structure modeling several therapeutic strategies based
on drug repurposing are projected for the immediate treatment of
infected patients7982 target identification to halt the pathogenesis
of the viral infection holds the key in this development viral
protease 3clpro and plpro host cell produced protease tmprss2
rna polymerase rdrp and the interaction site of viral s protein
with host receptor ace2 are among the major targets identified for
repurposing already existing antiviral molecules and new small
molecules under development figure 38390 targeting the sars-cov-2 surface s protein using neutralizing antibody
nabs is another strategy proposed469495 the close similarity of sars-cov-2 with
sars-cov allows for researchers to explore the cross-neutralizing
activity of nabs developed for sars-cov against sars-cov-2
infection9699 the approach is mostly
directed at utilizing currently available genomic information to
synthesize immunogenic segments against s protein including its
rbd96111 several traditional and advanced lead
screening and labanimal testing methods are considered to speed up
this usually slow and challenging process it is also suggested that a
combination of nabs may be required to guarantee prophylaxis112 some other targets that are considered for
neutralizing antibody development are based on the information allied
to the already known sars and mers infections38
these targets include il-6il-6r cd16 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motif itam toll-like receptor 3 tlr3 dendritic
cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin
dc-sign interferon -inducible protein 10 ip-10cxcl10
intercellular adhesion molecule 3 icam-3 and monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 mcp151113114 cytokine therapy comprising of chemokines
interferons and others is also proposed owing to its potential to
halt viral replication and thus its use in treating sars
infections114115 some examples include
recombinant interferon rsifn-co recombinant human interferon
inf- rhifn- polymer conjugate cysteine variants
metil-29c172s-peg long-lasting interferon fused with human serum
albumin-binding peptide hsa-ifn and pegylated ifn-1116 interferon-2b treatment in covid-19
patients resulted in the shortened duration of viral shedding
particularly the reduction of markers of acute inflammation such
c-reactive protein and il6117 targeting the sars-cov-2 viral rna genome using rna interference rnai
or antisense oligonucleotides is another interesting approach to
consider118 designing a small complementary
rna sequence to target and neutralize sars-cov-2 rna is challenging
because of the unidentified conserved rna sequence domains for this
virus it is reported that rnai such as small interfering rnas
sirnas rna aptamers and antisense oligonucleotides might find use
in treating the sars infection119120 further within
sirna therapy different regions are described as targets to halt the
infection sirna-m1 and m2 were designed to precisely target regions
of the sars protein m mrna with an interference efficiency of 70
patent application cn101173275 similarly it was disclosed that a
series of sirnas were revealed to target and impede the expression of
sars-cov m n and e genes other sirna targets reported include rna
polymerase and replicase regions of coronavirus inhibiting its
infection and replication antisense oligonucleotides and rna aptamers
are also reported to target the pseudoknot structure and unwinding of
the sars cov rna respectively114 the covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted human lives and desperate
efforts are being employed across the world to develop safe and
effective vaccines the first vaccine candidate has already made it to
human clinical trials as a result of fast-tracked development
strategies and advanced vaccine technological platforms121 similar to what was explained earlier for
therapeutic development the significant genomic match of sars-cov-2
with other coronaviruses is helping the vaccine developers to
facilitate designs toward the most promising vaccine candidates the
target strategy for most of the vaccine candidates is to induce nabs
against the viral s protein averting the ace2-mediated host uptake
in the case of sars-cov vaccine development higher nabs titers and
better protection were reported with s protein subunit vaccines when
compared to any other target strategy sarsmers vaccine development
research suggests s protein subunits rbd of the s1 subunit and s
proteingene as the most preferred target sites122124 but still knowledge of sars-cov-2 specific
antigens for under trial vaccine candidates is limited the
development of covid-19 vaccine candidates is relying on several
high-tech platforms including attenuated and inactivated viruses
replicating and nonreplicating viral vectors dna and mrna virus-like
particles and recombinant protein-based approaches some platforms
offer key advantages such as viral vectors with their strong immune
response superior protein expression and prolonged stability and
dna or mrna offers antigen manipulation flexibility whereas the
recombinant protein-based development approach is easier to scale up
using existing production capabilities in table
1 we list some of the most
advanced covid-19 vaccine candidates that have recently moved into
clinical development125126 enhancing the immunogenicity
using vaccine adjuvants is also under consideration to lower the
viable dose and to widen the therapeutic and safety
window127128 compromised immune systems
and high risk of disease in the elderly population also demand
adjuvant strategies to improve efficacy of vaccines in this age
group129 some licensed adjuvants developed
specifically for covid-19 vaccine are as03 glaxosmithkine mf59
seqirus and cpg 1018 dynavax the covid-19 crisis also demands an urgent analysis of all the available
nanotechnology tools while nanomedicine strategies are in use for the
design of the vaccine carriers there are not enough other
nanotechnology approaches being explored to tackle the current
outbreak this manuscript attempts to systematically present the
current status of nanotechnology use in therapeutics and vaccine
development therapeutic development and challenges against sars-cov-2
infection are not so different from other infectious diseases as well
as oncology research130 similarly the vaccine
development holds significant commonalities with strategies explored
against previously known sars mers
coronaviruses121131 hence it is worth
revisiting these closely related therapeuticvaccine strategies and
associated nanotechnology use and this way our aim is to design
repurposed nanotechnology to fast-track the current
research figure 4 nanocarrier-based therapeutics offers several opportunities to address
the limitations of current antiviral therapy some basic challenges
such as poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability can be solved
by nanocarrier-based antiviral drugs delivery modifying its
pharmacokineticspharmacodynamics properties and resulting in dose
reduction reduced toxicity and improved drug bioavailability and
maintenance of the suppression of viral spread despite viral
suppression in the plasma another kind of challenge is the presence
of subtherapeutic concentrations of an antiviral drug in reserve
sites132133 active targeted nanocarriers
offer the opportunity to cross biological barriers and attain
therapeutic concentrations in sheltered viral reservoirs134 it is further possible to target a specific organ
and cellular and intercellular sites involved in the pathophysiology
of sars-cov-2 possibly ace2 expressing cells domains of viral s
protein cathepsin binding sites etc
controlledsustained drug-releasing nanocarriers are the best solution
to mitigate the risk effects of poor patient compliance and viral
rebound during the treatment of viral infections a nanomedicine
strategy is thus a powerful tool to transform the antivirals
repurposing and improving the covid-19 therapeutic management135 the role of nanocarrier technologies is decisive in the development of
rnai nabs protein peptide and other biologicals136 an important prerequisite with such drug
candidates is the protection against degradation
loss-of-function in systemic circulation and
intracellular delivery systemic toxicityimmunotoxicity is another
big issue more specifically with protein and peptide-based drugs
nanocarrier-based delivery including biologic prodrug ensures
improved half-life of the biologicals by preventing premature drug
release and degradation along with evasion of renal and hepatic
clearance137 engineered nanocarriers offer
stealth characteristics to evade immune recognition and better
cellular uptake targeted nanoparticles provide an improved rate of
endocytosis which better ensures delivery of a therapeutic
nanoparticle dose to the target cell ability to carry a higher drug
load entails the delivery of fewer nanoparticles and is further
supported with a controlled drug release within the cells ensuring
reduced side effects138143 a broad range of active moieties including antivirals biologics and
nucleic acids can be loaded and delivered by nanocarriers connecting
the right therapeutic candidate to the right nanocarrier aimed for a
specific disease condition is crucial for the commercial success of
nanomedicine against the sars-cov-2 virus this nanomedicine approach
needs to deal with reformulating approved as well as under trial drug
candidates to improve the therapeutic index ti
predominantly by addressing the limitations associated with the drug
molecule and mitigating the conventional toxicity or side effects
therapeutic developments proposed for covid-19 treatment possess a
basic similarity with oncology research hence the currently
available nanomedicine platforms for anticancer therapeutics should be
considered in order to nurture this approach144145
better mechanistic understanding of drug-specific side effects is the
first step in this development process the
second step in this process is to scrutinize and
select a very basic nanostrategy to maximize the impact of
nanomedicine on the drugs ti nanodelivery of biologics also
requires smart nanocarrier designs embracing strategies like the
prodrug approach146147 a rational development and
clinical translation of nanomedicine will require several strategic
track developments fast paced and slower paced ones tackling the
right translational challenge and fostering more nanomedicine
research148 strategic guidelines proposed
for the development of anticancerantiviral nanomedicines are of high
importance emphasizing the right areas and precise tools to
fast-track the covid-19 nanomedicine research for example relatively safe antibody-drug conjugates of highly toxic
auristatins are approved for the treatment of hematological cancers a
major limitation for use of these conjugates is the very low tolerable
drug payloads in order to solve this problem polymeric nanoparticles
were developed with a high auristatin payload to achieve efficient and
safe tumor suppression149 similarly formulating
polyethylene glycol-polylactide-based nanoparticles loaded with
aurora b kinase inhibitor revealed increased efficacy and reduced
toxicity as compared to its free form which produced intolerable side
effects in phase ii clinical trials150 a
well-known limitation of nucleic acid
eg rnai drug candidates
is their systemic circulation instability and the prerequisite of
their intracellular delivery151153 lipid
nanoparticles lnps carrying sirna are an example of a nanotechnology
platform onpattro used to prevent this systemic degradation along
with the benefit of liver-targeting154
lipid-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles used to deliver a highly
hydrophilic and unstable antiviral molecule ml336 chemical inhibitor
of venezuelan equine encephalitis virus showed enhanced circulation
time and biocompatibility of the ml336 in
vivo155 sago and co-workers
reported a high-throughput method named find to screen lnps that can
bypass liver and deliver functional mrna to cells in
vivo156 broadly the relationship
between nanoparticle structure and mrna in vivo
delivery targets may be elucidated from this study nanocarriers are
used to prevent the systemic immunotoxicity of the protein-based drugs
and promote immuno-oncology therapeutics157 drug molecules are altered to improve their compatibility with a
particular class or type of nanocarriers rendering this a more
generic approach for drug candidates with similar physicochemical
properties158159 lipid bilayer nanocarriers
liposomes are preferred nanocarriers for ph gradient-based remote
loading of amphiphilic and ionizable drugs160 the
hydrophobicity of doxorubicin was chemically modified to increase its
compatibility with polylactic-co-glycolic acid
nanoparticles161 another approach of
interest here is the synthesis of prodrugs to ensure
their compatibility and incorporation within particular nanocarriers
along with their controlled and localized release characteristics
anti-hiv prodrugs of antiretroviral arv candidate cabotegravir has
been synthesized by functionalizing fatty acid esters with variable
carbon lengths followed by its poloxamer coating to get stable
nanocrystal formulations in vivo pharmacokinetic
studies in mice and rhesus macaques revealed significantly improved
effectiveness of cabotegravir showing prolonged drug release and
pharmacokinetic parameters162 another arv prodrug
strategy for highly aqueous-soluble emtricitabine using bioreversible
carbonate and carbamate masking groups shows sustained prodrug
release predicted by in vitro to in
vivo extrapolation modeling163 wei
and co-workers have reported the use of cholesterol-modified
hydroxychloroquine chol-hcq loaded liposomes that lowered the dose
and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine and also inhibited the
proliferation of rat lung fibroblasts thereby reducing pulmonary
fibrosis this strategy can be adopted to have dual benefits in
sar-cov-2 patients which show viral load and pulmonary
fibrosis164 using a hydrolyzable ester
linkage an irinotecan hydrophilic and chlorambucil hydrophobic
anticancer drugdrug conjugate has been synthesized165 nanoparticles synthesized by self-assembly of
this amphiphilic drugdrug conjugate shows prolonged systemic
retention tumor tissue accumulation and increased cellular uptake
hydrolyzable ester linkers conjugated to docetaxel permitted its
effective loading and release from core-cross-linked polymeric
micelles to provide a high therapeutic efficacy against breast and
ovarian cancer166 another similar prodrug
fatty acids conjugated to cabazitaxel with peg-lipid
results in self-assembled nanoparticles showing reduced systemic
toxicity and superior anticancer efficacy167 combination drug therapy is another possibility for treatment of
covid-19 offering several advantages such as lower dosages of the
individual drugs causing fewer side effects achieving multiple and
complimenting therapeutic targets and reducing the likelihood of
resistance development several such combinations for novel
coronavirus treatment are documented in the who landscape information
table 2 nanocarriers
are also intrinsically very useful for the delivery of multiple drugs
with different physicochemical properties promising the full potential
of combination therapies168169 the flexibility offered by a
variety of nanomaterials and fabrication techniques enables the design
of drug combinations loaded in nanocarriers with excellent control in
preserving synergistic drug ratios overlapping pharmacokinetics and
reducing combination allied side-effects170

with significant anti-hiv activity in primary cns cells this
multifunctional nanotherapeutic strategy can be applied to target
sars-cov-2 that has migrated to the cns181
however drug combination regimens are a standard of care for a wide
range of therapeutics but optimizing their nanoformulations is an
uphill task these optimization challenges include analyzing the
interaction between two or more drugs balancing the
antagonismsynergytoxicity and controlling the release profile of
individual drugs182183 high-throughput screening
methods are required to understand the biological interactions and
discover any kind of synergism that is present in
vitro screening methods to determine ideal drug ratios
demand an upgrade to mimic the 3d microenvironment of the target human
tissue184 preclinical animal models are
critical to accelerating the clinical translation but a disparity
between the model of disease in animals and human disease is the major
reason for the failure of the study185
nanomedicine scientists should take advantage of advanced drug
development tools screening technologies bioinformatics animal
models etc to investigate and validate nanoparticle
combination therapeutics the apparent similarity of sars-cov-2 with other viruses mainly sars-cov
and mers-cov along with the previous knowledge of their protective
immune responses is of great help to successfully develop covid-19
vaccine121131 nanoparticles can be loaded
with a wide range of antigenic moieties by physical entrapment or
chemical conjugation and a correct antigenic display makes it a
highly relevant alternate in vaccinology when compared to conventional
approaches197199 in addition to
safeguarding the native structure of the antigen nanoparticles also
improve the delivery and presentation of antigens to the
antigen-presenting cells apcs the key advantages of vaccine
nanocarriers are their nanosize since many biological systems such as
viruses including sars-cov-2 and proteins are also nanosized
nanoparticles can be administered by oral and intranasal routes and
subcutaneous and intramuscular injections offering a key advantage by
overcoming tissue barriers and targeting key locations such as lymph
nodes penetrate mucosal and epithelial barriers airway nasal
gastrointestinal etc200202 previous reports have suggested that both
humoral and cell-mediated immunity performs a protective role in the
sars-cov infection203204 nanoparticles have shown
their ability to target both adaptive t cells b cells and innate
immune systems macrophages monocytes neutrophils at the cellular
level modulating apcs using nanoparticles could be very important
particularly for covid-19 vaccine strategies205206 the
ability of nanoparticles to deliver antigen to dendritic cells dcs
by enhancing antigen presentation and several other mechanisms can
promote t cell immunity207 smith et
al explained various nanoparticle-based mechanisms to
alter the immune response induction in figure 6208 to improve the
efficacy and safety of the vaccine approach a big advantage presented
by nanoparticles is their ability to deliver molecular adjuvants and
in some cases nanomaterials themselves possess an intrinsic adjuvant
property for the loaded antigens the who reports dated may 27 2020
various preclinical stage nanoparticle-based vaccine candidates table 3126 overall vaccine history indicates major successes against acute
infectious diseases where naturally developed immunity majorly by
neutralizing antibodies provides enduring protection in a section of
patients one of the bigger challenges in the covid-19 vaccine
research is to identify approaches that stimulate both the t cell and
b cell immunity against this virus another challenge is the necessity
of accelerating the development of precise
next-generation vaccine strategies that may also
address specific population subgroups or individuals with compromised
immunity209 smart strategies to develop
nanocarrier-based covid-19 vaccines are equally important and
sometimes overlapping when paralleled to nanocarrier-based
therapeutics121210 the nanovaccine strategy
also requires a strong focus on the cellular presentation of the
selected antigen along with the selection of appropriate
nanocarriernanomaterial to induce complimenting immunomodulatory
effects the following section highlights the rational design of
nanocarrier-based vaccines with two strategies loading antigens inside or on the surface of nanocarriers is dependent on
several factors including the antigens physicochemical
characteristics biological stability target sites and required
immunogen release rate physical adsorption of antigens on
nanoparticles is based on its surface charge and noncovalent
hydrophobic interactions antigens with an amphoteric nature are most
suitable for adsorption or surface immobilization on nanocarriers such
as chitosan and dextran sulfate-based polymeric nanoparticles
inorganic nanoparticles such as aunps and carbon
nanotubes211214 antigen release in such
cases is predesigned based on the properties of the biological
environment like ph ionic strength temperature
etc encapsulation and matrix entrapment of the
antigens within a nanocarrier is another technique used to prevent its
biological degradation polylactide-co-glycolide
plga nanoparticles are ideal for encapsulating antigens and provide
controlled or extended biological release215 these
nanoparticles are effective preclinically in carrying antigens such as
hbsag malaria antigens tetanus toxoid listeria
monocytogenes antigens and bacillus
anthracis spores generating prolonged cellular and
humoral immune response216 the mrna-based covid-19 vaccine is already under clinical trial employing
lnps as a carrier naked mrnas are sensitive to the degradation by
extracellular rnases thus formulating its delivery vehicle is
essential217218 further these mrnas entail
their cell-specific receptor recognition and lipid membrane
penetration cytosolic presence of exogeneous mrna then triggers the
cellular machinery for its translation into fully functional
protein219 lnps are virus-sized
80200 nm particles synthesized by the self-assembly of an
ionizable cationic lipid220 they possess the
ability to deliver mrna efficiently into the cytoplasm as
demonstrated by several studies sustained-release kinetics of mrna
expression and thus protein translation can be achieved by opting for
intramuscular and intradermal routes providing high antibody titers
and both b cells and t cells immune responses138
different nanoparticles of these cationic lipids such as
12-dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammoniumpropane dotap or
dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine dope are formulated with subtle
modifications such as cationic lipids  cholesterol nanoparticle
cationic lipids  cholesterol  peg-lnp where cholesterol is used to
increase stability and peg-lipid to increases the formulation

nucleases and incomplete delivery to specialized immune cells
nanocarriers based on cationic lipids quite similar to mrna deliver
synthetic and natural polymers and inorganic particles are proposed
for dna-based vaccine formulations polymeric nanocarriers
encapsulating dna prevent biological inactivation and provide
controlled release and targeted cell delivery plga nanocarriers are
the most studied polymeric platform for dna vaccine development

well documented cationic polymer-based nanocarriers for dna vaccine
design are chitosan nanoparticles and pei nanoparticlescomplexes use
of peg functionalization on nanoparticle surfaces is quite common to
introduce stealth characteristics it renders them undetectable to
phagocytes and prevent reticuloendothelial system clearance prevent
nonspecific protein interaction reduce systemic toxicity and improve
stability228229 to improve the delivery of
mrnadna across the cell and nucleus membrane physical technologies
such as the gene gun and electroporation are being explored

technology to induce pores in the cell membrane to insert the dna

efficient cellular delivery to elicit b cell and t cell response in
pigs231 the clinical future of such portable
electroporation technologies is now apparent in the race of covid-19
vaccine research232 an ongoing clinical trial
nct04336410 is using a dna plasmid encoding sars-cov-2 s-protein as
a vaccine candidate for intradermally administration using an
electroporation device cellectra 2000 vaccine adjuvants nanoparticles vans are considered to improve the
overall efficacy and safety of the generated immune response
particularly in covid-19 pandemic situation vaccine adjuvants are
critical to reducing the required antigen dose dose-sparing
permitting the production of more units and making it available to
larger population233 among many preclinical
covid-19 vaccine candidates five protein subunit vaccine candidates
are reported using a combination of antigen and adjuvant nvx-cov2373
a nanoparticle vaccine recombinant sars-cov-2 glycoprotein based
with an adjuvant matrix m is now expected to move into clinical
trials soon hence it is important to discuss the possible strategies
employed by vans in other research studies that could help to improve
current covid-19 vaccine designs informing specific immune cells to
mount a protective immune response against a specific antigen is the
basic mechanism of vans designed to improve efficacy by serving as
immunity promoting cues also called as danger
signals234 in the case of a virus
these danger signals are characterized as pamps and damage-associated
molecular patterns damps derived from the same virus235 pamps and damps are recognized by specific
receptors called pattern recognition receptors prrs an example of
such receptors is toll-like receptors which are expressed by immune
cells to upregulate robust t and b cell priming by releasing
inflammatory cytokines236238 adjuvants
improving safety provide a kind of counter-regulatory signal
instructing the immune system to develop a tolerance for incoming
antigens vans can either act as a nanocarrier for molecular adjuvants
or have an inherent physicochemical property to stimulate pro- or
anti-immunity pathway211 vans are designed to tackle the limitations related to the conventional
delivery of molecular vaccine adjuvants such as rapid bloodstream
clearance systemic distribution and lack of immune cell targeting as
well as lack of antigen-adjuvant colocalization polymeric
nanoparticles encapsulating small molecules are employed for lymphoid
organ-specific delivery with controlled exposure the dose-sparing
effect is reported with antigen and cyclic dinucleotide adjuvant
agonist of inf gene stimulator coloaded liposomal nanoparticles
showing safe and uncompromised immune responses239
lymph node targeting of vans is an established strategy to achieve a
significantly high-dose-sparing effect whereas dcs targeting vans may
enhance its adjuvanticity in vivo study results
against infectious challenge has shown plga and calcium phosphate
nanoparticles co-encapsulating both antigen and adjuvants to improve
efficacy by enhancing antigen uptake apc activation and higher
antibody titers240242 in other studies co-encapsulation strategy
allows the colocalization of antigen and adjuvant in
endosomalphagosomal compartments fostering the activation of dcs and
triggers robust cross-presentation and t cell
priming243244 synergized activation of
apcs and prolonged antibody response was observed with the codelivery
of tlr4 and tlr7 small molecule adjuvants using plga
nanoparticles245 vans including plga
aunps are also employed to codeliver self-antigens or
immunoregulatory drugs as adjuvants to induce antigen-specific
peripheral tolerance of autoreactive t cells and block any serious
autoimmune response246251 nanoparticles because of their intrinsic adjuvanticity by activating
complement system inducing autophagy and activation of inflammasome
are also considered as vans252258 surface chemistry and hydrophobicity of
nanoparticles along with other physicochemical properties are capable
of electing these adjuvanticity mechanisms

hydroxyl groups dependent compliment system activation followed by
cellular immunity enhancement is reported with pluronic-stabilized
polypropylene sulfide nanoparticles259 antigen
conjugated alumina nanoparticles have been reported to enhance
cellular and humoral immune responses as a result of autophagy
induction in dcs fostering antigen cross-presentation to t
cells255 gold and plg nanoparticles are
reported to activate nalp3 inflammasome in dcs resulting in improved
adjuvanticity similar to an alum-mediated adjuvanticity
mechanism261262 increased side-chain
hydrophobicity of poly-glutamic acid nanoparticles displayed
augmented uptake and dcs activation263 similarly
aunp surface hydrophobicity can increase the expression of
inflammatory cytokines both in vitro and in
vivo264 vaccine adjuvants have been used to increase the efficiency and the
antibody responses of vaccines in the elderly they comprise the most
vulnerable groups of the population and have the highest case-fatality
rate of the covid-19 disease265266 aging is
associated with continuous chronic subclinical systemic inflammation

virosomes and microparticles are among the various adjuvants
technologies developed to improve the influenza vaccination in the
older population129 squalene-based ow emulsion
adjuvants mf59 and as03 have been licensed for influenza vaccines
meant for the elderly269270 a liposome-based adjuvant
as01 is another key example of licensed technology developed for the
herpes zoster subunit vaccine aiming old age population 70 years or
above271272 addition of adjuvants has
shown a decreased risk of pneumonia and influenza in clinical trials
and can hence play a significant role in regulating the immune system
responses of the elderly which further can be tuned for covid-19
vaccine progress129 the scope of nanotechnology for covid-19 therapeutics and vaccine research is
not limited to conventional therapeutic and vaccine designs several other
approaches including advanced nanomaterial and biomimetic approaches
represent good potential usage in a covid-19-like outbreak szunerits and

the sars-cov-2 virus its pathophysiology and related immunological
response is vital for nanotechnology scientists in the absence of a
specific antiviral against sars-cov-2 present therapeutics target the
multifaceted molecular interactions involved in viral infections and majorly
comprises repurposing already existing antiviral molecules used for other

effective this manuscript provides systematic information on nanomedicine
strategies employed to deliver small molecules biologicals specifically
rnai and various combination therapies some strategies are also proposed
for the rational development of this nanomedicine approach and its clinical
translation the journey of covid-19 vaccine development is very impressive
and involves high-tech platforms such as viral vectors antigen carriers
and delivery technology a mrna-based vaccine employing nanoparticle lnps
delivery is already in clinical trials whereas another vaccine candidate in
the clinical phase is using electroporation technology for the intradermal
administration of dna plasmid since most of the covid-19 vaccine candidates
are sophisticated biological moieties dna mrna recombinant proteins

becomes highly pertinent this manuscript details the opportunities
presented by these nanocarriers to potentiate the success of covid-19
vaccine in terms of efficacy and safety some of these opportunities include
nanocarrier-based effectivetargeted delivery better antigen presentation
and the induction of complimenting immunomodulatory effect rational

success hence strategies related to the nanocarrier selection for antigen
loading and effective delivery are discussed in this manuscript a special

2 the viruses are positive-sense rna enveloped and non-segmented 2 this coronavirus disease covid-19 is known as a third human zoonosis of the 21st century and is caused by a new strain not previously identified in humans 1 the coronaviruses causing minor infections of the respiratory tract in humans are nl63 oc43 hcov-229e and hku1 while the lethal coronavirus infections that emerged in this century are the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the recent sars-cov 2 or covid-19 2 the source of the covid-19 is still not confirmed but some evidence suggests that the source may be in the seafood market of huanan in wuhan china 3
4 the center for disease control and prevention cdc reported that the recent covid-19 is caused by betacoronavirus just like the previous two outbreaks of coronaviruses mers and sars the source of which is camels and bats respectively 5 the first transmission of cov from animals to humans was notified in 2002 causing sars-cov with a 10 mortality rate 6 it was suggested that the virus needs some intermediate reservoir to infect humans efficiently as confirmed later by a thorough investigation revealing palm civets and raccoon dogs of the wet market carried sars-cov viral rna and might act like intermediate reservoirs 3 the covid-19 rna virus carries a high mutation rate and ability to transfer from person to person as compared to other coronaviruses according to the world health organization who till 23rd february 2020 the covid-19 affected a total of 78811 individuals across globally of which 77042 were reported in china while 1769 were reported in other countries the death toll in china is 2445 and 17 deaths have been reported in the rest of the world according to the reports till 2nd january 2020 41 patients have been admitted to the hospital of which most of the patients were men and 66 of them had exposure to the huanan seafood market and the median age of patients was 49 years 2 the health-care workers are also diagnosed with the infection including those working in similar wards 6 the time taken by covid-19 to infect other individuals is similar to that of sars it is estimated that on average each infected person infects 2-3 persons and this occurrence increases two-folds every 64 days 7 it was observed that people with mild infection are more actively spread the infection 8 due to critical nature of the outbreak the virus was sequenced on urgent basis and the first sequence was available on 10th january 2020 online at virologicalorg it was noted that covid-19 has much resemblance to sars-cov at the genomic level 4 symptoms of covid-19 include fever dry cough shortness of breath and dyspnea sore throat and leukopenia to date no vaccine covid-19 is available and is need of an hour to develop a vaccine to prevent further spread of the disease to this end immuno-informatics can be applied to a complete protein data set of the virus for deep antigen analysis and thus can save time and cost for designing a vaccine against covid-19 this will ease the early development of a vaccine and proposed design can be subjected immediately to experimental trials the complete dataset of proteins available in ncbi 9

was retrieved and subjected to screening phase to identify potential vaccine candidates first host non-similar proteins of the pathogen were filtered that show no homology to the human host taxonomic id 9606 proteins having sequence e score  10 e5 bit score  100 and sequence identity  30  were selected 10 again a blastp search against the mouse mus musculus taxonomy id 10090 was performed using host non-similar proteins keeping the input parameters e score cut-off 0005 bit score  100 and identity  30 11 the screened mouse non-similar proteins were then subjected to tmhmm 20 12 and hmmtop 20 13 for observing the number of transmembrane helices proteins having less than two transmembrane helices were subjected to spaan 14 for predicting the adhesive proteins as they have the potential to facilitate attachment to the host tissues 15 selected vaccine candidates were then used in blastp tool to align the selected adhesive protein candidates with the probiotic bacteria proteome including three lactobacillus species l rhamnosus tax id 47715 l johnsonii tax id 33959 and lactobacillus casei tax id 1582 to avoid accidental inhibition of the useful gut bacteria 11 selected vaccine candidates were then subjected to the immune epitope database iedb bepipred linear epitope prediction 20 16 17 18 the threshold of 05 was used for the prediction of linear b-cells epitopes which were then utilized in t-cell epitopes mapping to identify subsequences with the potential to bind reference set of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i and ii alleles 16 epitopes were ranked according to their percentile score the ones with the low percentile were considered as high affinity binders the selected b-cell derived t-cell epitopes were then subjected to mhcpred 20 19 analysis for interpreting their binding affinity potential the cut-off criterion was set to ic50 values  100 nm for drb010120 following this the virulentpred 21 and vaxijen 20 22 were utilized to validate the virulence and antigenicity of the selected epitopes respectively allertop 20 23 was applied to remove the allergic epitopes clc main workbench was employed to check the conservation of non-allergic epitopes required for designing an effective broad-spectrum vaccine overlapping immunodominant epitopes were used to construct a multi-epitope peptide mep which is considered a promising strategy to stop viral infections 24 one of the key issues with the design of peptide vaccine is its weak immunogenicity that can be resolved by designing a mep with appropriate adjuvants 25 in the current study mep was designed using aay linkers to combine screened multiple epitopes 26 to the n-terminal of mep an adjuvant in the form of b subunit of cholera toxin was linked to the mep thus creating a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct mepvc 27 the tertiary structure of the mepvc was created through a software called 3dpro of scratch protein predictor 28 i-tasser 29 and swiss-model 30 the best model was further loop modelled using galaxyloop 31 and refined using galaxyrefine 32 of galaxyweb to improve the constructs stability disulfide bonds were introduced in the structure 33 using design 20 34 the sequence of the mepvc was translated in reverse and then optimized for codon usage according to the escherichia coli which will end up in the increased expression of the mepvc sequence cloned in the mentioned expression system 35 the entire activity was accomplished using java codon adaptation tool jcat server 36 in order to assess the expression of sequence that have been cloned the gc content and codon adaptation index cai were measured the value of 1 cai is contemplated ideal 3738 whereas the appropriate gc content should be fluctuated between 30-70 due to favorable transcriptional and translational efficiencies 27 there were other input factors carefully calculated to prevent rho-independent transcription termination the binding sites of the prokaryotic ribosome and the cleavage sites of restriction enzyme as the final step of this phase the cloning of the engineered construct was carried out into pet-28a  expression vector using snapgene httpswwwsnapgenecom protparam tool 39 was applied for analyzing the physical and chemical properties of mepvc such as amino acid composition estimated half-life instability index extinction coefficient theoretical pl atomic composition molecular weight and grand average of hydropathicity gravy to assist experimental studies instability index is one of the key parameters that is significantly considered as it helps in discarding the unstable protein candidates protein instability index  40 in this step the vaccine construct underwent immune response profiling and immunogenicity classification which was done using the c-immsim server 40 in order to predict the immune epitopes a position-specific scoring matrix pssm employed by c-immsim was used whereas the different machine learning procedures were used to forecast the immune connections this server is concurrently used to execute an immune simulation for 3 compartments such as bone marrow tertiary lymph nodes and thymus 41 default simulation parameters were used which are as follows random seed 12345 simulation steps 100 simulation volume 10 host hla selection a mhc class i a0101 allele b mhc class i b0702 dr mhc class ii drb10101 allele and time step of injection was set to 1 the technique of molecular docking was utilized to predict conformation of the mepvc with respect to a suitable innate immune receptor this analysis plays a significant role to determine the high-affinity contacts amid the vaccine construct and the immune receptor the pdb id 4g8a and tlr3 pdb id 2a0z were retrieved from the protein data bank pdb for the tlr4 and tlr3 respectively blind docking employed to calculate the regular pose of the vaccine construct with the mentioned receptors using an online patchdock server 42 the resulting structures were further refined using the fast interaction refinement in molecular docking firedock 43 the top ranked complex with the minimum global energy was selected and used to analyse the binding pose and intermolecular connections using ucsf chimera 1131 44 discovery studio ds visualizer 1720 4516349 and visual molecular dynamics vmd 193 software 46 in order to gain insights into the dynamics of the vaccine construct with the receptors molecular dynamics md simulations have been carried out the simulation analysis was also important to validate the exposure of epitopes towards the host structure for identification and handling of a substantial outcome the md simulations took place in three different phases system preparation pre-processing and production 47 with an assistant model building with energy refinement amber 16 48 the antechamber program 49 was used to build the libraries and parameters for the tlr4 and vaccine construct the tip3p solvation box size 12  was inserted to solvate the construct to study the intermolecular interactions force field ff14sb 50 was used whereas the system was neutralized by the addition of na counter ions in the second phase of md simulations the energy minimization of the complexes was carried out each complex was minimized using the following steps the energy minimization of hydrogen atoms 500 cycles energy minimization of water box 1000 cycles control of 200 kcalmol  2 on rest of the system minimization of the whole atoms of the system 1000 cycles with the restraint of 5 kcalmol 2 on c atoms and the rest of the system was subjected to non-heavy atoms minimization with 300 cycles and restraint of 100 kcalmol 2 in the next step the system was gradually heated from 0 k to 300 k with the time step of 2 femtoseconds and restraints of 5 kcalmol 2 on c atoms in order to sustain the temperature of the system langevin dynamics 51 with the gamma value of 10 was castoff the shake algorithm 52 was used to put constraints on the hydrogen bonds of the system for heating in the next step systems were equilibrated for 100 ps with a time step of 2 fs followed by pressure equilibrium which was attained using the npt ensemble with restraints of 5 kcalmol   2 on c atoms the same step was extended for 50 ps with the 1 scale down on restraints on carbon atoms however the step of system equilibration was carried out for a time scale of 1 nanosecond followed by the production run of 100 ns with a time scale of 2 fs for the production run the berendsen algorithm 53 with the nvt ensemble cast off with a cut-off of 80  simulation trajectories were calculated to investigate the strength of a complex via the cpptraj module 54 of amber however the visualization of simulation trajectories was done with ucsf chimera 55 ds visualizer 45 and vmd 46 in order to estimate the mmpbsa binding free energies for the receptors and multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct the mmpbsapy module 56 of amber16 was castoff the program generated the input files for the complex receptor and mepvc molecule using the ante-mmpbsapy module to compute the variance between the solvated and un-solvated phases 100 frames of simulation trajectories were picked and analyzed 57 for the precise values of binding free energies the two different conformations were matched to the binding energies of significant residues to estimate the free binding energy of the anticipated complex gbind solv was resolved using the three equations given below1gbindsolvgbindvaccumgsolvcomplexgsolvligandgsolvcomplex

 the net free binding energy was then decomposition into each residue to highlight the interacting and stable residues the ncbi most recently dedicated a coronavirus disease data hub containing all nucleotide and protein sequences information published from across the world in this study we aimed at in silico prioritization potential vaccine candidates and designing a chimeric peptide vaccine for covid-19 based on all available protein sequences in the data hub several bioinformatic and immunoinformatics techniques are employed with the aim to assist experimentalists in vaccine development against the virus prioritization of potential vaccine candidates could help in minimizing time labor cost and resources for developing and optimizing the success of getting an effective vaccine against the pathogen in total 193 protein entries were retrieved s-table 1
 and analyzed first for sequence homology with the human host proteome this was significant to evaluate as homology between virus protein s to be used in vaccine designing and the host is likely to cause strong autoimmune reactions in the host 58 this check identified two proteins orf1a polyprotein accession id yp009725295 and nsp3 accession id yp009725299 as host homologous thus discarded from further evaluations experimental studies of the human vaccines are usually done in mice because of the many practical advantages they provide compared to vaccine research in higher animal models 22 the appropriateness of mice as an animal model for vaccine research is defined by its ability to reproduce relevant human physiology 59 considering this a homology check was devoted to the pipeline and applied to the filtered human non-similar proteins 191 in number to ensure the selection of non-similar mice proteins this assessment resultant into shortlisting of orf1ab polyprotein accession ids qhq82463 qhd43415 qhr63279 qhr63259 qhq71962 qho62106 qhq71972 qhr63249 qho60603 qho62111 qhn73794 qhr84448 qhr63269 qhn73809 qhr63289 and qho62876 and nsp3 accession id yp009724389 as mice similar proteins the mice non-similar proteins will aid in discouraging false positive results during in vivo experimentations and accurate interpretation of immune protective efficiency of the prioritized vaccine candidates against the virus 2260 next enumeration of transmembrane helices in the pooled 174 mice non-similar proteins was accomplished this transmembrane topology characterization is deemed vital in relatedness to the afterward experimental expression studies of the proteins protein with transmembrane helices less than 2 in numbers are often considered as best vaccine candidates as multiple helices make recombinant proteins purification and expression difficult in vaccine development 20 this result 33 proteins spanning across five types and include orf3a polyprotein accession id qhq71974 qhr84450 qhd43417 qhq71964 qhq82465 qho60595 yp009724391 qhn73811 qhn73796 qho62878 nsp4 accession id yp009725300 membrane glycoprotein accession id qhd43419 qhq71966 qhq71976 qhq82467 yp009724393 qho60597 qhn73813 qhn73798 qho62880 qhr84452 membrane protein accession id qhr63283 qhr63263 qhr63273 qhr63293 qhr63253 matrix protein accession id qho62109 qho62114 and nonstructural protein ns3 accession id qhr63251 qhr63281 qhr63261 qhr63271 qhr63291 containing multiple helices therefore not proceeded further the creation of adhesin-based vaccines is considered an attractive and effective strategy and is being explored as a solution to number of infectious pathogens 61 the idea behind exploiting adhesin for a vaccine is based on the promising preclinical findings the aim is to confer protective immunity via two main mechanisms i opsonization driven by opsonising antibodies that is capable of binding the target antigen as an immunological tag leading to activation of other components of the host immune system for enhance recognition of the pathogen and subsequent complement system activity and virus killing by phagocytosis ii neutralization driven by adhesin-specific antibodies that block virus binding ability to host tissues the adhesion probability computation revealed 26 protein to have adhesion probability value greater than a threshold as tabulated in s-table 2
and can be ideal putative vaccine candidates against covid-19 the adhesin probability of protein ranges from 0593 to 0796 mean 0645antigenicity of proteins was predicted to reflect their ability of binding to products of adaptive immunity antibodies or t-cell receptors in total 7 proteins nsp8 nsp9 nsp10 3c-like proteinase spike glycoprotein surface glycoprotein and orf1ab polyprotein were recognized as antigenic and scored higher than the threshold coronavirus nsp8 suggested having diverse activities including template-dependent rna polymerase activities canonical rna-dependent rna polymerases cofactor function of nsp8 for nsp12-mediated rna-dependent rna polymerase activity and metal ion-dependent rna 3 polyadenylation activities 62 nsp9 is a non-structural protein 9 key to coronavirus replication and is a single-stranded rna-binding protein 63 nsp10 is a critical cofactor that switches on multiple enzymes in replication cycle it is known to interact with nsp14 and nsp16 subunits activating their respective 3-5 exoribonuclease and 2-o-methyltransferase functions 64 the 3c-like proteinase is main cysteine protease and is nonstructural protein number 5 nsp5 and essential in mediating cleavage of nsp4 to nsp16 65 the trimeric transmembrane coronavirus spike glycoprotein initiates infectious cycle by binding to a specific receptor on the host membrane followed by viral fusion 66 the surface glycoprotein was analyzed to be different in a sequence patch leu3-phe11 at the start of the spike glycoprotein the orf1ab is replicase polyprotein cleaved by papain-like protease and 3c-like protease at specific cleavage sites to yield 15 to 16 non-structural proteins nsps 67  the final numbers of potential vaccine candidates obtained in this step by step subtraction phase are presented in fig 2
 identification of epitopes in given antigens is vital for a number of practical reasons including understanding etiology of a disease monitoring of immune system development of diagnostic assays and epitope-based vaccines designing 68 from vaccine designing point of view host adaptive immunity is highly specific and is able to recognize and destroy the invading pathogen 69 additionally adaptive immunity is able to remember the pathogens creating long-lasting pathogen-specific protective memory enabling stronger attacks against the pathogen reencountered on successive times 70 this arm of host immune system is driven by lymphocytes of two types b and t-cells responsible for the humoral and cell-mediated immunity respectively 71 both cells recognize pathogen molecular components called antigens the antigens interact with specific receptors present on the surface of b and t-cells the activation of both these cells required antigen recognition by these receptors in addition to the second activation signals from the innate system the vaccine candidates prioritized in the first phase were deeply investigated for b-cell epitopes different lengths of linear b-cell epitopes were predicted for each protein and only recurrent epitopes simultaneously predicted by different servers were selected for chimeric vaccine designing the b-cell epitopes predicted for the vaccine candidates were in the following order nine for nsp8 and 3c-like proteinase five for nsp9 eight for nsp10 34 for spike glycoprotein and surface glycoprotein and four for orf1ab polyprotein partial these b-cells epitopes are recognized as solvent-exposed antigens through b-cell receptors bcr and upon activation b-cells secrete antibodies antibodies have different functions including neutralizing pathogens toxins and labeling pathogens for destruction 72 the proteins were also analyzed for t-cell epitopes through very stringent criteria of p-value less than 0005 the epitopes were of different lengths and interact with several different alleles of mhc-i and mhc-ii for nsp8 94 epitopes predicted whereas nsp9 nsp10 3c-like proteinase spike glycoprotein surface glycoprotein and orf1ab polyprotein partial protein were mapped for 61 76 153 657 651 and 44 respectively t-cell epitopes these epitopes are presented on the surface through specific receptors known as t-cell receptor tcr allowing recognition of these antigens when displayed by antigen-presenting cells bound to mhc molecules 73 epitopes presented by mhc i are recognized by cd8 cytotoxic t lymphocytes 74 whereas those presented by mhc ii are recognized by cd4 t-cells 75 the cd4 t-cells later become helper t-cells that amplify the immune responses against the pathogen comparative analysis of the predicted epitopes was further carried out to select epitopes that are common to b-cell cd4 t-cell and cd8 t-cell alleles in order to design a specific effective and strong vaccine on this basis three epitopes from nsp8 drdaamqrk qarsedkra eqavangdsev none for nsp9 and orf1ab polyprotein partial protein four for nsp10 gcscdqlrep ylasggqpit ylasggqpi tvtpeanmdqesfg three for 3c-like proteinase edmlnpnyedl kynyepltqdhv eftpfdvvr five for spike glycoprotein rvystgsnvfq vnnsyecdipi ladagfikqygdclg gqskrvdfc rnfyepqiittd and surface glycoprotein rvystgsnvfq vnnsyecdipi ladagfikqygdclg gqskrvdfc rnfyepqiittd the epitopes were then reevaluated in antigenicity check to make sure their binding potential of binding to immune cells for nsp8 drdaamqrk and qarsedkra were found antigenic with score higher than the default threshold of 04 whereas the third epitope eqavangdsev was found non-antigenic hence removed all the four epitopes of nsp9 revealed non-antigenic therefore not processed further in case of 3c-like proteinase kynyepltqdhv was found non-antigenic whereas edmlnpnyedl and eftpfdvvr were antigenic therefore considered in afterward analysis the spike glycoprotein contains epitopes vnnsyecdipi and rnfyepqiittd as antigenic whereas none of the surface glycoprotein provided epitopes were antigenic following the affinity of the filtered antigenic epitopes for the most prevalent drb0101 allele in humans was evaluated through ic50 value and those with value  100 nm were classified as high affinity binders all the pooled antigenic epitopes were found to have great ability of binding to the mentioned allele similarly these epitopes were evaluated in allergenicity and virulent potential check and only virulent and non-allergen were selected virulent check was significant in ensuring selection of epitopes mediating infectious pathways in the host the final selected epitopes that cleared all these checks are tabulated in table 1 a mep was constructed first comprising epitopes finalized in the previous phase mep based vaccines are considered an ideal approach to prevent and treat viral infections 24 the epitopes shown in table 1 were linked to each other through flexible aay linkers as such it allows efficient separation required for the effective working of each epitope once the mep was designed to its n-terminus an adjuvant of cholera toxin subunit b ctb was added 76 the schematic representation of the mepvc is shown in fig 3
 ctb is nontoxic part of cholera toxin and is considered an accelerator in protective immunity and a break in auto-immunity it shows high affinity for monosialotetrahexosylganglioside displayed on variety of cell types including gut epithelial cells antigen-presenting cells dendritic and macrophages and b-cells 77 ctb is a preferred choice as an adjuvant because of its ability of self-expression in variety of organisms and can be coupled to antigens through several approaches involving chemical manipulation and genetic fusion resulting in strong immunological responses against the antigens to which it is attached the vaccine construct was then used in a comparative 3d structure prediction to ensure confidentiality in selection of the most suitable model for the construct with minimum structural errors several different physicochemical properties of the mepvc were deduced from its sequence the vaccine construct is 189 amino acids long with total number of 2984 atoms the molecular weight of the construct is ideal ie 2136 kd as small size construct is easy to handle and purify during experimental evaluation the construct has instability index value of 3543 signifying its high stability the aliphatic index computed for the construct is 7968 reflecting high thermostability the estimated half-life in mammals yeast and escherichia coli is 30 hours  20 hours and  10 hours respectively the grand average of hydropathicity gravy score is -0315 which highlights hydrophilic nature of the construct the theoretical pi is 610 pointing to construct slightly acidic nature the secondary structure elements of the vaccine construct can be divided into the following order alpha helix 5608  310 helix 0  pi helix 0  beta bridge 0  extended strand 1640  beta-turn 794  bend region 0  and random coil 1958  compared to the i-tasser phyre2 and swiss-model the 3dpro predicted structure was determined as the most suitable structure based on the complete modeling of the given length of the amino acid sequence loop modeling was done at leu29-gln37 ser51-gln70 glu72-gln77 glu57-ser76 val103-thr113 and glu167-asp186 the model was refined to minimum rmsd of 1734  and molprobity score of 1134 that is quite low compared to the original structure score of 3312 reflecting good quality of the modelled structure similarly the clash score in contrast to the original structure is 947 times lower demonstrating steric clash free structure the galaxy energy of the structure is very stable -378431 and ramachandran favored distribution increased from 936 to 957  the top 10 refined models of the mepvc are tabulated in table 2 the 3d models of the vaccine construct after loop modelling and refinement is presented in fig 4
a the overall z-score of the modelled structure is -4 and the score is within the range of same size proteins in the pdb illustrating good quality as depicted in fig 4b refinement of the structure ramachandran plot demonstrated the construct to contain 932  of its residues in the most favored regions while 57 00 11 residues are in additional allowed region generously allowed region and disallowed regions respectively fig 4c the overall average g-factor of the construct is 005

 in the follow up experimental studies the maximum expression of mepvc is highly desirable 35 one requirement for that is the codon usage of mepvc that must be adapted according to the expression system for instance here we used e coli k12 as a mepvc expression system the codon adaptation index cai and gc content revealed for the improved sequence are highly satisfactory with value of 096 and 4885 respectively strongly indicating high mepvc expression the mepvc then enclosed on both sites by 6x histidine tag to ease its purification process and inserted at appropriate sites of pet28a vector as shown in fig 6
 molecular interactions and binding conformation of the designed mepvc with tlr3 and tlr4 innate immune receptors were deciphered via a protein-peptide docking approach both tlr3 and tlr4 belong to toll-like receptor family of pattern recognition receptor and function to activate intracellular signaling nf-b pathway and production of inflammatory cytokines responsible for the development of effective innate immunity 7980 these receptors recognize viral associated molecular patterns and induce the production of interferon leading to activation of strong host defense responses also the specific adaptive immunity takes time to establish against antigens therefore its important to evaluate mepvc affinity for the innate immune receptors in case of mrpvc-tlr3 complex the patch dock predicted 10 best solutions sorted based on the docking geometric shape complementarity score s-table 3
 a high score implies enhanced affinity of the interacting molecules and best docked conformations of the molecules with respect to each other solution 3 was visualized for docked conformations and intermolecular forces responsible for such high affinity of the molecules the selection was based on the firedock analysis s-table 4
 which is an efficient package for refinement and reassigning procedure of docking scores to rigid body docking solutions the global binding energy of solution 3 is better ie -639 kjmol compared to the rest of predicted solutions the contribution to the total score form attractive van der waals vdw energy is -1212 kjmol repulsive vdw energy 479 kjmol hydrogen bond hb energy -163 kjmol and atomic contact energy ace 595 kjmol the mepvc within 3  was noticed to posed right in the center of the tlr3 receptor fig 7

a that combine igm and igg antibodies has a titer scale close to 10000ml followed by igm antibody  6000 antibody titer per ml the combined igg1 and igg2 and igg1 were seen to generate high titer scale of around 6300ml 3100ml and respectively the igg2 antibody response revealed to be low throughout post vaccine administration period the dimerized soluble cytokine ifn-g produced against the antigen is  400000 ngml fig 9b the stability and dynamics of the designed vaccine construct ensemble docked to innate immune receptors were disclosed through 100-ns of md production run and interpreted through the root mean square deviation rmsd 81 root mean square fluctuation rmsf 82 the radius of gyration rg 83 and beta factor -factor 84 assays as depicted in fig 10
 the average c atomic distance over 10000 frames of tlr3-mepvc and tlr4-mepvc was decoded through rmsd assay an average rmsd of 344  maximum 630  and 336  maximum 522  were estimated for tlr3-mepvc and tlr4-mepvc respectively the tlr3 and tlr4 receptors are observed more compact than the mepvc and as a result continuous movements of the vaccine construct through its length are noticed at the exposed regions though rooted stable at the docked position this seems to be responsible for bringing small structural deviation as probed by rmsd visual inspection of the trajectories illustrated no major global and local secondary structure conformation changes in the receptor tlr3 and tlr4 structure the mepvc movements with respect to the tlr3 are shown at different snapshots as illustrated in fig 11
 the mepvc seems responsible for the deviations in the receptor tlr4 at positions glu1-ser79 hie540-asn614 gln1144-gln1209 gln1347-pro1371 and lys1489-lys1491 continuous flexibility of the loops of mepvc exposed region is observed and is highly flexible responsible for the movements of the mepvc at the docked site though rooted stably fig 12
 the second statistical parameter computed for both complexes was the root mean square fluctuations rmsf that demonstrate average dynamical residue fluctuations over a specific length of time the mean rmsf concluded for tlr3-mepvc system is 21  whereas an average rmsf of 203  for tlr4-mepvc was demonstrated majority of the receptors residues are showing less variability and are satisfactory stable with mean rmsf  3  the residues range mentioned above were reported to have higher rmsf values and revealed fluctuating throughout the simulation time these fluctuations are in all likelihood as an outcome of the moving adjuvant of the mepvc this is supported by the fact that the mean rmsf of the mepvc is comparatively very high than that of receptors the rmsf of mepvc in tlr3-mepvc and tlr4-mepvc is 186  maximum 1016  and 745  maximum 1304  the receptors stability in both complexes is reaffirmed by radius of gyration rg analysis that depicted stable plot with mean value of 3397  maximum 3562  and 4101  maximum 4165  for tlr4-mepvc the rg findings are coherent with that of rmsd in interpreting systems stable behavior and compact nature of the receptors lastly thermal beta factor -factor indicated the same pattern of residues dynamics as shown by rmsf an average -factor derived from tlr3-mepvc and tlr4-mepvc is 12134  and 12347  respectively hydrogen bonding results when a hydrogen atom attached to a highly electronegative atom is attracted by another electronegative atom 85 in a biological system these hydrogen bonds are vital in determining specificity and directionality fundamental in molecular recognition 86 the patterns of hydrogen bonds for both complexes were illustrated in each frame within 3  in order to probe the strength of intermolecular association across the simulation period the maximum number of hydrogen bonds of mepvc with tlr3 and tlr4 are 11 and 12 respectively demonstrating the high strength of interactions the number of hydrogen bonds for both complexes are shown in fig 13
 in a protein molecule salt bridges are formed between charged side chains of amino acids at neutral ph the residues mainly involved in these interactions include negative full electron charge glutamine and aspartate and opposite positive full electron charge arginine and lysine 87 the presence of salt bridges between the interacting molecules is a clear sign of strengthening interaction stability for tlr3-mepvc complex high numbers of salt bridges were estimated within 32  between receptor glu8 glu276 arg306 glu333 with mepvc lys3 lys8 glu83 arg16 respectively in case of tlr4-mepvc complex receptor residues arg646 asp268 arg1396 are involved in salt bridging with asp146 arg175 and glu184 of the mepvc respectively the binding free energies of both tlr3-mepvc and tlr4-mepvc complexes were computed using continuum solvation mmpbsa and its complementary mmgbsa the binding free energies of the vaccine construct for the receptors were estimated considering molecular mechanics energies as well as solvation energies the net binding free energy for both complexes revealed to be very high illustrating the high interacting affinity of the molecules for tlr3-mepvc the total free energy of binding is -414273 kcalmol in mmgbsa while in mmpbsa it is -844908 kcalmol table 3 in case of tlr4-mepvc the net binding energy is -139690 kcalmol and -212289 kcalmol in mmgbsa and mmpbsa respectively the gas phase energy in tlr3-mepvc complex is highly dominating and contributes significantly to the overall binding energy the total gas phase energy of tlr3-mepvc is -5305792 kcalmol in mmgbsa and -5305792 kcalmol in mmpbsa the electrostatic contribution to the net gas phase energy is high ie -3932724 kcalmol in both mmgbsa and mmpbsa compared to van der waals energy -1373068 kcalmol the electrostatic energy contribution to the solvation energy is 5075596 kcalmol in mmgbsa and 4629381 kcalmol in mmpbsa and is highly non-favorable to the net solvation energy for tlr4-mepvc the net mmpbsa is the comparatively high -212289 kcalmol than the mmgbsa -139690 kcalmol with solvation energy noticed to dominate the overall interaction energies table 4 the solvation energy in mmgbsa and mmpbsa is -2452265 kcalmol electrostatic contribution -2402983 kcalmol and -2524865 kcalmol electrostatic contribution -2482779 kcalmol the net gas phase energy is 2312576 kcal mol in both mmgbsa and mmpbsa and major favorable contribution is from van der waals is -358526 kcalmol opposed to the non-favorable contributions is 2671101 kcalmol residue wise most of the interacting residues of tlr3 reported in docking assay have very low binding energy reflecting the highly stable nature of these residues in interaction and the key role they are playing in holding

immune system simulation to mepvc and a thorough peptide dynamics analysis a novel mepvc is proposed as a probable solution to the widely spread viral coronaviruses outbreak meanwhile this seems necessary to have a deep down lesson as covid-19 viral outbreak is propagating to the human species on this part of the universe called earth as we are already living under a serious threat of antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance 88 which if ignored can cause havoc and the current spread of covid-19 is a clear example of even a viral resistance coming in line referring to the introduction section where the probable cause of this viral attack is discussed this is mandatory to mention that there is retaliation from animals and animal-associated viruses or bacteria observed against homo sapiens quite frequently in the recent past 89 this not only alarms the way of consuming animals in our food in the form of livestock but at the same time explains the advancing defense system of various species around either it is horizontal gene transfer among bacteria or transient nature of viral transmission throughout the world as one way or the other this is a form of advanced defense of organisms it is meant to state that even before and after the cognitive revolution homo sapiens cannot be exempted from biological laws while considering under the realm of these biological laws this is much expected from all other species to have the right of keeping and exercising a defense mechanism 90 instead of spending on wars among humans there is a dire need to be equipped for all wars to come against human species under the disguise of either environmental hazards or antimicrobial resistance even viruses are finding new ways of infecting hosts under this perspective the role of avian has been observed as much dominating in the recent past 91 after having insights from comparative advancing mechanism we mention here and thereafter the preliminary existence of a theory of retaliation on the basis of currently available facts and observations this theory of retaliation will play its role in coming future the continuous attacks in the form of outbreaks by them have raised many challenges and threats to human beings a recent mechanism study by bazel et al reported h5n1 influenza viruses is posing threat to human and animal health and is currently unclear what restricts these interspecies jumps on the host side it is further signified that pb1-f2 a short viral peptide assists h5n1 bird influenza viruses to overcome a human restriction factor of the viral polymerase complex hax-1 it is also evidenced that a functional pb1-f2 aids in direct transmission of viruses from birds to humans 92 additionally there is already a mechanism existing for the antimicrobial defense of avian eggs which illustrates their efficacy in defense mechanisms 93 furthermore discovery of avian antimicrobial peptides classified as b-defensins present in chicken and turkey found active against bacteria fungi and yeast this is another example of advance mechanism showed by avian and the possibility of a common ancestral gene between avian and other mammalian peptides seems obvious 94 who alarmed quite often that influenza viruses with a vast silent reservoir in aquatic birds are impossible to eradicate while avian influenza is proved to be a threat to human health 95 even having the phylogenetic identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov some clinical characteristics differentiate sars-cov-2 from sars-cov mers-cov and seasonal influenza infections 296 this leads to the fact that viruses are attacking humans with different clinical features every time the complex relationships between the human and animal species never faced a halt in evolving giving rise to numerous infectious pathogens whatsoever is the case the dramatic impact of infectious diseases affecting the modern human population worldwide is evident and unexpected rise of coronavirus infections raised to 100000 while writing this research and getting beyond the normal control httpswwwnaturecomarticlesd41586-020-00154-w after all we belong to the kingdom animalia with even ten on ten embarrassing similarities to chimpanzees 97 probable prevention in this context is to somehow avoid the excruciating utilization and consumption of other mammals as edibles from homo sapiens and stop becoming a reason for the extinction of certain species avenging from these species from time to time by utilizing the microbes associated with them against human has become obvious and vaccine design and discovery is of utmost importance this is crucial to strategize a preventive control not only for symptomatic relief but in general taking steps to prevent hunting and strategy required to maintain a balanced ecosystem where specifically avian will not dwell under threat by sapiens the advent of various new mechanisms of viral survival has remained sapiens perplexed and a broader strategy is required to circumvent this problem in this study we used available immunoinformatics approaches for the purpose to prioritize potential vaccine candidates against covid-19 considering their ease of use in experimental investigations bearing in mind the wide immunological applications of peptide vaccines only highly antigenic virulent conserved and non-allergic epitopes targeted by both b and t-cells were disclosed a multi-epitope peptide was constructed and an appropriate adjuvant was added to allow suitable delivery and efficient immune processing of the epitopes these promising computational findings might deliver preliminary epitopes set for a vaccine against the covid-19 notwithstanding the experimental testing in appropriate animal models to unravel real effectiveness meanwhile probable prevention discussed in this study for homo sapiens is to avoid becoming a reason for the extinction of various species either by hunting andor over utilizing other mammals as this may be a reason for resistance both from microbes and other animal species of this kingdom there must be strategic studies keeping in view the advancements in defense mechanism of avian and avian related microbes avenging humans preventive use of animals or avian in human diet and avoiding hunting can be preventive options for self-defense in this connection andor maintenance of a balanced ecosystem should be reinvestigated no conflict of interest was reported by the authors sajjad ahmad conceptualization methodology writing- original draft preparation visualization

around the world have been infected with a virus that has bafed scientists public health ofcials and governments initial cases in the middle-east were reported to the world health organisations global outbreak alert and response network set up to detect epidemics and other public health emergencies te type of virus is known a novel coronavirus a species of the virus behind the common cold but its origins are still a mystery tis new virus is currently moving slowly but it was a coronavirus that caused the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pandemic which killed 774 people so scientists who work on controlling the spread of new infections are on full alert one of them is eric snijder professor of molecular virology at leiden university medical center in the netherlands who has been studying coronaviruses for more than 25 years in october 2012 his team identifed the genome properties of this emerging strain it is now collaborating with an international group of labs in the hope of identifying compounds that may inhibit the viruss replication te collaboration is part of the european project silver a drug design program to tackle emerging diseases caused by rna viruses such as the new coronavirus snijders work represents the initial action taken when a new infection emerges be it a new subtype of infuenza such as h1n1 swine fu or a new coronavirus understanding the biology of the virus and estimating the threat it poses is crucial but the frst step is to fnd the virus using global monitoring and surveillance systems te who response network consists of 140 laboratories in 110 un member states recognized as national infuenza centres john mccauley is director of the who infuenza centre at the national institute for medical research in london one of six that regularly analyses signifcant fu viruses seen in the population as well as other emerging viruses which may be cause for concern if the prevalence of new infuenza strains increases it might indicate that the world is at increased risk of an infuenza epidemic  says mccauley global and domestic surveillance in the us is carried out by scientists at the centers for disease control and prevention cdc whose labs in atlanta are part of the who network constant communication is needed between centers to identify whether viruses recorded in diferent countries share characteristics once a threat has been identifed potential treatments must be trialed quickly and a pandemic preparedness plan put into action tis is part of the remit of anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid in bethesda maryland we need to understand the pathogenesis of the virus and how it may mutate and become highly transmissible to cause a pandemic  says fauci his lab then starts testing drugs and vaccines to stop the virus in its tracks we collaborate with industry and run clinical trials for new vaccines to determine the right dose if its safe if its efective especially in vulnerable members of the population  he says in 2009 as soon as h1n1 became clear we immediately went into action to develop a vaccine and tested the virus for sensitivity to drugs we already have such as tamifu -fortunately it was sensitive  he says identifying efective drugs helps buy time from a public health perspective as developing a vaccine currently takes about six months during this waiting game another feld -infectious disease modeling -comes into play to predict and mitigate the extent to which a virus will spread the modeling and economics unit at the uk health protection agency hpa was among those responsible for modeling outcomes for the 2009 h1n1 pandemic we run through diferent control scenarios such as the use of vaccines or anti-virals and see what may happen to the epidemic  says edmunds te aim is to gauge the trajectory of an infection and the efect of any actions including economical and political control measures such as travel restrictions and school closures models use characteristics like pathogenicity of the virus how likely it is to cause an infection to predict its spread but these days can also use current information on cases and timings to model epidemics in real-time a technique known as nowcasting  we use many diferent data sources and patch them together to get a glimpse of how many cases there really have been  edmunds says for those wanting to get into modeling it helps to have a diverse skill set you need a range of people and skills to handle this you need to understand biology statistics computer programming economics and bioinformatics an ability to work efectively with others is also vital says edmunds who sits on the scientifc pandemic infuenza spi committee alongside other modelers virologists and experts in risk management behavioural sciences and diagnostics together they feed information to the government to guide policy and mobilize resources infuencing policy decisions is not a role which always sits well with scientists especially under the time pressures of dealing with the spread of dangerous viruses anyone that can provide clear information and communicate the risk has the power to lead a response  says david heymann head of the centre for global health security at chatham house and chair of the uk health protection agency a particularly contentious problem is prioritising who should receive medicines frst including chemoprophylaxis -where drugs are used before infection to avoid people getting the disease during h1n1 the uk department of health and the hpa made the decision to treat contacts of patients prophylactically to slow down the spread of the virus  says heymann despite the time needed for their development the most desirable response to every pandemic is a vaccine tis involves collaboration between governmentrun organizations and industry kanta subbarao who leads the emerging respiratory viruses section at the nihs laboratory of infectious diseases in bethesda collaborates with biotech company medimmune to develop vaccines against infuenza strains that show pandemic potential we share our data in presentations and publications -this becomes part of the body of information that informs further decision making in the government and pharma  subbarao says pharmaceutical companies instigate their own pandemic preparedness plans and played an integral role during the h1n1 pandemic for instance glaxosmithkline set aside two million eggs for vaccine production as hen eggs are traditionally used to incubate the virus working with highly contagious pathogens comes with risk we have to work in a way that minimizes the risk of infection by using high containment conditions such as safety cabinets with gloved ports negative pressure and use of flters to trap viruses mccauley says tis type of research is also extremely controversial and the potential for viruses to become transmissible from animals to humans in the future -the study of which is seen as an important part of pandemic preparedness -notoriously led to a year-long moratorium on this type of research from january 2012 tese issues are among those considered by the newly-established centre for global health policy at the university of sussex uk safeguards should be in place to minimize the risk of accidental or deliberate misuse of research on deadly strains of infuenza viruses says center director stefan elbe for many immunologists working to reduce pandemics the ultimate goal is a universal fu vaccine we want to make a vaccine that produces a response to a section of the infuenza virus that doesnt change from pandemic to pandemic says fauci such a vaccine if administered every 5 to 8 years throughout the population could prevent a pandemic altogether of course it wont tackle the problem of emerging infections such as sars and the current coronavirus but its a step in the right direction to fght infuenza which has seen the biggest pandemics to date its going to take several years to get there says fauci but were starting to see the frst glimmers of success  nature editorial staf have no responsibility for content manufacturing the flumist influenza vaccine at medimmune dr helen sabzevari has been in the feld of immunotherapy since its infancy working to harness the bodys own immune system to treat cancer as she was doing her frst postdoc at scripps research institute in san diego sabzevari realised that there was a disconnect between scientists working in her own feld of cancer immunotherapy and those working on autoimmunity diseases normally these two diseases are opposite sides of the coin  she says autoimmunity is over-activity of the function of immune cells but with cancer there is a quiescence of the immune system in my opinion it was really important to understand both sides sabzevari ignored the advice of mentors who had already seen her career progress in immunotherapy and decided on a senior postdoc in the feld of autoimmunity in doing so she hoped she might fnd a way to use the mechanisms that cause the immune system to over-react in autoimmune diseases to kick-start the same cells which dont respond to cancer te decision paid of sabzevari spent almost 10 years researching cancer vaccines at the national institutes of health before moving to pharma company emd-serono where she leads their immuno-oncolgy research using the bodys own defences to attack cancer cells should lead to less toxic treatments for patients says sabzevari with some of the advances that have been made the patient can remain on the treatment for much longer periods of time with a better lifestyle sabzevari is also keen to build bridges between academia and industry to hasten the availability of possible treatments to this end she has set up a programme at emd-serono which allows postdocs to spend two or three years in industry before returning to academia if they wish ultimately for sabzevari and her colleagues the aim is to see their fndings get to the clinic as quickly as possible every day we see patients and we see families that lose people  she says tis is not about me this is not about my

coronavirus jiuyang xu wenxu jia pengfei wang senyan zhang xuanling shi xinquan wang linqi zhang   the rapid emergence and dissemination of infectious diseases has taken a heavy toll on humans since the beginning of the twenty-first century one of the most well-known examples was the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in the winter of 2002 and 2003 caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov 12 in distinct contrast to the mild human coronaviruses hcov-229e 3 hcov-oc43 4 hcov-nl63 5 and hcov-hku1 6 infection with sars-cov frequently resulted in severe symptoms including fever dry cough shortness of breath and pneumonia transmission of sars-cov was primarily from person to person and most cases occurred in health care settings lacking adequate infection control precautions 2 the sars outbreak had severe consequences in 29 countries and regions infecting 8096 people worldwide with a fatality rate of approximately 10 7 there are still no vaccines or therapeutics specific to sars-cov available 16 years after the sars outbreak it is not hard to imagine how catastrophic it would be if sars-cov were to hit the human community again while sars-cov remains a mystery and a loose cannon another novel coronavirus emerged in saudi arabia in 2012 later known as the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 8 the fatality rate of mers-cov infection is approximately 354 and new cases as well as associated deaths continue to arise to date 9 despite that most cases have been attributed to human-to-human transmission mers-cov does not appear to transmit efficiently among humans unless there is close contact the exact source of mers-cov and its routes of transmission to humans still remain uncertain dromedary camels are believed to be the animal reservoir for mers-cov because isolates from camels are almost identical to those from human and that many domestic camels are seropositive for mers-cov reviewed in 1011 furthermore current evidence strongly suggests that bats are the original source for mers-cov as many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to mers-cov originate in bats including batcov-hku4 batcov-hku5 and other mers-related coronaviruses 1215 the batcov-hku4 was also shown to be able to engage the cellular receptor of mers-cov adding evidence to the bat origin theory 16 however there has not yet been direct evidence for isolating mers-cov from bats reviewed in 101117 great efforts have been made to develop preventive and therapeutic interventions against mers-cov infection in particular monoclonal antibodies and vaccines targeting the spike glycoprotein are major areas of focus due to its critical role in mediating viral entry and its potential in inducing protective antibody responses in infected individuals so far more than twenty monoclonal antibodies with nanomolar neutralizing activities have been reported and many vaccine candidates are underway in preclinical and clinical studies in this review we aim to capture the current advances and discuss possible strategies to translate these discoveries into an ultimate medical intervention against mers-cov infection mers-cov belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family 18 it is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus with a helical capsid structure figure 1a the genome of mers-cov is around 30 kb 30119nt long and encodes 4 structural proteins spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid and 16 nonstructural proteins figure 1c 13 like other coronaviruses the mers-cov uses its spike s glycoprotein to interact with cellular receptors and enter into the target cell 1922 as a unique structural component of the virion membrane the s glycoprotein assembles into trimers and forms large protruding spikes on the surface of the virion 20 the s glycoprotein is a typical type i membrane glycoprotein consisting of a globular s1 domain at the n-terminal followed by a membrane-proximal s2 domain and a transmembrane tm domain 21 the s1 domain mediates viral attachment and contains the rbd receptor binding domain which determines the host range and cellular tropism for mers-cov 2325 similar to other coronaviruses the s2 domain of mers-cov mediating membrane fusion contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide fp at the n-terminus as well as two heptad repeats designated as hr1 and hr2 figure 1c 26 through co-purification with the mers-cov s1 domain raj and colleagues identified that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 functions as a cellular receptor for mers-cov 27

 the mers-cov virion enters the host airway cells in the respiratory tract through fusion with either the plasma or endosomal membrane 19 binding between rbd and the cell receptor triggers a cascade of conformational changes that lead to the formation of a pre-hairpin intermediate of s2 in which the hydrophobic hr1 is exposed and allows the fusion peptide to insert into the target cell membrane this transient s2 intermediate then refolds with hr2 into a stabilized trimer of hairpins also called six-helix bundle structure 6-hb which brings the target cell membrane into close proximity of the viral envelope resulting in the completion of the fusion process and initiation of the virus life cycle 21 figure 1b structure-based design of various peptides able to block the formation of 6-hb have demonstrated potent inhibition on mers-cov replication and spike-mediated cellcell fusion showing great promise for further development into effective viral fusion inhibitors for treating mers-cov infection 262830 among them the peptide ek1 is effective to multiple human coronaviruses apart from mers-cov and therefore serves as a potential pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor 30 recently structural studies on the prefusion state spike protein of mers-cov and sars-cov have provided more insights into the spike-mediated membrane fusion process 3134 the mers-cov spike protein trimerizes and folds into a metastable prefusion conformation on the virion surface in which three s1 domains fold into a steady trimer structure and sit on top to stabilize the coiled s2 domains figure 2ab we and others have identified that the rbd of sars-cov and mers-cov can be found either buried down position or exposed up position in the spike trimer structure 313335 the two conformational states of rbd may have distinct roles during receptor binding and membrane fusion only the rbds in up position but not those in down position can bind to the cell receptor dpp4 figure 2cd great steric clash was observed between dpp4 and neighboring spike protomers when we mapped it to the rbd in down position figure 2cd transformation of the rbd from the buried to the exposed state is therefore a prerequisite for receptor binding figure 2gh on the other hand this conformational change also seems to open up the stable cap structure sitting above the s2 cores figure 2ef this may lead to disassociation of s1 trimer and exposure of the fusion apparatus triggering the membrane fusion process

 to gain a better understanding of mers-cov interaction with cellular receptors at atomic levels we and others have determined the crystal structure of mers-cov rbd bound to the extracellular domain of its cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 2324 we showed that mers-cov rbd consists of a core and a receptor binding subdomain mers-cov rbd and the related sars-cov rbd share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains but are notably divergent in the receptor binding subdomains 36 the receptor binding subdomain of mers-cov rbd directly interacts with blades 4 and 5 of dpp4 propeller instead of its intrinsic hydrolase domain the interface consists of a buried surface of 2550 2 involving 14 residues in receptor binding subdomain interacting with 15 residues in dpp4 the actual binding forces are mediated through two major binding patches patch 1 represents 49 of buried surface and forms between the c-terminal end of the long loop connecting the 6 and 7 strands and blade 4 of dpp4 patch 2 occupies 51 of buried surface and forms a slightly concaved outer surface at the far end of the mers-cov receptor binding subdomain and a linker containing a short helix between blade 4 and blade 5 of dpp4 the concaved outer surface is made by the short 6 strand c-terminal parts of 5 and 7 strands n-terminal part of 8 strand and the 5-6 linking loop it is hoped that better understanding of the atomic details of the spike glycoprotein as well as the interface between mers-cov rbd and dpp4 will provide the structural basis for rational design and development of therapeutics and vaccines against mers-cov infection neutralizing antibodies are a major component of protective immunity against viral infection in humans polyclonal by nature the antibody response in vivo mobilizes a dynamic and complex mixture of monoclonal antibodies mabs that work in concert to target various antigenic domains on the viral envelope glycoprotein identifying the neutralizing mabs that constitute the neutralizing activity of polyclonal response and their recognized antigenic domains has therefore become the first crucial step towards gaining a better understanding of the protective antibody response developing clinical intervention methods and designing immunogens capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies great achievements have been made in the isolation of neutralizing mabs in the past few years using various technology platforms figure 3 up till now more than 20 mabs most of which are human or humanized antibodies have been described by scientists from all over the world these antibodies are listed in chronological order of publication in table 1 together with their unique biochemical and antiviral properties against mers-cov infection observed in cell culture and experimental animal models


 it is apparent that the single chain fragment variable scfv library approach allows rapid discovery of mab without time constraints from immunizing experimental animals or approaching convalescent individuals of mers-cov infection the earliest mabs reported in 2014 were identified through screening non-immune human scfv libraries with the ectodomain of s glycoprotein mab 3b11 40 or soluble rbd from s glycoprotein mers-4 mers-27 and the m336 panel 3742 as bait protein figure 3a these antibodies all demonstrated high neutralizing activities and therefore were widely used as reference antibodies in later studies antibodies have also been generated from immunized animals figure 3b several groups have reported mabs isolated from either wild-type inbred mice or transgenic mice expressing human antibody-variable heavy chains and  light chains mersmab-1 known as hms-1 after humanization was isolated from mice immunized subcutaneously with chimeric s1-fc 4748 the mabs 2e6 and 4c2 humanized form 4c2 h were isolated in mice immunized with recombinant rbd produced in insect cells 55 furthermore two human-like mabs regn3048 and regn3051 were directly cloned from transgenic mice expressing human versions of the antibody after immunization with dna encoding s glycoprotein and purified recombinant s glycoprotein 51 both mabs have been tested in humanized mice models and in non-human primates 5152 the authors indicated that the advantages of their system not only lay in the human component of their antibodies but also in the quick speed associated with isolation and production since no humanization or optimization step was required currently regn3048 and regn3051 have entered phase i clinical trials most of the mabs reported so far target the rbd region of s glycoprotein but rbd does not seem to be the only target for anti-mers-cov antibody responses recently a mab targeting the s1 n-terminus domain ntd region which does not contain rbd was isolated from mice immunized with s glycoprotein 57 this antibody 5f9 was shown to successfully block virus entry in cell culture models and the efficacy was comparable to other mabs in ic50 further the mab panel d12 f11 g2 and g4 were generated by priming mice with dna encoding the full-length s glycoprotein and boosting them with s1 protein among them are two mabs that target the non-rbd s1 mab g2 and s2 region mab g4 respectively 49 these non-rbd-binding antibodies potently neutralized pseudo- and live mers-cov in cell culture and were also protective in mouse models 4950 together the development of these antibodies elucidates that rbd may not be the single target for anti-viral antibody response more studies are needed to elaborate the detailed mechanisms for these antibodies 
apart from the traditional approach of isolating mabs from immunized mice several groups have turned to larger animal models for antibody isolation one group immunized rhesus macaques with combined dna and protein vaccines and isolated a panel of mabs including jc57-11 jc57-13 jc57-14 and fib-h1 targeting both rbd and non-rbd s1 region of the s glycoprotein all with potent neutralizing activities 50 another group immunized llama with recombinant rbd and screened the nanobody library for high-affinity single heavy chain antibody nanobody against rbd the humanized form nbms10-fc was constructed by combining the variable domain of the nanobody with the human constant fc domain and it was shown to protect mice from lethal mers-cov challenge 60 similarly stalin et al isolated a nanobody targeting rbd from camels immunized with mva encoding s glycoprotein the humanized form hcab-83 has high binding affinity to s protein and potent neutralizing activities to live virus 61 these nanobody-derived mabs are smaller in molecular weight and more stable than traditional antibodies and may provide a new option for future antibody isolation
 
in terms of closeness to authentic human antibodies no approach can compete with those based on direct b cell cloning from convalescent individuals one such mab lca60 was isolated from memory b cells of human survivors of mers-cov infection and was among the most potent mabs reported in neutralizing pseudo- and live viruses 53 more mabs isolated from human survivors were described as more convalescent blood samples became available including mca1 56 cdc-c2 cdc-c5 cdc-a2 cdc-a10 50 mers-gd27 and mers-gd33 5859 figure 3c all with potent neutralizing activities against mers-cov the mabs lca60 cdc-c2 mca1 and mers-gd27 were also tested to be protective in animal models as mers-cov research progressed quickly in the past few years many mabs have been tested for prophylactic or therapeutic protection efficacy in human dpp4 transgenic  transduced mice models and a few have entered large animal model trials such as in rabbits or non-human primates nhps however as different animal models were established among labs worldwide with slightly different evaluation end points it is difficult to make a direct comparison among these mabs this is also true for in vitro evaluation of neutralizing activities  since different cell lines pseudo-viruses and neutralizing assay techniques are utilized the published ic50 values can only serve as indirect reference for comparison head to head comparison in the same experimental system would be required to identify the most protective mab or combination of mabs against mers-cov infection in order to proceed to clinical trials we and others have carried out structural studies of mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in complex with mers-rbd to understand neutralizing mechanism at atomic levels figure 4 based on the epitopes revealed by structural studies mers-cov antibodies targeting rbd can be classified into three groups figure 4b table 1

 the first group consists of antibodies mers-27 d12 4c2 and jc57-14 which interact with the c-terminal segment of the 6-7 loop and 7 strand of rbd by both heavy and light chains figure 4b 38495055 their common epitopes on the rbd include residues val527 ser528 ile529 val530 pro531 ser532 trp535 glu536 and asp539 in the 6-7 loop the residues trp535 glu536 and asp539 also happen to be within the dpp4-binding site patch 1 of mers-cov rbd 23 mediating interaction with lys267 and the carbohydrate moiety linked to asn229 of dpp4 38 therefore the group 1 antibodies would directly compete with dpp4 in binding to rbd by interfering with both proteinprotein and proteincarbohydrate interactions between rbd and dpp4 structural super-impositions also showed that these four antibodies and dpp4 would have steric clashes between the variable domain of the heavy chain and the propeller domain of dpp4 if they simultaneously bind to rbd figure 4c the second group consists of antibodies m336 mca1 cdc2-c2 and mers-gd27 which interact with the 5-8 strands 5-6 loop and 6-7 loop in rbd mainly by the heavy chain figure 4b 43505658 their common epitope consists of pheleu506 asp510 trp535 glu536 asp539 tyr540 tyr541 arg542 and trp553 although antibodies in both group 1 and group 2 share the binding residues trp535 glu536 and asp539 their approaching angles to the rbd are significantly different as shown in figure 4c the approaching angle of group 2 antibodies is closer to that of dpp4 by rotating approximately 90 degrees anti-clockwise from that of group 1 antibodies thereby generating more steric clashes with dpp4 this is also evidenced by a larger overlap between the common epitope of group 2 antibodies and dpp4-binding site on rbd 23 as a representative of group 2 antibodies m336 exhibits very potent neutralizing activity by not only mimicking critical interactions between rbd and dpp4 but also adopting an approaching angle similar to that of dpp4 figure 4c the third group consists of antibody mers-4 and its variant mers-4v2 with four residue replacements in the hcdr3 figure 4b 39 by structural determination it was shown that mers-4 fab and mers-4v2 scfv share the same mode of binding to the rbd figure 4b 39 analysis of the rbdmers-4v2 complex structure showed that the antibody contacts with the 5-6 6-7 and 7-8 loops of the receptor-binding subdomain in rbd 39 the epitope involves leu507 ser508 gln516 asn519 asn521 gln522 tyr523 pro525 lys543 leu545 and gly550 39 to be note the mers-4 epitope has no overlap with dpp4-binding site figure 4c by approaching the rbd outside the dpp4-binding site mers-4 recognizes a unique epitope different from all previously reported rbd-targeting antibodies comparisons of rbd in dpp4-bound and mers-4-bound states revealed that binding of mers-4 induces or fixes the 5-6 loop into a conformation in which it folds into a shallow groove on the rbd interface critical for accommodating a short helix of dpp4 thereby indirectly disrupting the interaction between rbd and dpp4 figure 4c such different epitope and mechanism enable mers-4 to synergize with other antibodies including rbd-targeting mers-27 and m336 in neutralization which provides valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against mers-cov infection 39 in addition to the aforementioned ten antibodies targeting rbd the near atomic resolution cryo-em structures of the trimeric mers-cov spike and its complex with antibody g4 were also determined figure 4d 33 g4 is the first reported s2-targeting antibody and its epitope consists of a glycosylated solvent-exposed loop residing in a connector domain between the hr1 and hr2 of the s2 subunit in the unbound spike trimer structure this loop is largely disordered whereas it extends out from two -strands and is surrounded by all six cdrs complementarity determining regions of the mab g4 upon antibody recognition figure 4e the specific spike-g4 interaction may stabilize the loop and further impede conformational changes of s2 subunit essential for membrane fusion after dpp4 binding the binding epitope for g4 in s2 subunit is more conserved than rbd among mers-cov isolates shedding light on g4 as a potential broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody for mers-cov yet this loop between hr1 and hr2 is variable in sequence and length among different viruses even in lineage c betacoronaviruses 33 limiting its application to other coronaviruses in terms of pan-coronavirus medical countermeasures mcms the recently developed fusion inhibitor peptide ek1 is a potential candidate the peptide ek1 was designed to target the more conserved hr1 region of the s2 stem and was shown to block cellcell fusion induced by spike protein from multiple human coronaviruses 30 in general most reported mers-cov neutralizing antibodies recognize the rbd in the s1 subunit and these antibodies are highly potent in neutralization these facts show that the rbd in the s1 subunit is a major vulnerable site for antibody recognition and neutralization to be note the rbd is also the region where most naturally occurring mutations of the s glycoprotein occur currently the comprehensively studied antibodies targeting the non-rbd region of the spike glycoprotein also include mab 5f9 targeting the n-terminal domain ntd of the s1 subunit 57 as well as mabs g2 cdc2-a2 cdc2-a10 jc57-13 and fib-h1 targeting the non-rbd region of the s1 subunit 3350 however the detailed epitopes and specific mechanisms are still unclear for these antibodies we expect that more antibodies with new neutralizing epitopes andor mechanisms would be important for the combined use of antibodies against mers-cov infection although monoclonal antibodies show promising anti-viral effects in both cell culture and animal models against mers-cov infection their roles are still limited in large-scale disease prevention in mers-cov high risk areas as the therapeutic window is generally narrow for mabs and mass-scale production is time- and resource-consuming vaccines still remain the best choice for mers-cov prevention given its critical role in mediating viral entry and as major targets for neutralizing antibodies s glycoprotein and its rbd have become the prime targets for mers-cov immunogen design and vaccine development various approaches have been applied and more than twenty vaccine candidates have been reported in the past few years including vaccines based on inactivated virions 6263 virus-like particles 64 recombinant viral vectors 6580 dna 498182 recombinant protein subunits 33498392 and nanoparticles 809394 table 2 summarizes the critical features of these approaches and their protective potentials in experimental animal models

 up till now only two vaccine candidates gls-5300 and mers001 have entered human clinical trials the vaccine gls-5300 was the first to be tested in healthy human volunteers it is a dna plasmid encoding the mers-cov s glycoprotein requiring two-to-three injections delivered by electroporation 81 the phase i clinical trial was started in 2016 at the walter reed army institute and another phase iii clinical trial is being conducted in korea to test dosage safety and immunogenicity another vaccine candidate mers001 is a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus chadox1 containing the mers-cov s glycoprotein antigen 7071 this vaccine only requires one-time administration of 510951010 virus particles via intramuscular route and the local adverse events as well as immunogenicity will be evaluated in the phase i clinical trial conducted at the university of oxford in addition one more candidate vaccine has been tested in dromedary camels either for potential human use or straight into veterinary use it explores a modified vaccinia virus ankara mva as a vector to express mers-cov s glycoprotein 67 the regimen involves immunization through intranasal as well as intramuscular routes twice at a 4-week interval the vaccinated camels demonstrated a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral rna transcripts in vaccinated animals upon mers-cov challenge protection against mers-cov infection correlated with the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to mers-cov as mva has established a reasonably good safety profile in humans and induced desirable protective immunity in camels it represents one of the potential candidates to be further evaluated in humans in the near future the remaining vaccine candidates are all in the stages of preclinical or laboratory development and invariably target the s glycoprotein or rbd critical for viral entry table 2 vaccines based on inactivated 6263 or virus-like particles 64 have historical precedence in inducing protective immune responses in humans whether the same strategies are applicable to mers-cov requires further studies particularly when it comes to possible safety concerns 62 apart from mers001 and the mva-based vaccine tested in dromedary camels other vector-based approaches are also being actively pursued including adenovirus 6869727380 measles virus 7475 veev replicon particle 7677 vesicular stomatitis virus 78 and rabies virus 79 all recombinant viruses encoding the mers-cov s or s1 antigen demonstrated strong immunogenicity in mice or non-human primate models and some were shown to confer protection in mers-cov challenge mouse models table 2 however concerns remain regarding the pre-existing immunity against these viral vectors from natural infection because it would diminish the vaccine potency 95 to overcome the issue of pre-existing immunity against human adenoviruses while preserving their advantages such as high yields and strong immunogenicity rare serotypes of chimpanzee adenovirus of low human seroprevalence may be adopted as viral vectors 7073 our group recently developed a vaccine candidate with replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus c68 adc68 vector expressing full length mers-cov s glycoprotein seroprevalence of adc68 is around 2 in human population much lower than that of the commonly used human adenovirus 5 huad5 vector 60 9697 one intra-nasal administration of 2  109 viral particles completely protected human dpp4 knock-in hdpp4-ki mice from lethal mers-cov challenge and passive transfer of adc68-s immune sera conferred survival advantage in lethal challenge mouse models 73 further the safety profiles of these vectors have yet to be extensively tested in humans recently hashem and colleagues showed that the adenovirus-based s1 vaccine may pose potential safety concerns because it may induce pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage in a mers-cov challenge mouse model regardless of the its full protection upon lethal viral infection they also showed that the pulmonary pathology can be mitigated by incorporating cd40l an immune-modulator therefore potential molecular adjuvant into the recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine 72 whether this vaccine-associated pathology is related to residual infectious viruses or unbalanced immune responses awaits further investigation with this in mind all future mers-cov vaccine candidate designs should take extra cautions on safety evaluation furthermore recombinant-protein-based vaccines are widely pursued strategies to solubilize the mers-cov s glycoprotein in order to form stable immunogens include forming nanoparticles and using soluble protein truncations in particular both nanoparticles formed with full length mers-cov s glycoprotein 9394 and subunit rbd-based vaccines 8390 have been shown to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and to protect mice when challenged with mers-cov one rbd subunit vaccine also conferred protection in rhesus macaques 91 this indicates that rbd alone as antigen may be sufficient for protective immunity to develop against the virus along with the finding that mab targeting ntd is able to neutralize mers-cov lan et al showed that three doses of intramuscularly administered recombinant ntd protein also induced protective immunity against live mers-cov in human dpp4 transduced mouse model ad5-hdpp4 mice 92 more recently with the structural insights into the spike glycoprotein pallesen et al developed a prefusion-stabilized s trimer vaccine by substituting proline residues into the s2 domain 33 the introduction of proline disfavours the refolding of the linker between hr1 and the central helix thus preventing the transition of spike into the post-fusion state this rationally designed antigen mers s-2p was shown to induce broader and more potent neutralizing activity than wild type spike trimer protein 33 finally a prime-boost strategy based on a full-length s glycoprotein dna vaccine followed by an s1-glycoprotein boost was able to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies and confer protection against the clinical severity of diseases in non-human primate models 49 compared with the protein-only regimen the combination of dna and protein induced a more functionally diverse antibody repertoire and stronger th1 immune response it was suggested that the native s glycoprotein conformation formed on the cell surface after dna vaccination helped induce more diverse antibodies against mers-cov as summarized in table 2 most of the aforementioned strategies require multiple immunizations which may pose additional logistic hurdles at the end point use it is unclear whether these immunization strategies were empirically designed or due to relatively poor immunogenicity of candidate vaccines for practical and compliant purposes a single immunization with the highest immunogenicity in animals and humans will be preferred the outbreak of mers-cov in saudi arabia in 2012 reminded us of the 2003 sars-cov outbreak in china despite the differences in geographic location epidemiology and immediate animal reservoirs these two viruses share remarkable similarity in causing severe respiratory syndrome leading to high fatality in humans and trigger serious public health concerns with the advent of modern techniques in virology immunology and vaccinology we have gained substantial insights into the biology of mers-cov and its pathogenesis with unprecedented speed and accuracy as summarized in the current review tremendous progress has been made in understanding 1 the entry process of mers-cov into target cells 2 the structure and function of s glycoprotein and cellular receptor dpp4 in mediating viral entry 3 antibody response during natural infection and isolation of broad and potent neutralizing mabs and 4 design and development of vaccine candidates using various innovative technologies however our progress in translating these discoveries into clinical application has been slow only two vaccine candidates and one mab panel have entered phase i clinical trials for safety ironically no vaccines and treatment strategies have been approved for sars-cov infection even after more than a decade of outbreak we could not imagine how catastrophic it would be should sars-cov hit again or mers-cov continues to probe and gain strong capacity in transmission to and among humans we are facing a difficult predicament when it comes to public health challenges in the new era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases on one hand the human population is becoming ever mobile and exposed to an increasing number of pathogens on the other hand translating basic discoveries into preventative and treatment applications has been exceedingly slow among many plausible reasons a lack of incentives in financial returns perhaps stands the tallest the deadlock is not just happening to mers-cov and sars-cov but also to many other infectious pathogens such as ebola marburg lassa highly pathogenic avian influenza hiv-1 and so on fundamental and drastic changes have to be made in the entire research and development system before we can truly prepare and position ourselves ahead of deadly epidemic and pandemic only then can our speed and accuracy in basic discovery be timely translated into clinical and public health needs the time to act is now  vaccines for emerging viral diseases adam dezure barney graham s barry bloom r paul-henri lambert   infectious diseases continue to plague mankind and evolve to keep pace with the efforts to control them sir william osler captured the ongoing fear of infectious pathogens when he said humanity has but three great enemies fever famine and war of these by far the greatest by far the most terrible is fever despite the significant impact of antimicrobials and vaccines on public health there has only been one major human pathogen eradicatedvariola virus the agent of smallpox in its place have been a series of new and reemerging microbes responsible for isolated infections regional outbreaks and global pandemics bacterial fungal and parasitic pathogens have the capacity to cause widespread epidemics such as the black death caused by yersinia pestis in 14th century europe however bacteria fungi and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases focusing on viruses a catalogue of newly discovered human pathogens from the beginning of the 20th century shows a predictable and nearly linear rate of new agents discovered over time1 however of the more than 100 virus families only 22 have been associated with human infections a number that seems to have plateaued1 in this chapter we will concentrate on vaccines for emerging viral diseases
 experiences over the last 3 decades with hiv sars and ebola have taught us the potential consequences of viral infectious threats on global health and economic and political stability emerging viral infections with pandemic potential can be chronic persistent or acute in nature they can be disseminated by respiratory droplet or other bodily fluids they can emerge from animal reservoirs and spread via insect vectors and can be precipitated by changes in climate animal habitats human population dynamics and other ecological events2 and they can emerge as a consequence of human activity in the context of deliberate viral modification as a form of biowarfare we are faced with important questions including what can be done to anticipate these events and how can we best prepare to intervene when new or changing viral threats arrive most current licensed antiviral vaccines utilize live-attenuated or whole-inactivated viruses although there are now a few examples of effective virus-like particle vlp vaccines in the setting of a new pandemic viral threat and without the advantage of a preexisting understanding of its pathogenesis growth or attenuating features it would be difficult to quickly develop traditional live-attenuated or whole-inactivated vaccine approaches due to uncertainty about the safety of attenuating mutations or the production of replication-competent virus in bulk therefore it is more likely that developing vaccines for emerging infections will involve new technologies some of which have not yet been licensed for human use using technologies that can provide a candidate vaccine based on information derived entirely from target gene sequences is safer and more expeditious than procedures requiring virus isolation and growth that require a high level of containment therefore even for virus families for which there are currently licensed vaccines additional approaches beyond live-attenuated and whole-inactivated products should also be pursued historically decades have elapsed between when a new virus is discovered and when a relevant vaccine becomes available for human use fig 281
 in the setting of an epidemic such protracted vaccine development timelines are incompatible with rapid deployment of a vaccine intervention and therefore not a practical consideration for immediate control of the outbreak in part because of the 2014 west african ebola outbreak emergence of new viral threats to public health are becoming more of a global concern and have more media and political visibility fortunately this is a time of remarkable technical advances in human monoclonal antibody discovery structure-guided antigen design and nucleic acid sequencingmaking rapid development of biologics more feasible therefore defining new approaches and pathways to efficiently deploy vaccine interventions for emerging infections is a priority for public health agencies commercial entities government officials and nonprofit organizations however the key to a rapid vaccine response is advanced preparation several steps are needed to improve preparedness for emerging viral infectious diseases these can be divided into 4 broad categories 1 surveillance and discovery 2 reagent assay and animal model development 3 vaccine design and product development and 4 manufacturing clinical evaluation and an appropriate regulatory framework depending on features of the virus structure transmission dynamics entry requirements tropism and replication strategy a vaccine approach should be proposed designed and evaluated in small animals for immunogenicity and protection against challenge manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business while emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign therefore in addition to new biological tools there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process3
 in this review we describe the vaccine development efforts for three distinct viruses that collectively capture many of the challenges faced when developing vaccines for emerging viral threats ebola a member of the filoviridae family is spread by body fluids and secretions with a relatively low attack rate but causes a systemic disease with high mortality chikungunya an alphavirus in the togaviridae family is transmitted by mosquito vectors with a high attack rate and causes a systemic disease with low mortality but high frequency of chronic disabling arthritis middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov a beta-coronavirus and member of the coronaviridae family is spread by respiratory droplets and causes a relatively high mortality in persons with underlying disease it has a reproductive rate r
0 of 1 for person-to-person spread but occasional super-spreaders can infect multiple people the mers reservoir dromedary camels will continue to be a source of new human infections ebola chikungunya and mers cov are representative infectious pathogens with pandemic potential use of new technologies to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of viral structure and pathogenesis has paved the way for rational vaccine design for each of these viruses herein we elaborate on the iterative path taken to develop and evaluate candidate vaccines for ebola chikungunya and mers cov and the factors that propel or delay progress we focus our discussions primarily on the candidate vaccines developed at the niaid vaccine research center not because they are necessarily the most promising or advanced but because we are more familiar with the events associated with their development and the factors impacting advancement and implementation ebola is a highly virulent pathogen from the family filoviridae ebolavirus is an enveloped negative-strand rna virus whose genome encodes 7 structural proteins including a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates viral entry into host cells4 the surface glycoprotein gp mediates viral attachment and entry and is the primary antigenic target for vaccine development five species of ebola have been identified including zaire the cause of the 2014 west african epidemic sudan bundibugyo tai forest and reston ebola virus disease evd was first recognized in two distinct outbreaks in the ebola river valley of the democratic republic of congo formerly zaire and in sudan in 19765 6 evd emerged again in 1994 in gabon and in 1995 in an outbreak involving 315 people in kikwit democratic republic of congo drc since then sporadic outbreaks have occurred in equatorial africa especially the drc republic of congo gabon uganda and sudan with fatality rates averaging over 507 8
 after an incubation period of 221 days onset of evd is manifested by fevers chills malaise and myalgias with onset of gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea vomiting and diarrhea by days 358 9 when fatal death typically occurs by days 712 and can be characterized by hypovolemic shock and multiorgan failure8 9 the disease is transmitted human-to-human through direct contact with infected bodily fluids through mucosal surfaces and breaks in the skin8
 in mar of 2014 guineas ministry of health was notified of a highly pathogenic febrile illness circulating in gueckedou and macenta an epidemiologic evaluation ensued and samples from hospitalized patients were sent to bsl4 labs in france and germany ebola was confirmed by either polymerase chain reaction pcr electron microscopy or from isolation in cell culture10 viral rna was extracted sequenced and compared to available ebola sequences in genbank enabling phylogenetic analysis an ebola strain was identified with 97 similarity to previously collected ebola strains in the drc and gabon in turn the outbreak was traced to a single index case a 2-year-old boy who died in dec 2013 in gueckedou the epidemic of evd that followed has accounted for more cases than all prior evd outbreaks combined as of jul 2015 over 28000 suspected and confirmed cases and more than 11000 deaths have been reported with the majority of cases occurring in the west african countries of guinea liberia and sierra leone11 the world health organization who declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern in aug of 2014 and as the outbreak emerged the international community responded with an unprecedented effort to accelerate ebola vaccine development12 prior to 2014 the largest single ebola outbreak was 425 infections leading to 224 deaths13
 the vaccine research center within the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases performed a series of phase i clinical trials between 2003 and 2009 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of gp antigen constructs these included a dna vaccine encoding a transmembrane-deleted secreted version of the glycoprotein a recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 rad5 vectored vaccine encoding the ebola gp with one amino acid mutation and subsequently a dna vaccine encoding the full-length wild-type wt gp14 15 16 these phase i studies showed the wt full-length gp was safe and well tolerated in parallel studies to define the immunological correlates of protection and optimal antigen delivery approaches were evaluated in nonhuman primates nhp in addition to the important role for antibodies targeting gp it was found that cd8 t cell-mediated immunity was found to be critical for vaccine efficacy in nhp17 it was also found that antivector immunity would diminish vaccine potency particularly for the induction of cd8 t cells because of the high seroprevalence of ad5 rare serotype adenovirus vectors were explored including human rad26 and rad35 vectors and chimpanzee-derived rad vectors18
 chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 3 abbreviated as chad3 or cad3 encoding the wild-type glycoproteins from both the ebola zaire and sudan species was ultimately chosen as the candidate vaccine vector because of its low seroprevalence and its similar potency and pattern of innate immune response induction to ad5 this vector was originally produced by okairos which is now owned by glaxosmithkline gsk vector potency comparable to rad5 was considered to be important for rapid induction of both antibody and cd8 t cells with a single dose this would facilitate use of the cad3-ebola gp vaccine in an outbreak setting using a ring vaccination strategy to achieve rapid short term protection for those at highest risk of infection both zaire and sudan gp were included in the initial vaccine to protect against both zaire and sudan the most common species responsible for evd this replication-defective vaccine now called cad3-ebo provided 100 protection to nonhuman primates 5 weeks following vaccination in an otherwise lethal ebola challenge model and partial protection 50 to lethal challenge 10 months following vaccination the cad3-ebo was also shown to effectively prime for a modified vaccinia virus ankara mva-vectored vaccine boost encoding the same glycoprotein inserts improving survival from lethal ebola challenge to 100 at 10-months postboost19 the combination of cad3-mva prime-boost produces a much higher magnitude response and might provide more durable protection to health care workers ambulance drivers burial workers and others with ongoing risk of ebola exposure the first quarter of 2015 was targeted for phase i clinical evaluation of cad3-ebo at the nih clinical center and a pre-investigational new drug ind application was submitted to that end in aug of 2013 however in response to the epidemic the nih fda irbs and others coordinated efforts to consolidate timelines an ind application was submitted to the fda on aug 15 2014 and a phase i trial began 18 days later the cad3-ebo vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic in early phase 1 testing of two doses 2  1010 and 2  1011 particle units pu and the day 28 postvaccination results were published 3 months later20 all vaccine recipients developed glycoprotein gp-specific antibodies however gp-specific antibody responses as well as gp-specific t cell responses were greater with the 2  1011 pu dosing antibody titers with the higher dose were in the range associated with protective immunity in the nhp challenge model the zaire gp antigen encoded by cad3 was derived from the original mayinga strain of ebola isolated in 1976 compared to strains circulating in west africa it differed in very few gp residues outside the glycan cap which is cleaved prior to virus entry mayinga was also more related genetically to the outbreak strain than the kikwit strain that had been used in the nhp challenge studies therefore the available cad3 ebola zaire construct was thought to be antigenically relevant to the outbreak strain and suitable for testing to directly address the west african crisis and to accelerate manufacturing timelines additional phase i studies of the cad3 vaccine in monovalent form encoding the gp from zaire not sudan species were performed in the united states united kingdom mali and switzerland at doses ranging from 1  1010 to 1  101121 these studies done in collaboration with gsk supported advancement of the monovalent vaccine into an on-going phase iiiii study in liberia nct02344407 as well as us evaluation of a prime-boost regimen consisting of cad3-ebo followed by mva-eboz to evaluate durable immune responses nct02408913 the monovalent cad3-eboz has also been evaluated as a prime for boosting with a recombinant mva vector provided by bavarian nordic expressing the gp from zaire sudan and marburg and n from tai forest at sites in the united kingdom and mali a similar vaccine approach using rad28 priming and mva boosting developed by crucell now owned by janssen as part of johnson  johnson has been evaluated in subsequent clinical trials
 in parallel with cad3-ebo development a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus rvsv vaccine expressing gp from ebola zaire kikwit strain showed promising results in preclinical nhp challenge models22 23 the vaccine was developed by the public health agency of canada licensed to bioprotection systems a subsidiary of newlink genetics and subsequently licensed to merck the donation of 800 vials of this vaccine by the canadian government to who enabled initial evaluation of this candidate vaccine in 150 people at doses ranging from 300000 to 50 million pfu in phase i trials in gabon kenya germany and switzerland although no life-threatening adverse events were observed there was evidence of unexpected viral seeding of joints and transient arthritis in addition to vaccine virus positive skin vesicles in some participants a lower dose of rvsv-zebov 300000 pfu im did not diminish the likelihood of rvsv infecting peripheral tissues thirteen of 51 participants developed arthritis and 2 participants developed cutaneous lymphocytic vasculitis with rvsv established as the etiology based on synovial fluid and skin lesion analysis24 25 the vaccine was immunogenic and all vaccine recipients evaluated developed gp-specific antibody responses26 an additional evaluation of this candidate vaccine in two phase i trials in the united states wrair and nih supported advancement of the vaccine at 20 million pfu dosing compared to 3 million pfu dosing 20 million pfu resulted in higher igg and neutralizing antibody titers27 the higher dose vaccine is currently under evaluation in the niaid-sponsored prevail trial in liberia the cdc-sponsored strive study in sierra leone and the who-sponsored ebola a suffit study in guinea notably the skin and joint complications were not seen during active follow-up of individuals in the united states or african studies interim results from the ebola a suffit phase iii trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of rvsv-zebov in an unblinded cluster-randomized trial in guinea are encouraging and consistent with vaccine efficacy the trial utilized a ring vaccination design in which individuals at high risk of infection contacts and contacts-of-contacts of a lab confirmed case of evd were randomized as a cluster to receive either immediate vaccination with rvsv-zebov or delayed vaccination 21 days later there were no cases of evd with symptom onset 10 days following randomization in the group receiving immediate vaccination 48 clusters with 2014 subjects whereas the authors reported 16 cases of evd in subjects randomized to delayed vaccination 42 clusters with 2380 subjects28
 the pathway to licensure of new vaccines requires evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy in clinical trials for infectious pathogens that emerge sporadically and with low incidence such as ebola the ability to perform randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded efficacy trials remains a limiting factor the hard fought decline in evd cases in west africa is welcome and will hopefully lead to complete control of the epidemic without rebound or reemergence however the decline will likely preclude efforts to evaluate vaccine efficacy of other vaccine candidates during this outbreak for the cad3-ebo vaccine it remains unknown if a path to licensure is feasible in the absence of human efficacy data regulators will need to consider if supportive evidence from preclinical nhp challenge models safety data in on-going human trials and use of alternative surrogate immunogenicity endpoints is adequate to move forward with licensing therefore several challenging questions remain for regulators and vaccine developers alike these include determining which ebola vaccines will be made available for the next ebola epidemic and what trial design will be used ie ring vaccination strategy with delay or community randomization a step-wedge design with staged vaccination or a placebo-controlled randomized study or whether the initial results from the recent trial will preclude further evaluation of experimental unlicensed products28 nonetheless several important lessons can be extracted from the recent development of ebola vaccine candidates perhaps the most important is that the rapid development and testing of candidate vaccines in 2014 and 2015 was made possible because of years of prior investment into the study of ebola basic virology and pathogenesis in part driven by biodefense concerns other factors that enabled accelerated vaccine development include 1 preexisting established animal models 2 preclinical data from nhp challenge studies 3 the presence of cgmp vaccine product and 4 global concern extensive media coverage and political visibility that helped foster coordination between funding agencies regulatory authorities governments clinical trial sites laboratories commercial partners and publishers chikungunya virus chikv is a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the family togaviridae transmitted primarily by aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes29 three chikv clades have been identified and include west african asian and eastcentralsouth african each sharing significant amino acid homology chikungunya infection manifests as abrupt onset of fever myalgias rash headache nausea and arthralgias with illness onset typically 37 days following viral transmission30 31 32 the hallmark arthritis of chikv infection can be relapsing incapacitating and may persist for months30 severe manifestations of chikungunya can include myocarditis hepatitis and neurologic complications including encephalitis33 and although rare deaths have occurred particularly in the elderly and infants there are currently no fda licensed vaccines or treatments specific for chikungunya chikv has an 118 kb single-stranded positive-sense rna genome that encodes 4 nonstructural proteins involved in virus replication nsp1-4 and 5 structural proteins including the capsid and envelope glycoproteins e1 and e230 32 34 the e1 glycoprotein mediates cell fusion and the e2 glycoprotein interacts with the host receptor the mature virion diameter is 70 nm and the external surface exhibits trimeric spikes consisting of 240 e2e1 heterodimers32
 chikungunya virus was discovered at the east african virology research institute in entebbe uganda now the uganda virology institute uvri and was isolated from a member of the makonde tribe in tanzania in the early 1950s chikv has been responsible for outbreaks in africa and asia since the 1960s31 chikv is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of africa where it exists as part of an enzootic cycle however intermittent epidemics emerge characterized by human-mosquito-human transmission with attack rates that can exceed 5032 chikv reemerged in 2005 in an epidemic infecting 272000 people across several islands in the indian ocean genetic mutations in the virus including a substitution a226v in the e1 glycoprotein that enhanced viral infectivity of the a albopticus vector contributed both to the 2005 epidemic as well as widespread dissemination of chikv into new and temperate climates34 35 the first case of autochthonous transmission in the americas was reported in 2013 and local transmission has now been reported in over 43 countries or territories in the americas a chikv epidemic continues in the caribbean and as of jul 2015 15 million suspected chikv cases have been reported in the caribbean central america south america mexico and the us the chikv in the americas is most similar to the asian strain and is almost exclusively transmitted by a aegypti an eastcentralsouth african ecsa strain has more recently been detected in brazil which may make adaptation to a albopictus more likely if this occurs broader spread into north america is possible chikv viremia peaks on the day of symptom onset with titers reaching 109 viral rna copiesml36 both neutralizing activity and induction of igg3 antibody isotype early in the course of infection are associated with lower risk of chronic disease and persistent arthralgias37 38 research to date supports an antibody-mediated mechanism of protection from chikv infection39 and passive protection was shown in an otherwise lethal mouse model of chikv infection following igg administration from nhps who had received a chikungunya virus-like particle vlp vaccine34
 several promising candidate vaccine platforms have been evaluated including formalin-inactivated chikv vaccines40 41 recombinant mva and measles vectored vaccines42 43 chimeric alphavirus vaccines44 insect cell-produced vlp vaccine candidates45 and dna vaccine candidates46 47 a live attenuated chikv vaccine was advanced into phase ii testing and induced neutralizing antibodies to chikv by day 28 in 98 of recipients but was also associated with arthralgias in 8 of subjects48 due to our familiarity with the limitations and obstacles for advancement of a candidate vaccine developed at the niaid vaccine research center we will focus the discussion primarily on a mammalian cell-produced vlp vaccine this candidate vaccine was evaluated in a phase i clinical trial and is currently being advanced into phase ii clinical testing to produce the vlp akahata and coworkers transfected 293t hek cells with expression vectors encoding c-e3-e2-6k-e1 proteins from the west african chikv strain 37997 electron microscopy revealed production of vlps with the same morphologic appearance as wild-type chikv characterized by a 65 nm external diameter 40 nm core diameter and a structure with e1 and e2 glycoproteins organized into 240 heterodimers and 80 glycoprotein spikes in preclinical assessment all nhps receiving this vlp developed neutralizing antibodies to both heterologous and homologous chikv strains in a challenge model all nhps were protected against viremia as well as the postinflammatory sequelae of infection when exposed to intravenous chikv challenge 15 weeks after vlp administration34
 the vlp vaccine candidate was found to be safe and immunogenic in a phase i dose-escalation clinical trial evaluating a dose range of 1040 g over a 3 dose regimen weeks 0 4 and 20 in 25 healthy adults neutralizing antibodies against an outbreak strain from the ecsa clade were identified in all participants 4 weeks following the second vaccination revealing both robust immunogenicity and evidence of cross-reactive neutralizing activity49
 several advantages of this vlp vaccine include its highly symmetric exterior that resembles wild-type virus induction of high titer neutralizing antibody safety profile as a nonreplicating candidate vaccine with low containment manufacturing factors contributing to the delay in advanced development of this vaccine include difficulty in establishing a commercial partnership resources needed for process development and scale-up and difficulties in establishing clinical trial infrastructure for defining efficacy and immune correlates of protection due to the ongoing chikungunya epidemic in the americas and the caribbean there is an opportunity to obtain an efficacy result in a field trial therefore advancing clinical evaluation of candidate vaccines should be a public health imperative if field trials are delayed until the outbreak has saturated the region and the disease becomes more sporadic it will be difficult to ever obtain an efficacy outcome or establish an immunological correlate of protection this will complicate achieving licensure for general use and is another example of how public options for manufacturing would facilitate the development of vaccines for emerging infectious diseases coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses with very large genomes 30 kb endemic human coronaviruses are widespread and include coronaviruses hcov-229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 which generally cause mild respiratory infections including the common cold however several features of coronaviruses allow adaptation to new hosts and ecological niches50 these include large rna genomes high frequency of rna recombination and infidelity of the rna-dependent rna polymerase following the 2002 emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov a highly pathogenic lineage b betacoronavirus concerns arose that novel coronaviruses could represent a major public health threat this was further validated by the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov
 the first case of mers cov was reported in 2012 in a 60-year-old male in saudi arabia with acute pneumonia who subsequently died from progressive pulmonary and renal failure50 the subsequent rapid international response to the emergence of mers cov included genomic sequencing development of diagnostic assays surveillance for a zoonotic reservoir development of animal models and evaluation of viral pathogenesis to enable rational design of candidate vaccines the complete genome sequence of the implicated coronavirus was rapidly identified and made available in genbank genomic sequencing enabled phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis and mers cov was identified as a lineage c betacoronavirus distinct from previously known human coronaviruses and most closely related to hku4 and hku5 coronaviruses previously isolated from bats50 51
 clinical presentation of mers cov can range from asymptomatic to a severe respiratory illness that culminates in death following an incubation period of 52 days 19147 days presenting symptoms can include fever cough and dyspnea rapid deterioration of respiratory status can occur within just a few days of symptom onset and fatality rates are estimated to be about 35 since 2012 there have been 1595 lab-confirmed cases of mers cov infection and at least 571 deaths globally52 this includes an outbreak of 186 individuals in south korea initiated by a single index case a man returning from a trip to saudi arabia the outbreak in seoul was primarily restricted to hospital settings where 5 individual super-spreaders accounted for the majority of infections of other patients and health care providers53
 mers cov expresses a membrane-anchored trimeric spike s protein that consists of a s1 subunit that engages the receptor on the host cell and a s2 subunit that mediates membrane fusion54 the receptor binding domain on s1 has served as the primary antigenic target for vaccine development similar to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 peptidase receptor used by sars cov the mers cov target cell receptor is cd26 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 which is a 766 amino acid type ii transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells of several organs including lung and kidney dpp4 has been shown to be a biomarker of il-13 expression in asthma and is associated with glycemic homeostasis and microvascular complications of diabetes55 56 transfection of human dpp4 into otherwise nonsusceptible cells from feline murine and canine species enables mers cov infection57 lu et al subsequently solved the crystal structure of the receptor binding domain of s1 in complex with cd2658
 comparative serologic studies emerged shortly after mers cov was first identified to look for zoonotic reservoirs evaluation of serum-specific igg targeting the receptor-binding s1 subunit was performed by protein microarray and confirmed by virus neutralization testing and revealed high-titer neutralizing antibodies were prevalent in camels59 experimental support for the camel as a zoonotic reservoir was performed by adney and coworkers who inoculated camels with mers cov the camels subsequently developed upper respiratory symptoms and showed evidence of upper respiratory tract viral shedding in nasal secretions for 7 days postinoculation60 evidence of zoonotic transmission from camel to humans was further supported from a patient in 2013 who died of mers cov following exposure to camels with rhinorrhea nasal swabs for both the patient and camels were positive for mers cov rna and subsequent genomic sequencing revealed the isolates to be identical61 however not all cases of mers cov infection have been linked to camel exposure additional studies are needed to further define transmission dynamics and intermediate hosts low herd immunity in humans a highly pathogenic virus and evidence of both zoonotic and human-to-human transmission suggest that outbreaks of mers cov will continue to occur and may have pandemic potential there are currently no fda approved vaccines for mers cov but previous vaccine development efforts for sars cov created a foundation for mers cov vaccine design the sars spike protein is similarly responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion and is the primary antigen target for neutralizing antibody and vaccine development62
 candidate mers cov vaccines also target the spike protein approaches have included subunit proteins dna and gene-based vectors a recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing the full length mers cov spike protein produced neutralizing antibody in immunized mice63 subsequently ma and coworkers focused on the receptor binding domain rbd of the mers cov spike protein to develop a subunit protein vaccine five different receptor binding domain fragments from s1 were individually fused with the fc of human igg and each was evaluated for receptor binding affinity antigenicity immunogenicity and neutralizing potential the s377-588-fc fragment that contains the stably folded rbd had the highest affinity for dpp4 and induced the highest titer neutralizing antibodies in both mice and immunized rabbits while minimizing exposure to nonneutralizing epitopes64 in addition two recombinant vaccine candidates have been developed using either a baculovirus-based expression system or a venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particle approach65 66
 potent neutralization was induced in mice and nhps following immunization with dna expressing the full-length spike protein followed by a boost with s1 subunit glycoprotein this strategy elicited responses against both rbd and non-rbd neutralizing epitopes which may decrease the chance of escape mutations this dna prime-protein boost regimen provided protection from computerized tomography ct defined pneumonia in a nhp viral challenge model67 this work highlights the importance of developing mabs against the vaccine target antigen in order to define mechanisms of viral neutralization protein structure and antigenicity to guide rational vaccine design a dna plasmid-based vaccine encoding full length consensus mers spike protein was constructed based on available s protein genomic sequences in the genbank-ncbi database the vaccine induced polyfunctional t cell and humoral responses in mice and nhps including antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice macaques and camels the vaccine also provided protection from pneumonia in a nhp viral challenge model68
 there are no clinical trial data yet for candidate mers cov vaccines mers cov is likely to continue to cause sporadic outbreaks fueled by camel exposure and the occasional super-spreading event however the relatively low r0 suggests that mers cov has a relatively low probability of causing a widespread pandemic therefore the target populations for a vaccine when available is not the general population but groups at high risk of exposure to animal reservoirs health care workers in endemic regions and possibly at-risk travelers with this relatively small market it will be difficult for commercial organizations to invest in mers cov vaccine development with such low incidence a field study to evaluate efficacy will be large and difficult to complete therefore questions again are raised about how to achieve advanced development and licensing of a vaccine for this type of emerging virus the activities needed to prepare for future pandemic viral threats include a broad spectrum of disciplines and skill sets ranging from logistics and communication to epidemiology and ecology clinical trials and highly technical biomedical research programs fortunately relatively recent technological advances have made the prospects of a comprehensive program to systematically prepare for emerging infectious diseases more feasible if done with forethought the development of such a program would strengthen existing health care programs build research infrastructure and significantly improve the status of global public health in particular we should take advantage of new technologies such as high throughput sequencing isolation of human monoclonal antibodies structural biology atomic-level antigen design molecular biology and vector biology these tools can provide the information needed for rapid achievement of optimal expression immunogenicity production and delivery of vaccine antigens for new emerging threats like the current crisis caused by zika virus fig 282
 due to the new technologies available for surveillance assay development vaccine design animal modeling and manufacturing the scientific aspects of vaccine development are not limiting our ability to prepare for emerging viral diseases the major factors that need to be addressed include 1 the political will to provide the resources necessary to conduct the epidemiology and laboratory work needed to support vaccine development 2 new business models to create an infrastructure for advanced vaccine development that does not require profit motive and 3 creative regulatory processes and clinical trial designs to evaluate products for efficacy during outbreaks that are by nature sporadic and causing social chaos importantly achieving solid efficacy data that can support licensure is critical so products can be more readily available during future epidemics
 we want to thank kayvon modjarrad emily coates and julie ledgerwood for helpful comments and discussions this work was supported by niaid intramural funding  sars bart haagmans l albert osterhaus dme   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov first emerged in the human population in november 2002 phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov isolates from animals indicated that this virus most probably originated from bats was transmitted first to palm civets and subsequently to humans at the wet markets in southern china subsequent outbreaks occurred early 2003 in hong kong hanoi toronto and singapore and could be directly traced back to one index patient who acquired the infection in guangdong and traveled to hong kong a worldwide epidemic was halted through the efforts of the world health organization which responded rapidly to this threat by issuing a global alert rigorous local containment efforts warning against unnecessary travel to affected areas and by creating a network of international experts to combat this virus in the end only 8096 people became ill and 774 people died in this first sars epidemic because sars-cov could re-emerge and cause another epidemic at any time development of effective vaccines remains of vital importance although several infectious agents including chlamydia influenza a subtype h5n1 and human metapneumovirus were considered as a possible cause of sars three groups independently reported the isolation of a previously unrecognized cov from clinical specimens of sars patients peiris et al 2003 rota et al 2003 drosten et al 2003 through electron microscopy serology and reverse-transcription pcr with consensus- and random-primers and subsequent sequencing of the replicase gene its identity could be revealed and consistently demonstrated in clinical specimens from patients with the disease but not in healthy controls to conclusively establish a causal role for this cov cynomolgous macaques were inoculated with a sars-cov isolate because the disease in macaques caused by sars-cov infection was pathologically similar to that seen in human patients with sars and since the virus was successfully re-isolated from the nasal swabs and lung lesions of these animals and a specific antibody response to the virus was shown in the infected animals sars-cov proved to be the causative agent of this infectious disease fouchier et al 2003 kuiken et al 2003 sars-cov is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus phylogentically related to coronaviruses from group 2 despite the fact that it does not encode a hemagglutinin-esterase protein snijder et al 2003 the genome is packaged together with the nucleocapsid protein at least five membrane proteins m e 3a 7a and 7b and the spike s protein fig 361
 the s1 region within the s protein and more specifically a 193-amino acid fragment of the s protein corresponding to residues 318510 has been identified as the region that interacts with the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 li et al 2005a the majority of neutralizing antibodies are directed against this region of the s protein antibodies raised against the n-terminal region of 3a protein or the m protein also inhibit sars-cov replication in vitro but their relevance in protection remains unclear the genome also encodes two large poly-proteins with diverse enzymatic activities needed for efficient replication and several accessory proteins with unknown function 3b 6 8a 8b and 9b at the end of 2004 30 countries reported a total of 8096 probable cases of sars fig 362
 pathogenic sars-covs do not circulate in the human population at the moment but their re-emergence from animal reservoirs may likely occur in the future because many of the early sars patients in guandong had epidemiological links to the live-animal market trade different animal species were tested for the presence of sars-like viruses soon after the outbreak a sars-like coronavirus which had more than 99 homology with human sars-cov was detected by rt-pcr in the nasal and fecal swabs of palm civets paguma larvata and a raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides guan et al 2003 more recent studies indicate that bats may potentially act as natural reservoirs for sars-like covs li et al 2005b lau et al 2005 however sequence comparison of the s protein genes from bat sars-like cov and palm civet sars-like cov revealed only 64 genetic homology subsequent studies by tang et al 2006 have demonstrated that approximately 6 of bats sampled in china were positive for covs interestingly these covs are genetically diverse and many bat covs clustered with existing group 1 viruses while others formed a separate lineage that included only viruses from bats putative group 5 other sars-cov like viruses clustered in a putative group 4 consisting of two subgroups one of bat covs and another of sars-covs from humans and other mammalian hosts however from these studies the direct progenitor of the sars-cov isolated from palm civets has not been identified major genetic variations in the s protein gene of these viruses from civet cats seemed essential for the transition from animal-to-human transmission to human-to-human transmission which eventually caused the sars outbreak of 20022003 there is at present no evidence for the virus persisting in the human population possible options for the re-emergence of sars include the escape of the virus from laboratories which has already occurred on three occasions the re-emergence of the virus from its animal reservoir remains possible given that the virus is detectable in the feces and respiratory secretions of some animals indeed sars-cov re-emerged in four patients in guangdong in december 2003 although these sars-like covs caused milder clinical disease liang et al 2004 the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases biodefense network classified sars-cov as a category c priority pathogen pointing out that sars-cov could be a potential biothreat agent the clinical symptoms of sars-cov infection are those of lower respiratory tract disease and include fever malaise peripheral t cell lymphocytopenia decreased platelet counts prolonged coagulation profiles and mildly elevated serum hepatic enzymes peiris et al 2004 li et al 2004 chest radiography reveals infiltrates with subpleural consolidation or ground glass changes compatible with viral pneumonitis around 2030 of individuals with sars require management in intensive care units and the overall casefatality rate reached approximately 10 although the main clinical symptoms are those of severe respiratory illness sars-cov actually also causes a gastrointestinal and urinary tract infection sars-cov can be detected in the feces and urine of patients and electron microscopic studies of biopsies of the upper and lower intestinal mucosae of patients with sars confirmed the presence of the virus in these tissues peiris et al 2004 fecal transmission proved to be important in at least one major community outbreak in hong kong amoy gardens in which over 300 patients were infected within a few days three features of sars may be relevant for intervention strategies first progressive age dependence in mortality and disease severity is observed in sars patients in fact none of the sars-cov-infected children aged below 12 years in hong kong required intensive care or mechanical ventilation ng et al 2004 this is not totally explained by comorbid factors but similar age dependence in mortality is seen in patients with other nonviral causes of acute respiratory stress syndrome rubenfeld et al 2005 second virus transmission is low in the first days of illness and peaks around day 10 after disease onset chu et al 2004 finally several studies revealed that high viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate was found to be an independent predictor of mortality hung et al 2004 chu et al 2004 therefore vaccine strategies aimed at reducing the viral load may suffice to provide clinical benefit the first efforts to treat sars patients were mainly based on the use of ribavirin and corticosteroids ribavirin which targets imp dehydrogenase has been known a long time as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent however current data do not support the use of ribavirin for sars treatment in vitro studies did not show significant antiviral activity cinatl et al 2003 and ribavirin enhanced the infectivity of sars-cov in mice barnard et al 2006 on the other hand a protective effect of interferon ifn- has been observed in a preliminary study during the sars outbreak loutfy et al 2003 these results are in concordance with several studies that noted antiviral activity in vitro cinatl et al 2003 hensley et al 2004 and animal studies showing that pegylated ifn- effectively reduced sars-cov replication and excretion viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes and the pulmonary damage in cynomolgous macaques that were infected experimentally with sars-cov haagmans et al 2004 however despite an extensive literature reporting on sars treatments it is not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the sars outbreak because of variation in treatment regimensparticularly the wide range in doses duration of therapy and route of administration of ribavirin and corticosteroids no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding the efficacy of the drugs tested stockman et al 2006 in the event of a future outbreak of sars-cov or another novel agent attempts should be made to develop treatment protocols organize randomized trials and to collect and contribute information for a standardized minimum dataset that could facilitate analysis of treatment outcomes among different settings stockman et al 2006
 the major sources of transmission in humans are droplets that deposit on the respiratory epithelium unlike the situation in several other respiratory viral infections viral load of sars-cov in the upper respiratory tract peaked around day 10 after disease onset peiris et al 2004 therefore virus transmission may be less efficient in the first days of illness a finding supported by epidemiological observations real-time pcr assays detect sars-cov during the first week in specimens of the lower respiratory tract eg bronchoalveolar lavage sputum endotracheal aspirates nasopharyngeal aspirate throat swabs andor serum chan et al 2004 che et al 2004 whereas fecal samples may show very high viral loads toward the end of the first week and second week of illness in typical cases which were largely confined to adult and elderly individuals sars presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage and multiorgan dysfunction upon autopsy nicholls et al 2003 the pathological changes in lung alveoli most likely follow a common pathway characterized by an acute phase of protein-rich alveolar fluid influx into the alveolar lumina as a consequence of the injury to the alveolar wall subsequently type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia takes place to replace the loss of infected type-1 pneumocytes and to cover the denuded epithelial basement membrane resulting in restoration of the normal alveolar architecture severe alveolar injury may lead to fibrosis with loss of alveolar function in more protracted cases fig 363
 it has been hypothesized that the pathological changes observed in the lungs are initiated by a disproportional innate immune response illustrated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as cxcl10 ip-10 ccl2 mcp-1 il-6 il-8 il-12 il-1 and ifn- huang et al 2005 wong et al 2004 these in vivo data have been confirmed in vitro demonstrating that sars-cov infection induces a range of cytokines and chemokines in diverse cell types cheung et al 2005 law et al 2005 although in vitro studies argued that production of type i ifns is inhibited or delayed by sars-cov in sars-cov-infected macaques and also early during sars in humans type i ifns can be readily demonstrated de lang et al 2007 because prophylactic treatment of macaques with pegylated ifn- reduces sars-cov replication in the lungs regulation of the production of ifns may be important in controlling sars haagmans et al 2004
 seroconversion usually occurs in weeks 2 or 3 of illness and virus-neutralizing antibodies can be detected in convalescent human serum in patients who had recovered from sars-neutralizing antibody titers peaked at month 4 but were undetectable in 16 of patients at month 36 cao et al 2007 neutralizing antibodies may be directed against different regions of the s protein s1 and s2 as monoclonal antibodies against these epitopes exert potent neutralization of sars-cov in vitro sui et al 2004 lip et al 2006 liu et al 2007 conversely peptides which are located in these regions were able to induce neutralizing antibodies bisht et al 2005 keng et al 2005 zhang et al 2004 although experiments in diverse animal models have revealed that relatively low levels of neutralizing antibodies exert potent protection against lower respiratory tract infection the neutralizing antibody titer necessary to achieve protection in humans exposed to sars-cov is not known a concern in case of re-emergence of sars is the possible absence of cross protection against these viruses however recent studies by he et al 2006 have shown that the some neutralizing epitopes of sars-cov have been maintained during cross-species transmission suggesting that receptor binding domain-based vaccines may induce broad protection against both human and animal sars-cov variants in most sars autopsies extensive necrosis of the spleen and atrophy of the white pulp with severe lymphocyte depletion have been observed on the other hand rapid phase in peripheral lymphocyte recovery usually coincided with improved clinical conditions of sars patients peiris et al 2004 long-lived memory t cell responses against sars-cov nucleocapsid and s protein have been demonstrated in recovered sars patients although their relevance in antiviral protection is not well understood yang et al 2006 peng et al 2006 li et al 2006 however despite potent immune responses and clinical recovery peripheral lymphocyte counts in the recovered patients were not restored to normal levels li et al 2006 interestingly mice that lack nk-t cells or nk cells or t and b cells all cleared the virus by day 9 after infection glass et al 2004 these data argue that cell-mediated immune responses are not essential to control virus clearance inactivated sars vaccines have been reported to elicit high titers of s protein-specific neutralizing antibodies few studies however have addressed whether inactivated whole sars-cov virions confer protection from virus challenge mice that were immunized twice with a candidate sars-cov vaccine produced through a two-step inactivation procedure involving sequential formaldehyde and uv inactivation developed high-antibody titers against the sars-cov s protein and high levels of neutralizing antibodies spruth et al 2006 see chapter 11 moreover the vaccine conferred protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention of sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract of mice after intranasal challenge with sars-cov protection of mice was correlated to the antibody titer against the sars-cov s protein and neutralizing antibody titer similar results have been obtained using a beta-propiolactone inactivated sars-cov vaccine in mice stadler et al 2005 in addition two chinese groups have demonstrated protective efficacy of inactivated sars vaccines in rhesus monkeys qin et al 2006 zhou et al 2005 zou et al 2004 a soluble recombinant polypeptide containing the n-terminal segment of the s glycoprotein may suffice to induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity in mice bisht et al 2005 in addition a trimeric recombinant s protein was able to elicit an efficacious protective immune response in hamsters kam et al 2007 one of the most promising vaccine candidates is based on the combination of recombinant s protein with the protollin adjuvant in both young and aged mice an intranasal protollin-formulated s protein vaccine elicited high levels of antigen-specific igg in serum and significant levels of antigen-specific lung iga hu et al 2007 in contrast mice immunized intramuscularly with alum absorbed s protein did not develop detectable iga responses following virus challenge of the aged mice no virus was detected in the lungs of mice vaccinated intranasally whereas intramuscularly immunized mice did not show significant control of virus replication compared to controls hu et al 2007 a dna vaccine encoding the s glycoprotein of the sars-cov induces t cell neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity in a mouse model yang et al 2004 these authors also demonstrated that antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of s protein that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these s protein plasmid dna expression vectors and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a t-cell-dependent immune mechanism subsequent studies using a prime-boost combination of dna and whole killed sars-cov vaccines elicited higher antibody responses than dna or whole killed virus vaccines alone kong et al 2005 apart from this study several other groups have analyzed the immunogenicity of sars dna vaccines but none of these challenged the vaccinated animals with sars-cov adenovirus-vector based vaccination strategies against sars-cov were employed early on after the sars outbreak to demonstrate that vaccinated rhesus macaques developed virus-neutralizing antibody responses against fragment s1 of the s protein and t cell responses against the nucleocapsid gao et al 2003 more recently see et al 2006 demonstrated that vaccination of c57bl6 mice with adenovirus type 5-expressing s and nucleocapsid administered intranasally but not intramuscularly significantly limited sars-cov replication in the lungs
 the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara mva has been used to express the s glycoprotein of sars-cov in vaccination experiments using mouse ferret and rhesus monkey models bisht et al 2004 chen et al 2005 weingartl et al 2004 intranasal and intramuscular administration of mva encoding the sars-cov s protein led to the induction of a humoral immune response in balbc mice as well as reduced viral titers in the respiratory tract bisht et al 2005 recombinant bovine-human parainfluenza virus type 3 vector bhpiv3 is being developed as a live attenuated intranasal pediatric vaccine against human parainfluenza virus type 3 immunization of african green monkeys with a single dose of bhpiv3 expressing sars-cov s protein administered via the respiratory tract induced the production of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies bukreyev et al 2004 a recombinant bhpiv3 expressing sars-cov structural protein s m and n individually or in combination has been evaluated for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in hamsters buchholz et al 2004 in the absence of s protein expression of m n or e did not induce a detectable serum sars-cov-neutralizing antibody response and no protection against sars-cov challenge in the respiratory tract whereas the vectors expressing the s protein induced neutralizing antibody responses and protection recombinant rabies virus expressing the s protein of sars-cov induced a neutralizing antibody response in mice faber et al 2005 similarly an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus vector that encodes the sars-cov s protein may be used to induce neutralizing antibody responses kapadia et al 2005 mice vaccinated with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing s protein developed sars-cov-neutralizing antibody and were able to control a challenge with sars-cov performed at either 1 month or 4 months after a single vaccination in addition by passive antibody transfer experiments these authors demonstrated that the antibody response induced by the vaccine was sufficient to control sars-cov infection the efficacy of these vectors was further demonstrated in studies using aged mice in aged mice vaccinated with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing s protein antibody titers induced were sufficient to protect them against subsequent challenge with sars-cov vogel et al 2007 african green monkeys immunized via the respiratory tract with two doses of a recombinant newcastle disease virus encoding the s protein developed a relatively high titer of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies and upon challenge demonstrated a 1000-fold reduction in pulmonary sars-cov titer compared with control animals dinapoli et al 2007 finally venezuelan equine encephalitis virus based vaccines have been tested extensively in young and aged mice most importantly different recombinant sars-cov bearing epidemic and zoonotic s protein variants were used to challenge the vaccinated mice venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles expressing the 2003 epidemic urbani sars-cov strain s glycoprotein but not particles containing the nucleocapsid protein from the same strain provided complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice deming et al 2006 although the s protein encoding vaccine provided complete short-term protection against heterologous strain gd03 challenge in young mice only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals interestingly nucleocapsid-encoding vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge but also resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of sars-cov-challenged mice deming et al 2006 a new generation of vaccines may be obtained from manipulating the full-length infectious cdna clone of sars-cov one approach would be to delete the orfs 3a 3b 6 7a 7b 8a 8b or 9b similar to other coronavirus mutants generated previously some mouse hepatitis or feline infectious peritonitis deletion viruses replicate to the same extent as wild-type viruses in vitro but are severely attenuated in vivo making them potential vaccine candidates however sars-cov deletion mutants lacking orfs 3a 3b 6 7a or 7b grew similar to that of the parental wild-type virus in the mouse model yount et al 2005 on the other hand a recombinant sars-cov that lacks the e gene was attenuated both in vitro and in vivo dediego et al 2007 viable recombinant virus with the e gene deleted was recovered in vero cells with a titer around 106
 pfuml but titers in the respiratory tract of hamsters were 1001000-fold reduced compared to wild-type sars-cov replication suggesting that this mutant is attenuated multiplication of these viruses in packaging cell lines would provide the missing protein in trans and would make a promising sars-cov vaccine candidate that has the e gene deleted live attenuated virus vaccines may revert to wild-type and recombine with other circulating human or zoonotic coronaviruses in order to prevent this it has been proposed to delete an essential gene located in a position distant from gene e and the relocation of the deleted gene to the position previously occupied by gene e enjuanes et al 2008 a potential recombination leading to the rescue of gene e would lead to the loss of the essential gene alternatively the transcriptional regulatory sequences trs of a vaccine virus could be genetically manipulated to a sequence incompatible with the trs of any known circulating coronavirus as described by yount et al 2006 this virus could be further modified by building attenuating mutations on the genetic backbone of the recombination resistant trs rewired virus either for use as a safe high titer seed stock for making killed vaccines or as a live virus vaccine one such attenuating mutation could be targeted to the nonstructural protein 1 recombinant mouse hepatitis virus mhv encoding a deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence grew normally in tissue culture but was severely attenuated in vivo zst et al 2007 low doses of nsp1 mutant mhv elicited potent cytotoxic t cell responses and protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenge this attenuation strategy provides a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient coronavirus vaccines although several types of vectored vaccines have been developed several companies favored the classical approach using inactivated whole virus to develop a vaccine to be used for preclinical testing see chapter 11 methods in place for the production of available vaccines could be easily used using well-established technologies in the preclinical development stage it is preferable that different animal species are used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines overall a wide range of animal species including rodents mice and hamsters carnivores ferrets and cats and nonhuman primates cynomolgus and rhesus macaques common marmosets and african green monkeys can be experimentally infected with sars-cov subbarao et al 2004 roberts et al 2005b martina et al 2003 kuiken et al 2003 mcauliffe et al 2004 haagmans and osterhaus 2006 most species show no clinical signs of disease although the virus replicates efficiently in respiratory tissues aged mice and ferrets on the other hand show signs of clinical disease albeit in the absence of the typical lung lesions seen in humans with sars roberts et al 2005a in contrast inoculation of sars-cov in the respiratory tract of cynomolgus macaques causes infection of bronchial epithelial cells and type-1 pneumocytes 14 days postinfection followed by extensive type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia in the lungs at 46 days postinfection kuiken et al 2003 haagmans and osterhaus 2006 the lesions consisting of multiple foci of acute diffuse alveolar damage and characterized by flooding of alveoli with protein-rich edema fluid mixed with variable numbers of neutrophils are quite similar to those observed in humans in the acute stages of sars remarkably vaccine candidates tested in ferrets showed reduced efficacy vaccination with mva encoding the s protein induced only moderate antibody responses and consequently did not protect against intranasal sars-cov infection and even resulted in an inflammatory response in the livers of the vaccinated ferrets weingartl et al 2004 whether these aberrant responses resulted from immunopathological mechanisms like antibody-dependent enhancement of infection or represented recall responses to viral antigen in the liver is not clear at the moment but deserves further investigation in addition limited protection from sars-cov challenge was observed in ferrets vaccinated with inactivated whole virus darnell et al 2007 two out of four ferrets showed little or no neutralizing antibody even after the second immunization and none of the vaccinated ferrets were able to reduce virus excretion at day 2 after challenge but subsequently cleared the virus more rapidly compared to control animals adenovirus-based vaccines tested in ferrets seemed more powerful as they protected the lower respiratory tract efficiently but had less effect on virus excretion in the upper respiratory tract kobinger et al 2007 five years after the first sars outbreak a range of candidate vaccines have been developed early in 2006 some companies in china and the us initiated phase 1 trials the first clinical trial has been initiated by a chinese company sinovac biotech of beijing in collaboration with the chinese academy of medical sciences using an inactivated whole virus vaccine to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine 36 subjects received two doses of vaccine or placebo control on day 42 all individuals showed seroconversion and peak titers of neutralizing antibodies were reached 2 weeks after the second vaccination followed by a significant decline 4 weeks later lin et al 2007 several other candidate sars vaccines are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development in sars patients who recover high levels of neutralizing antibody responses are observed suggesting that antibody responses play a role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of sars-cov-infected patients zhang et al 2006 although attempts have been made to test the efficacy of serum preparations from seroconvalescent sars patients in the acute phase of sars no conclusive evidence has been obtained regarding their efficacy in mice on the other hand sars-cov infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of convalescent immunoglobulines subbarao et al 2004 the concept that antibodies protect against sars has been further explored through the generation of human monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov prophylactic administration of a human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of sars-cov in the lungs of infected ferrets by 1000-fold completely prevented the development of sars-cov-induced macroscopic lung pathology and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions ter meulen et al 2004 in subsequent studies several other monoclonal antibodies were evaluated for their efficacy in mouse and hamster models sui et al 2005 traggiai et al 2004 the importance of assessing immunogenicity of candidate sars-cov vaccines using virus neutralization assays is well acknowledged but the variety of these tests in use is a significant problem since there is at this time no consensus on the most sensitive specific and reproducible assay system to compare data from each of the candidate vaccines requires international standardization of the immunological assays and the availability of an antibody standard used for the evaluation of these vaccines to test cross reactivity of antibodies generated by vaccination murine leukemia virus was used to generate infectious particles containing different s proteins giroglou et al 2004 enhanced disease and mortality have been observed in kittens immunized against or infected with a type i coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv when subsequently exposed to fipv infection weiss and scott 1981 macrophages are able to take up feline coronavirus-antibody complexes more efficiently causing the virus to replicate to higher titers interestingly one study also demonstrated that antibodies against human sars-cov isolates enhance entry of pseudo-typed viruses expressing the civet cat sars-like cov s protein into cells but not replication yang et al 2005 to date there is no evidence for enhanced replication following sars-cov challenge in previously immunized animals one other problem which may arise after vaccination with whole inactivated virus when absorbed with certain adjuvants such as alum could relate to the induction of skewed th2 recall responses similar to what has been observed in children vaccinated with inactivated respiratory syncytial and measles virus vaccines although much effort has been focused on developing a sars vaccine the commercial viability of developing a vaccine for sars-cov will ultimately depend on whether the virus re-emerges in the near future it is questionable whether possible future outbreaks will cause major outbreaks but vaccines antivirals or passive immunization would be relevant in the context of protecting high-risk individuals such as laboratory and health-care workers 
five years after the first sars outbreak several candidate sars-cov vaccines are at various stages of preclinical and clinical developmentbased on the observation that sars-cov infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of antibodies directed against the s protein of sars-cov vaccines encoding this protein have been developedanimals immunized with diverse vaccines containing the s protein or s protein gene developed sars-cov-neutralizing antibodies and were protected against sars-cov challengefuture challenges for the development of sars-cov vaccines are linked to the potential re-emergence of this virus vaccines able to induce highly cross-reactive antibodies which efficiently protect the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract are needed given the fact that in the previous outbreak mainly elderly humans succumbed to the infection special attention should be given to protect specifically these individuals
  sars-cov-2 vaccines status report fatima amanat florian krammer   sars-cov-2 is part of the coronaviridae family whose members are named after their crown-like appearance under the electron microscope caused by the surface glycoproteins that decorate the virus the family includes two subfamilies letovirinae and orthocoronavirinae orthocoronavirinae includes the genera alphacoronvirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses typically infect only mammals whereas gammacoronoviruses and deltacoronaviruses typically infect avian species and sometimes mammals cui et al 2019 coronaviruses are common human pathogens two types of alphacoronaviruses 229e and nl63 and two types of betacoronaviruses oc43 and hku1 circulate in humans and cause common cold more pathogenic coronaviruses for humans include sars-cov-1 the middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and now sars-cov-2 which are all betacoronaviruses coronaviruses have a large 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense rna genome encoding for several open reading frames one frame encodes the spike protein s protein a class i fusion protein that mediates attachment of the virus to cell surface receptors followed by uptake into endosomes for most coronaviruses proteolytic cleavage of the s protein and fusion of viral and endosomal membranes trigger release of viral rna into the cytosol reviewed in fehr and perlman 2015 the rna contains a 5 cap structure and a 3 polya tail that allows expression of the replicase which is encoded by approximately two-thirds of the genome the other third codes for the structural and accessory proteins the replicase is expressed as two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab these include up to 16 nonstructural proteins nsps the nsps are generated by processing of pp1a and pp1ab by 23 viral proteases encoded within the replicase many nsps then assemble into the replicase-transcriptase complex thatin the host cell cytosolproduces anti-sense genome new viral genome and subgenomic rna that serves as mrna structural proteins s matrix m protein and envelope e are then generated and inserted into the endoplasmatic reticulum and follow the secretory pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic a minority of coronaviruses also encode a hemagglutinin esterase he in many coronaviruses the s protein is cleaved into two subunits s1 and s2 often by furin-like proteases the rna genome associates with nucleoprotein and then buds into the ergic forming virus particles after assembly virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and are exocytosed several accessory proteins which seem to be important for pathogenesis are also expressed but not all are functionally characterized clinical trials with the nucleotide analog remdesivir clinicaltrialsgov nct04257656 nct04252664 nct04280705 etc and protease inhibitors clinicaltrialsgov nct04255017 nct04276688 etc as well as other treatment options are ongoing in china and the united states and trial results are expected within weeks remdesivir works against coronaviruses closely related to sars-cov-2 in animal models as well as against the related mers-cov including in nhps agostini et al 2018 brown et al 2019 de wit et al 2020 sheahan et al 2017 sheahan et al 2020 remdesivir was also tested for treatment of ebolavirus infections in humans and found to be less successful than other treatments by mulangu et al 2019 therefore safety data exist for this therapeutic agent which should accelerate the process of clinical testing against sars-cov-2 remdesivirs mechanism of action as a nucleotide analog is not clear but it likely terminates rna synthesis leads to incorporation mutagenesis or both agostini et al 2018 in addition a combination of the two licensed hiv inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir is also being tested in clinical trials eg clinicaltrialsgov nct04264858 etc lopinavir is a bona fide protease inhibitor whereas ritonavir was initially designed as protease inhibitor but was found to boost the half-life of lopinavir by inhibiting cytochrome p450 hull and montaner 2011 the combination was compassionately used as treatment for sars-cov-1 in 20032004 and showed some promise chu et al 2004 effectiveness of the combination was limited in mice but appreciable in nhp models of mers-cov chan et al 2015 sheahan et al 2020 the mechanism of action of lopinavir is not clear but it likely inhibits one or more coronavirus proteases other treatment options with ongoing or planned clinical trials include dosing recombinant human ace2 to neutralize the virus and prevent lung damage clinicaltrialsgov nct04287686 and using the antiviral arbidol a fusion inhibitor kadam and wilson 2017 teissier et al 2011 another interesting option is the use of convalescent serum as treatment clinical trials to test this are ongoing in china clinicaltrialsgov nct04264858 placebo control not recruiting yet and compassionate use of this strategy has recently started in the us eg at mount sinai medical center ny similarly polyclonal human immunoglobulin g igg derived from transgenic cows could be used because this strategy has been successful for mers-cov in animal models luke et al 2016 and has been tested for safety in clinical trials clinicaltrialsgov nct02788188 many of these trials will have results within months and if remdesivir produced by gilead andor lopinavir plus ritonavir produced by abbvie as kaletra and aluvia respectively show effectiveness they could potentially be used widely within a short time frame compassionate use of these drugs has already been reported for sars-cov-2 infections holshue et al 2020 lim et al 2020 during the 2009 h1n1 influenza virus pandemic vaccine producers switched their production pipelines quickly from producing trivalent seasonal influenza virus vaccines to monovalent pandemic vaccines this was basically just a change of strains and established and approved processes established release criteria and existing correlates of protection could be used krammer and palese 2015 still it took six months until the vaccine was ready to be distributed and used and it came too late to affect the second pandemic wave which took place in the united states in fall 2009 this time we are facing a new challenge in the form of a virus that has just emerged in humans and the response will be more complex because there are no existing vaccines or production processes for coronavirus vaccines vaccine technology has significantly evolved in the last decade including the development of several rna and dna vaccine candidates licensed vectored vaccines eg ervebo a vesicular stomatitis virus vsv-vectored ebolavirus vaccine licensed in the european union recombinant protein vaccines eg flublok an influenza virus vaccine made in insect cells licensed in the united states and cell-culture-based vaccines eg flucelvax an influenza virus vaccine made in mammalian cells sars-cov-2 was identified in record time and its genomic sequence was swiftly made widely available by chinese researchers wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 in addition we know from studies on sars-cov-1 and the related mers-cov vaccines that the s protein on the surface of the virus is an ideal target for a vaccine in sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 this protein interacts with the receptor ace2 and antibodies targeting the spike can interfere with this binding thereby neutralizing the virus figure 1
 the structure of the s protein of sars-cov-2 was solved in record time at high resolution contributing to our understanding of this vaccine target lan et al 2020a wrapp et al 2020 therefore we have a target antigen that can be incorporated into advanced vaccine platforms several vaccines for sars-cov-1 were developed and tested in animal models including recombinant s-protein-based vaccines attenuated and whole inactivated vaccines and vectored vaccines roper and rehm 2009 most of these vaccines protect animals from challenge with sars-cov-1 although many do not induce sterilizing immunity in some cases vaccination with the live virus results in complications including lung damage and infiltration of eosinophils in a mouse model eg bolles et al 2011 tseng et al 2012 and liver damage in ferrets eg weingartl et al 2004 in another study vaccination with inactivated sars-cov-1 led to enhancement of disease in one nhp whereas it protected 3 animals from challenge wang et al 2016 the same study identified certain epitopes on the s protein as protective whereas immunity to others seemed to be enhancing disease however in almost all cases vaccination is associated with greater survival reduced virus titers andor less morbidity compared with that in unvaccinated animals similar findings have been reported for mers-cov vaccines agrawal et al 2016 houser et al 2017 therefore whereas vaccines for related coronaviruses are efficacious in animal models we need to ensure that the vaccines which are developed for sars-cov-2 are sufficiently safe another consideration for effective coronavirus vaccine development might be waning of the antibody response infection with human coronaviruses does not always induce long-lived antibody responses and re-infection of an individual with the same virus is possible after an extended period of time but only in a fraction of individuals and resulting in mild or no symtpoms as shown in human challenge studies callow et al 1990 antibody titers in individuals that survived sars-cov-1 or mers-cov infections often waned after 23 years liu et al 2006 wu et al 2007 or were weak initially choe et al 2017 despite that re-infections are unlikely in the short term of note re-infections after days of recovery have been reported recently but appear to be the consequences of false negative test results lan et al 2020b however they could happen when humoral immunity wanes over months and years an effective sars-cov-2 vaccine will need to overcome these issues to protect in a scenario in which the virus becomes endemic and causes recurrent seasonal epidemics sars-cov-2 infection causes the most severe pathology in individuals above 50 years of age the reason for this is not clear but many viral infections have milder manifestations in naive younger individuals than in naive older individuals because older individuals are more affected it will be important to develop vaccines that protect this segment of the population unfortunately older individuals typically respond less well to vaccination because of immune senescence sambhara and mcelhaney 2009 for influenza which is problematic for older adults specific formulations for this segment of the population include more antigen or an adjuvant diazgranados et al 2013 tsai 2013 protection in older individuals appears to require higher neutralization titers against influenza virus than in younger individuals benoit et al 2015 and this issue might need to be addressed for sars-cov-2 if vaccination in older individuals is not effective they could still benefit indirectly if vaccination is able to stop transmission of the virus in younger individuals only a small number of sars-cov-1 vaccines made it to phase i clinical trials before funding dried up because of eradication of the virus from the human population through non-pharmaceutical interventions when case numbers were still small results from these trials performed with an inactivated virus vaccine and a spike-based dna vaccine are encouraging because the vaccines were safe and induced neutralizing antibody titers lin et al 2007 martin et al 2008 some neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated against sars-cov-1 like cr3022 ter meulen et al 2006 tian et al 2020 can cross-react to the receptor binding domain of sars-cov-2 this suggests that sars-cov-1 vaccines might cross-protect against sars-cov-2 however because these vaccines have not been developed further than phase i they are currently not available for use vaccines against mers-cov also targeting the mers-cov s protein are in pre-clinical and clinical development including vaccines based on modified vaccinia ankara vectors adenovirus vectors and dna-based vaccines and several of them are supported by the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovation cepi yong et al 2019 however it is unlikely that mers-cov vaccines induce strong cross-neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov-2 because of the phylogenetic distance between the two viruses nevertheless we can still learn a lot from these vaccines about how to move forward with sars-cov-2 vaccine design pallesen et al 2017 the development of vaccines for human use can take years especially when novel technologies are used that have not been extensively tested for safety or scaled up for mass production because no coronavirus vaccines are on the market and no large-scale manufacturing capacity for these vaccines exists as yet table 1
 we will need to build these processes and capacities doing this for the first time can be tedious and time consuming figure 1 cepi has awarded funds to several highly innovative players in the field and many of them will likely succeed in eventually making a sars-cov-2 vaccine however none of these companies and institutions have an established pipeline to bring such a vaccine to late-stage clinical trials that allow licensure by regulatory agencies and they do not currently have the capacity to produce the number of doses needed an mrna-based vaccine which expresses target antigen in vivo in the vaccinee after injection of mrna encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles co-developed by moderna and the vaccine research center at the national institutes of health is currently the furthest along and a phase i clinical trial recently started clinicaltrialsgov nct04283461 curevac is working on a similar vaccine but is still in the pre-clinical phase additional approaches in the pre-clinical stage include recombinant-protein-based vaccines focused on the s protein eg express2ion ibio novavax baylor college of medicine university of queensland and sichuan clover biopharmaceuticals viral-vector-based vaccines focused on the s protein eg vaxart geovax university of oxford and cansino biologics dna vaccines focused on the s protein eg inovio and applied dna sciences live attenuated vaccines codagenix with the serum institute of india etc and inactivated virus vaccines figure 1 table 1 all of these platforms have advantages and disadvantages table 1 and it is not possible to predict which strategy will be faster or more successful johnson  johnson jj johnson  johnson 2020 and sanofi 2020 recently joined efforts to develop sars-cov-2 vaccines however jj is using an experimental adenovirus vector platform that has not yet resulted in a licensed vaccine sanofis vaccine to be made using a process similar to the process used for their approved flublok recombinant influenza virus vaccine zhou et al 2006 is also months if not years from being ready for use in the human population why does this take so long as mentioned earlier there are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines in addition many technologies used production platforms vectors etc are new and need to be tested thoroughly for safety the target for the vaccine the s protein has been identified and vaccine candidates are being generated this is usually followed by two important steps that are typically needed before bringing a vaccine into clinical trials first the vaccine is tested in appropriate animal models to see whether it is protective however animal models for sars-cov-2 might be difficult to develop the virus does not grow in wild-type mice and only induced mild disease in transgenic animals expressing human ace2 bao et al 2020 other potential animal models include ferrets and nhps for which pathogenicity studies are ongoing even in the absence of an animal model that replicates human disease it is possible to evaluate the vaccine because serum from vaccinated animals can be tested in in vitro neutralization assays post-challenge safety data should also be collected in these cases to assess for complications such as the ones seen sars-cov-1 and mers-cov vaccines second vaccines need to be tested for toxicity in animals eg in rabbits usually viral challenge is not part of this process because only the safety of the vaccine will be evaluated this testing which has to be performed in a manner compliant with glp good laboratory practice typically takes 36 months to complete for some vaccine platforms parts of the safety testing might be skipped if there is already sufficient data available for similar vaccines made in the same production process vaccines for human use are produced in processes that comply with current good manufacturing practice cgmp to ensure constant quality and safety of vaccines this requires dedicated facilities trained personnel proper documentation and raw material that was produced to be of cgmp quality these processes have to be designed or amended to fit sars-cov-2 vaccines for many vaccine candidates in the preclinical phase such processes do not yet exist and have to be developed from scratch once sufficient pre-clinical data are available and initial batches of the vaccine have been produced that are of cgmp quality clinical trials might be initiated typically clinical development of vaccines starts with small phase i trials to evaluate the safety of vaccine candidates in humans these are followed by phase ii trials formulation and doses are established to initially prove efficacy and finally by phase iii trials in which the efficacy and safety of a vaccine need to be demonstrated in a larger cohort however in an extraordinary situation like the current one this scheme might be compressed and an accelerated regulatory approval pathway might be developed if efficacy is shown a vaccine might be licensed by regulatory agencies another important point is that production capacity to produce sufficient amounts of cgmp-quality vaccine needs to be available for vaccines based on existing vaccine platforms eg inactivated or live attenuated vaccines this can be relatively easily achieved because existing infrastructure can be used table 1 for vaccines based on novel technologies eg mrna this capacity needs to be built and this typically takes time although it would be beneficial if even a limited number of doses were available to protect health care workers and the most vulnerable segments of the population the goal should be to make vaccines available to the global population this will be challenging even for influenza virus vaccines for which many production facilities exist in high-income countries as well as low- and middle-income countries the demand in the case of a pandemic would by far exceed the production capacity finally it takes time to distribute vaccines and administer them to vaccinate a large proportion of the population would likely take weeks given that the population is currently naive to sars-cov-2 it is highly likely that more than one dose of the vaccine will be needed prime-boost vaccination regimens are typically used in such cases and the two vaccinations are usually spaced 34 weeks apart it is likely that protective immunity will be achieved only 12 weeks after the second vaccination this therefore adds another 12 months to the timeline even if shortcuts for several of the steps mentioned earlier can be found it is unlikely that a vaccine would be available earlier than 6 months after the initiation of clinical trials realistically sars-cov-2 vaccines will not be available for another 1218 months what are potential solutions for these long time frames in the future one possibility is to build production capacity to be globally distributed if possible that can be activated in the event of new emerging viruses from todays perspective only a few types of viruses are likely to cause respiratory disease that leads to rapid global spread surveillance in the animal reservoir paired with virus characterization studies can identify members of virus families that have the potential to cause pandemics vaccine candidates using these isolates could then be produced tested in animals to determine the mechanisms of protection and tested in humans to establish the safety of the vaccines it is unlikely that the same viruses that are chosen as vaccine candidates will later cause outbreaks however if the vaccine candidate is sufficiently closely related sequences for the vaccines could be quickly switched and the vaccines for the newly emerging viruses could be swiftly produced and moved to late-stage clinical trials right away while large-scale production is ramped up globally in addition stockpiled vaccines based on the initial candidates could be deployed even if slightly mismatched to the strain causing the outbreak a strategy that is currently used for h5 and h7 avian influenza virus vaccines this would allow a response within a few weeks and could potentially stop a virus locally before it becomes pandemic an alternative but challenging solution would be the development of broadly protective vaccines that cover whole virus families or genera this effort is ongoing for influenza viruses erbelding et al 2018 and could potentially be applied to coronaviruses or at least betacoronaviruses both of these options are costly and require global political will and vision considering the deep dive stock markets have taken in recent weeks and given the expected effect of a pandemic on the economy funding for vaccine production infrastructure that would allow a swift response to emerging viruses looks like a great investment however without a pandemic looming such investments have rarely been made in the past except for h5 and h7 subtype influenza viruses now would be the right time to consider investing in vaccines against emerging viruses that can lead to loss of human lives and burden the global economy an investment of a few billion dollars would allow us to have sufficient surveillance appropriate vaccine candidates and infrastructure ready that could churn out vaccines for use in the global population quickly and effectively potentially stopping an emerging virus in its tracks in addition we need well-developed emergency plans that allow us to develop test produce and distribute vaccines within weeks not months or years this would need tight coordination among pharmaceutical companies governments regulatory agencies and the world health organization who as well as novel and out-of-the-box approaches to cgmp production release processes regulatory science and clinical trial design for sars-cov-2 vaccines might come too late to affect the first wave of this pandemic however they might be useful if additional waves occur later or in a post-pandemic scenario in which sars-cov-2 continues to circulate as a seasonal virus in addition lessons learned from handling this outbreak will allow us to be better prepared in the future the viruses will keep coming  highly pathogenic coronaviruses thrusting vaccine development in the spotlight chunting he ming qin xun sun   in 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus was found in humans1 on february 11 2020 who announced a new name for the epidemic disease corona virus disease covid-19 meanwhile the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named the novel coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 as of may 16th 2020 the epidemic of covid-19 has caused more than 4400000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 300000 reported deaths2 covid-19 is the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease3 after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers sars is a zoonosis caused by sars-cov which has infected 8096 humans including 774 deaths mortality rate 96 in at least 29 countries4 another highly pathogenic coronavirus mers-cov has been reported in 27 countries with reported viral infection and 858 associated deaths mortality rate 3445 research indicates that sars-cov was transmitted from civet cats to humans and mers-cov was transmitted from dromedary camels to humans however the intermediate host of sars-cov-2 has not been identified6 7 8 sars-cov-2 together with sars-cov and mers-cov has posed significant threats to international health due to theirs high pathogenicity and infectivity vaccination is an important strategy to provide protection from infectious diseases however to date no vaccine has been approved to prevent coronavirus infection indicating the need for further development of novel and effective vaccines against coronavirus infection in this review we will illustrate vaccine design targets review current advances and potential strategies for vaccine development based on the spike s protein of sars-cov and mers-cov and focus on how to improve the efficacy of vaccines through adjuvant formulations overall these strategies may provide useful guidance for vaccine development of sars-cov-2 coronaviruses are widespread in nature it can cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans according to the phylogenetic relationships coronavirus can be divided into four genera alpha beta gamma and delta alpha and beta genera can infect mammals while gamma and delta genera are mostly avian coronaviruses9 there are seven known coronavirus that can infect humans 229e oc43 nl63 hku1 sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 the first four viruses cause only mild minor respiratory illness the other three strainssars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2are zoonotic and lead to severe respiratory syndrome10 11 12 coronaviruses are the largest single positive-strand rna viruses with a genome of 2732 kb13 it is named for its corona-like appearance fig 1
a the virus genome mainly encodes four structural proteins spike s nucleocapsid n membrane m envelope e proteins s protein forms the spikes on the surface of coronaviruses and mediates adsorption and fusion of the virus and host cells n protein forms a helical capsid which locates inside the viral membrane to protect viral rna m and e proteins are important components of the viral envelope and together mediate the assembly process of the virus14 among the four structural proteins s protein is the leading mediator of virus entry and is the main factor that determines the virulence and host range of the virus sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 have strong human-to-human characteristics which is attributed to the interaction between s protein and host cell surface receptors sars-cov and sars-cov-2 use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor15

16 whereas mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 as a receptor17 the distribution of receptors in humans and their affinity with s proteins determine the extent of tissue tropism and the intensity of transmission of coronavirus the epidemiology and biological characteristics of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are summarized in table 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8

12

15 16 17 s protein is a large type i transmembrane glycoprotein whose trimers constitute the spike structure on the surface of the virus the s protein fig 1b can be divided into two functional subunits an n-terminal s1 domain contains signal peptide and receptor binding domain rbd and a c-terminal s2 domain contains fusion peptide and two heptapeptide repeats hr1 and hr2 to facilitate viral fusion rbd mediates the binding of virus and cell receptor which then triggers a conformational change of the s protein exposing hr1 and hr2 to form a 6-helix bundle fusion core structure further leading to membrane fusion and viral rna release18 19 20 21 furthermore s protein carries b-cell epitopes which induces the body to produce neutralizing antibody and provides immune protection22 because the s protein is involved in viral infection and is responsible for inducing host immune response and virus-neutralizing antibodies it has been considered a key target for vaccine design antigen-specific targets of s protein include full-length s protein s1 subunits rbd and s2 subunits viral vector vaccines encoding full-length s protein or s1 subunits have been demonstrated to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in various animal models23

24 however some non-neutralizing epitopes on full-length s protein or s1 subunits may compete with neutralizing epitopes leading to several safety concerns including inflammatory and immunopathological effects such as pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration and antibody-dependent enhancement ade following subsequent viral challenge of vaccinated animals22

25

26 ade is a phenomenon in which non-neutralizing antibodies are produced following an infection or a vaccination leads to enhanced infection27 one approach to mitigate the adverse effects of ade is to narrow the immune response to target only critical or beneficial epitopes28 vaccines based on rbd elicited a robust protective immune response and neutralizing antibodies at the same time rbd does not contain non-neutralizing epitopes that may cause harmful immune responses which is a hot spot for cov vaccine development it is worth mentioning that rbd has relatively low immunogenicity and often requires repeated doses and adjuvants29 30 31 because the s2 subunit is highly conserved and not prone to mutation s2 region has become an important target for the development of protective vaccines however reports regarding the presence of neutralizing epitopes in s2 and a protective role for antibodies to s2 have been inconsistent several studies demonstrated that s2 domain could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total igg but little neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus infection32

33 on the contrary there are also reports that showed that s2 domain contains neutralizing epitopes and could induce neutralizing antibodies34

35 n protein serves multiple functions in viral replication transcription and assembly of the viral genome complex which is more conservative than other proteins such as s and m therefore n protein has been also widely reported as a target antigen n proteins have been shown to be highly immunogenic and capable of triggering t cell responses36 remarkably many studies indicated that the serum containing anti-n protein does not contain neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus infection37

38 in addition vaccines based on n protein not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of sars-cov-challenged mice39

 sars or mers inactivated by physical ultraviolet or radiation or chemical methanol -propiolactone and formalin methods has been shown to cause high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity in several animal models including mice rabbit and ferret47 48 49 however eosinophil infiltration in the lungs of animals vaccinated with inactivated sars-cov vaccine or mers-cov vaccine has raised concerns about the safety and ultimate protective efficacy of inactivated vaccine50

51 in addition a double-inactivated sars-cov doubly inactivated by formalin and uv irradiation vaccine provides poor protection against lethal disease in aged-animal models following heterologous challenge52 this result may be attributed to respiratory dendritic cells rdcs migration to draining lymph nodes dlns progressively decreases as mice age decreases in virus-specific cd8 t cell responses in lungs and more severe disease in older mice infected with sars-cov53

54 based on the above results candidate vaccines against emerging coronaviruses should emphasize the efficacy in older animal with virus infection the live-attenuated virus vaccine composed of recombinant sars-cov lacking the e gene rsars-cov-e produces significant neutralizing antibodies and virus-specific t cell responses55

56 more recently a live attenuated sars-cov was generated through mutation of transcription regulatory networks trns where the attenuated virus effectively limits virulence reversal and protects mice against challenge57 another study reported that rmers-cov-e a mutant of the mers-cov prepared using a new dna cloning vector system only replicates in a small number of cells but can produce enough antigen to stimulate protective immunity in the host58 although vaccine candidates based on the live-attenuated coronaviruses have the potential to induce a highly effective immune response and protection it may present biosafety problems associated with virulence recovery55 nucleic acid vaccines including dna and rna vaccines are based on plasmids or messenger rna that encode vaccine antigens and they are introduced into the host to produce immunological response to protect organisms against diseases59 the efficacy of dna-based vaccines against sars-cov and mers-cov infections has been widely evaluated in a phase i clinical trial a sars dna vaccine produces cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibody in healthy adults60 additionally a dna vaccine encoding the mers-cov s protein induces strong cd8 and cd4 t cell immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice camels and nonhuman primates nhps and protects vaccinated rhesus macaques from infection by mers-cov61

62 gls-5300 a dna vaccine expressing mers-cov s-protein antigen is the first mers-cov vaccine to advance into human trials the vaccine induced durable immune responses as most participants maintained detectable s1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination63 nevertheless cov dna vaccines based on full-length s protein may cause a th2-related harmful immune response leading to liver damage in vaccinated animals one study comparing the immunogenicity of mers-cov dna vaccines expressing s or s1 in mice showed that plasmids expressing the s1 ps1 subunit triggered a balanced th1th2 response thereby avoiding the risk of immunopathological risk associated with th2 response64 moreover immunization of mice with ps1 vaccine induced significantly higher levels of ifn- compared to ps vaccine64 messenger rna mrna vaccines carry transcripts encoding antigens and use the host cell translational machinery to produce the antigens which then stimulates an immune response65 because of high yields of in vitro transcription reactions mrna has the potential for rapid inexpensive and scalable manufacturing which greatly shortens the development time and can respond quickly to epidemics compared to dna vaccines mrna vaccines do not need to pass an additional membrane barrier nuclear membrane so it does not have safety concerns about integration into the host genome66 due to the above advantages mrna vaccines are becoming a powerful tool against coronavirus infection however their application has been restricted by the instability and inefficient in vivo delivery of nucleic acid dna or mrna67

68 to provide protection from degradation and facilitate their entry into targeted cells efficient delivery systems for nucleic acid vaccines particularly the nanocarriers have been explored extensively viral vectors have a molecular mechanism that assists the target gene to enter cells and infect them which is an important vector platform for cov candidate vaccines viral vector-based vaccines encoding s protein of mers-cov and sars-cov have been widely studied to date adenovirus ad modified vaccinia ankara mva attenuated parainfluenza virus bhpiv3 and rabies virus rv have been used as vaccine vector69 70 71 72 73 a previous report has indicated sars-cov s-specific neutralizing antibodies and mucosal responses are elicited in african green monkeys immunized with bhpiv3sars-s vector vaccines protecting african green monkeys against sars-cov infection69 another study reported that a single inoculation with the rv-based vaccine expressing sars-cov s protein can induce a strong sars-cov-neutralizing antibody response70 in addition mers-cov s-specific neutralizing antibodies and antigen specific t cell response are induced in mice after immunizing them with human adenovirus or mva-based mers-cov s-expressing vaccines71

72 furthermore compared with mers-cov s-encoding ad5 vaccines mers-cov s1-encoding ad5 vaccines might induce higher levels of neutralizing antibodies73 in a recent study rad5 constructs expressing cd40-targeted s1 fusion protein rad5-s1fcd40l exhibited full protection against lethal mers-cov challenge and prevented severe perivascular hemorrhage within the lungs as compared to non cd40-targeted vaccine rad5-s174 currently mers-cov s protein expressed by chimpanzee adenovirus chadox1 or modified vaccinia ankara mva vectors are at phase i clinical trial75

76 indeed viral vectors expressing s protein can induce viral neutralizing antibodies in vivo providing an effective platform for the development of sars-cov-2 vaccine however some viral-vectors such as certain serotypes of adenoviruses may fail to induce effective immune responses owing to the high prevalence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the human population resulting in elimination of viral vectors77 thus caution should be taken when developing cov vaccines using viral vectors virus-like particles vlps are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of native viruses but devoid of infectious genetic materials vlp is a potential candidate for the development of safe and effective cov vaccines which can efficiently stimulate innate and adaptive immune response functions bacterial insect yeast and mammalian cells expression systems have been widely used in the production of vlps one study indicated a chimeric vlps that coexpression of sars-cov s protein and e m and n proteins of mouse hepatitis virus resulted in the efficient production of neutralizing antibodies thus inhibiting sars-cov replication in the lung78 the other chimeric vlps expressing sars-cov s protein and influenza m1 protein can induce neutralizing antibodies and protect mice against deadly challenges79 similar as sars-cov vlp vaccines that induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies against cov infection mers-cov vlp vaccines also elicit antigen specific cellular immune response against infections of mers-cov80 the vlp vaccine is a potential tool to provide protection against novel pandemic pathogens however vlps as a preventive vaccine still have many problems to be considered for example viral mutations might allow the virus to evade antibody-mediated neutralization subunit vaccines are composed of highly purified antigens which require only a part of the pathogen to generate a protective immune response subunit vaccines are characterized by high security controllable performance and easy production on a large scale thereby gradually becoming the focus of more and more researchers compared to the full-length s protein rbd contains several critical neutralizing epitopes and lacks non-neutralizing epitopes that may cause harmful pathological responses therefore rbd-based subunit vaccines not only can induce effective neutralizing antibodies but also avoid adverse immune responses from the safety and effectiveness perspectives the rbd-based cov vaccines are more attractive candidates in the development of cov vaccines since the sars and mers outbreaks subunit vaccines based on sars-cov and mers-cov rbd have been extensively studied and tested showing sufficient effectiveness and strong protection against cov infection in various animal models81 82 83 84 85 for example rbd-fc rbd fused with human igg1 fc elicits long-term humoral immune response and produces neutralizing antibodies that protects the vaccinated mice from the sars-cov challenge without causing immunopathological damage81 also a newly designed rbd without the fc tag induces robust humoral and t cell responses particularly neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice protecting mice against sars-cov infection82 it has been demonstrated that s377-588-fc which is a fusion protein of rbd fragment s377-588 spike residues 377588 and human igg1 fc induces the higher-titer igg antibodies and neutralizing antibodies among all rbd fragments in mice83 a study has also shown that in vaccination of mers-cov rbd-fc induces humoral igg antibody response comparable to those induced by sc vaccination including neutralizing antibodies but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and higher local mucosal immune responses in mouse lungs84 in the rhesus macaque a recombinant receptor-binding domain rrbd protein vaccine can also induce sustained and robust immunological responses85 these studies suggest that rbd-based cov vaccines have potential for preventing respiratory infections caused by cov further enhancing beneficial strategies for emerging coronavirus infection however it is worth noting that highly purified proteins are generally low immunogenicity and often require the addition of vaccine adjuvants to summarize an effective vaccine against coronavirus infection often needs to induce the body to produce strong humoral immune response and cellular immune response the current advancements and vaccine strategies in the development of in the development of sars-cov vaccines and mers-cov vaccines are listed in table 2

 apart from inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines nucleic acid- viral vector- and vlps-based vaccines particularly subunit vaccines containing the rbd of cov s protein are critically important aluminum alum adjuvant is the longest and most frequently used adjuvant in licensed vaccines with an extensive safety record alum is a th2-type adjuvant that induces strong humoral immune response including the production of neutralizing antibodies86 therefore alum is incorporated into a range of vaccines against viral infection where neutralizing antibodies to viral antigens are required for protection including human papillomavirus rabies and hepatitis b87 aluminum adjuvant has been widely used in the development of cov vaccine due to a variety of advantages noted above several studies have indicated that rbd-based subunit vaccines in the presence of alum induce powerful serum-specific and neutralizing antibodies providing a degree of protection against viral challenges85

88 it is noteworthy to mention that eliciting powerful cellular and humoral immunity is critical for a potential cov vaccine virus-specific t cells can secrete ifn- and promote virus clearance meanwhile effector t cells can further differentiate into memory t cells which is expected to respond quickly and effectively to subsequent cov infection89

90 although alum successfully induces antibody-mediated protective immunity its ability to induce cellular immune responses is limited one approach to overcome the limitations of alum is to use it in combination with other adjuvants to enhance cellular immune responses another approach that has an extensive history of use as cov vaccine adjuvants are emulsions freunds adjuvant is a water-in-oil emulsion divided into complete freunds adjuvant cfa and incomplete freunds adjuvant ifa as a powerful agonist for th1 cells cfa can induce th1 cytokines and enhance cellular and humoral immune responses while ifa generally induce th2 cytokines91 92 93 mice immunized with sars-cov rrbd antigen together with freunds adjuvant induce not just high titer of neutralizing antibodies but relatively high levels of ctl and th responses94 freunds adjuvant induces a more balanced th1 and th2 immune response providing more comprehensive protection against coronavirus infection freunds adjuvant is not approved for use in human vaccines due to its toxicity95 despite this montanide isa-51 also known as incomplete freunds adjuvant ifa has been approved for human use in 201296

97 similar as classic freunds water emulsion the addition of montanide isa-51 in rbd-based vaccines can produce strong antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies response against cov infection83

98 the toxicity of freunds adjuvant mainly comes from the non-degradable oil in the ingredients to avoid the toxicity problem of freunds adjuvant oil-in-water emulsions prepared from biocompatible oils such as squalene eg sas and mf59 were developed99 100 101 the sigma adjuvant system sas is a stable oil-in-water emulsion containing monophosphoryl lipid a which has been used in animal experiments one study indicated that the sars-cov rrbd protein with sas protect mouse against lethal sars-cov challenge where the protection correlated well with the high titer of neutralizing antibodies102 in addition mers-cov s1 protein together with sas was identified to elicit robust serum neutralizing activity against several mers-cov strains in immunized mice103 mf59 another squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion has been licensed in europe for adjuvanted influenza vaccines it is revealed that mers-cov rbd in trimeric form with mf59 elicits highly efficacious th2-based igg1 and th1-based igg2 antibody responses as well as neutralizing antibodies against pseudotyped and live mers-cov protecting 83 of hdpp4-tg mice from lethal mers-cov infection fig 4
99 100 101 similarly the activation of igg subtype antibody response and production of neutralizing antibodies following immunization with rbd-fc and mf59 resulting in the fully protection against mers-cov infection105 additionally mf59 induces stronger and broader igg subtype antibody response than several other commercial adjuvants including freunds adjuvant aluminum monophosphoryl lipid a and montanide isa5199 100 101 based on the security and effectiveness of mf59 it becomes a promising candidate adjuvant for the development of coronavirus subunit vaccine the innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps mainly through pattern recognition receptors prrs as one of the best characterized prrs toll-like receptors tlrs which are widely distributed in antigen presenting cells and play an important role in triggering innate immunity and priming the adaptive immune response107 therefore several tlr agonists have been investigating as virus-specific vaccine adjuvants to induce strong and sustained immune responses108

109 the toll-like receptor tlr families have been characterized as key players in rna virus detection and antiviral immunity polyinosinic acidpolycytidylic acid polyic is a synthetic double-stranded rna dsrna analogue that acts as a tlr3 receptor agonist inducing the production of type i ifn and inflammatory cytokines through a trif-dependent pathway110 previous reports have indicated mice deficient in the tlr3 signaling way are extremely susceptible to sars-cov infection showing increased lung pathology and higher viral titers111 additionally intranasal treatment with polyic induces both innate and t cell immune responses against viral infections protecting aged animals from infection by iav or sars-cov as well as providing more rapid virus clearance112 furthermore mers-cov s protein together with poly ic effectively trigger cd8 t-cells response to accelerate mers-cov clearance without immunopathological effects113 these results suggest that polyic a potent type i ifn inducer should be evaluated as a promising adjuvant in cov subunit vaccines tlr4 mainly recognizes lipopolysaccharide lps derived from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria unlike other tlrs tlr4 agonists mediate the production of inflammatory cytokines and type i ifn via myd88 as well as trif signaling pathway114 it has been demonstrated that pretreatment with tlr4 ligands provides protective immunity against infections by sars-cov112 monophosphoryl lipid a mplaa tlr4 agonistis an attenuated version of lipopolysaccharide lps mpla has proven its safety and effectiveness in licensed vaccines including human papillomavirus and hepatitis b vaccines115

116 previous work has shown that inclusion of mpla as an adjuvant in influenza vaccine promotes mucosal and systemic th1-skewed immune responses after pulmonary vaccination117 in addition sars-cov s protein with adjuvanated tlr3 and tlr4 agonists successfully induce high expression of antigen-specific igg and neutralizing antibodies without eosinophilic infiltrations and elicit th117 cytokine responses in the lungs after the sars-cov challenge infection in the mouse model118 the above results indicated that tlr4 agonist as a powerful th1-type adjuvant can effectively improve the immunogenicity of the cov subunit vaccines and reduce the th2-related eosinophilic pathological response tlr9 recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine cpg motifs that are commonly found in bacterial and viral dna and then mediates the antiviral response of type i ifn via the tlr9-myd88 pathway119 cpg-containing oligodeoxynucleotides cpg odn sequence 1018 as an adjuvant for immunization against hepatitis b virus hbv has been proven to significantly increase neutralizing antibody titers in clinical trials120 recently it has been approved for adults in the united states121 a novel cpg odn bw001 has been shown to effectively activate b and nk cells and stimulate the body to secrete high level of ifn-a and ifn- thereby producing strong anti-sars-cov activity122 furthermore cpg have been identified to be superior to other tlr agonists tlr3 agonists polyic tlr78 agonists r848 in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and activation of sars-cov s peptide specific cd8 t cell response123 due to the strong ability of cpg to induce cellular immunity it is often used in combination with alum to supplement the defects of alum in inducing cellular immunity for instance mice immunized with sars-cov s protein amino acids 318510 s318510 together with alum and cpg odn show higher humoral and cellular immune responses than those immunized with s318510 antigen and alum alone fig 5

124 the above findings suggest that cpg can be used as a potent adjuvant for coronavirus vaccines sting stimulator of interferon genes a central component in the innate immune response plays an important role in defense against viral and intracellular bacterial infections sting is a transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum following stimulation by cytosolic cyclic dinucleotides cdns sting undergoes a conformational change resulting in a downstream signaling cascade involving the activation of nf-b signaling pathway and the production of type i interferon125

126 sting agonists are potent adjuvants capable of eliciting robust humoral and cd8 t cell immune responses in mice by simulating the early phase of viral infection without concomitant excess inflammation127 meanwhile recombinant mers-cov rbd antigens with cyclic diguanylate monophosphate cdgmp a canonical sting agonist have shown to effectively elicit neutralization antibody and antigenspecific t cell responses128

 to summarize the application of vaccine adjuvant requires a thorough understanding of the effect of adjuvants on immune response and mechanisms of action the application of adjuvants in subunit vaccines are listed in table 3

128 in addition to safety considerations the design of adjuvants must also pay attention to the ability to selectively induce and regulate the types of immune responses in the body so as to effectively promote the humoral and cellular immunity to combat coronavirus infection it is also noteworthy to mention that an existing well-established adjuvant could be combined with new immunostimulants eg tlrs agonist to improve the breadth and intensity of the immune responses which has become a potential strategy for exploring efficient adjuvant systems sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly since its outbreak and has now posed a risk to countries worldwide making it urgent to develop a safe and effective vaccine against the infection this review introduces the structure and functions of coronavirus s protein and summarizes the advancements and potential strategies of sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines based on cov s protein the cov s protein-based vaccines are further classified into different types including viral vector nucleic acid dna and rna vlp and protein-based vaccines subunit vaccines have become the focus of current research due to their numerous advantages but it often requires appropriate adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity in the usa aluminum mf59 and cpg are adjuvants included in licensed vaccines these three adjuvants have shown induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and protection against infection in mice challenged with an infectious virus which might be used for cov subunit vaccine administration85

123 however alum alone cannot induce a potent th1 response unless combined with another adjuvant such as cpg this adjuvant combination will improve the effectiveness of the cov subunit vaccines124 similarly in order to effectively activate the complex and orderly natural immune system and produce the expected acquired immune response it is sometimes necessary to use an adjuvant combination30 here we believe that adjuvant formulations that induce a balanced th1 and th2 immune response can more effectively improve the immunogenicity of the antigen73

84

104 becoming a new trend in the development of coronavirus adjuvants ideally an effective cov vaccine is required to induce both robust humoral and cell-mediated immunities even though many promising vaccine candidates have been reported there are still no commercial vaccines available against sars-cov and mers-cov the comprehensive lessons and experiences brought by the outbreak of sars and mers provide valuable insights and progress on how to respond to covid-19 with the spread of covid-19 scientific institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world are racing against time to develop sars-cov-2 vaccine according to who there are at least 100 research projects on sars-cov-2 vaccines in the world129 in addition to traditional inactivated virus and live-attenuated virus vaccines the developments of most sars-cov-2 vaccines are also based on some new technological routes such as mrna vaccines subunit vaccines viral vector vaccines and dna vaccines up to now eight candidate vaccines have entered clinical trials including three inactivated vaccines from wuhan institute of biological products130 beijing institute of biological products131 and sinovac132 two adenovirus vector vaccines ad5-ncov from cansino biologicals133 and cov001 from inovio134 two mrna vaccines mrna-1273 from moderna135 and bnt162 from biontech136 and one dna vaccine ino-4800 from inovio137 although some progress has been made in the development of sars-cov-2 vaccines it is important to realize that vaccine development is a rigorous scientific exploration process due to many challenges of verifying the effectiveness of vaccines it is still very likely that no sars-cov-2 vaccine will be available in the market for human in near future therefore sars-cov-2 vaccine development still requires the unremitting efforts of researchers in the world chunting he and ming qin collected and reorganized the literature material chunting he wrote the manuscript xun sun

weiner b kate broderick e   covid-19 known previously as 2019-ncov pneumonia or disease has emerged as a global public health crisis joining severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in a growing number of coronavirus-associated illnesses which have jumped from animals to people there are at least seven identified coronaviruses that infect humans in december 2019 the city of wuhan in china became the epicenter for an outbreak of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 was isolated and sequenced from human airway epithelial cells from infected patients12 disease symptoms range from mild flu-like to severe cases with life-threatening pneumonia3 the global situation is dynamically evolving and on 30 january 2020 the world health organization declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern pheic and on 11 march 2020 it was declared a global pandemic as of 1 may 2020 there are 3321402 people confirmed infected and 237180 deaths4 infections have spread to multiple continents human-to-human transmission has been observed in multiple countries and a shortage of disposable personal protective equipment5 and prolonged survival times of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces6 have compounded this already delicate situation and heightened the risk of nosocomial infections advanced research activities must be pursued in parallel to push forward protective modalities in an effort to protect billions of vulnerable individuals worldwide currently no licensed preventative vaccine is available for covid-19 to address the urgent need for a medical countermeasure to prevent the further dissemination of sars-cov-2 we have employed a synthetic dna-based vaccine approach synthetic dna vaccines are amenable to accelerated developmental timelines due to the ability to quickly design multiple candidates for preclinical testing scalable manufacturing of large quantities of the drug product and the possibility to leverage established regulatory pathways to the clinic synthetic dna is temperature-stable and cold-chain free important features for delivery to resource-limited settings7 specifically for the development of a covid-19 vaccine candidate we leveraged prior experiences in developing vaccine approaches to sars-cov8 and our own experience in developing a mers-cov vaccine ino-4700910 as well as taking advantage of our vaccine design and manufacturing pathway previously utilized for the zika vaccine candidate gls-570011 which was advanced to the clinic in under 7 months ino-4700 and gls-5700 vaccines are currently in clinical testing prior work has demonstrated that a dna approach for sars and mers can drive neutralizing antibody nab responses and provide protection in challenge models810 our previous studies indicated immunization of small and large animal models with dna vaccines encoding mers-cov spike s protein provided protection against disease challenge with the matched virus in subjects immunized with ino-4700 mers-cov s protein dna vaccine durable neutralizing antibodies nabs and t cell immune responses were measured and a seroconversion rate of 96 was observed and immunity was followed for 60 weeks in most study volunteers9 ino-4700 phase 12a testing is continuing in south korea and a larger phase 2 study is being planned to begin in the middle east both areas which have been most affected by mers infections the sars-cov-2 spike is most similar in sequence and structure to sars-cov spike protein12 and shares a global protein fold architecture with the mers-cov spike protein fig 1 allowing us to build on our prior vaccine construct design10 unlike glycoproteins of hiv and influenza the prefusion form of the coronavirus trimeric spike is conformationally dynamic fully exposing the receptor-binding site infrequently13 the receptor-binding site is a vulnerable target for nabs in fact mers nabs targeted at the receptor-binding domain rbd tend to have greater neutralizing potency than other epitopes14 a recent report demonstrated that an anti-sars antibody could cross-react to the rbd of sars-cov-215 these data suggest that the sars-cov-2 rbd is an important target for vaccine development recent data has revealed sars-cov-2 s protein binds the same host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as sars-cov s protein12 here we describe the design and initial preclinical testing of covid-19 synthetic dna vaccine candidates we show the expression of the sars-cov-2 s antigen rna and protein after in vitro transfection of cos-7 and 293t cells respectively with the vaccine candidates we followed the induction of immunity by the selected immunogen in mice and guinea pigs measuring sars-cov-2 s protein-specific antibody levels in serum and in the lung fluid and antibody functionality through competitive inhibition of ace2 binding pseudovirus and live virus neutralization the ino-4800 vaccine induces cellular and humoral host immune responses that can be observed within days following a single immunization including cross-reactive responses against sars-cov the data demonstrate the immunogenicity of this covid-19 synthetic dna vaccine candidate targeting the sars-cov-2 s protein supporting further translational studies to advance the development of this candidate in response to the current global health crisis four spike protein sequences were retrieved from the first four available sars-cov-2 full genome sequences published on gisaid global initiative on sharing all influenza data three spike sequences were 100 matched and one was considered an outlier 986 sequence identity with the other sequences after performing a sequence alignment the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein sequence was generated and an n-terminal ige leader sequence was added the highly optimized dna sequence encoding sars-cov-2 ige-spike was created using inovios proprietary in silico gene optimization algorithm to enhance expression and immunogenicity the optimized dna sequence was synthesized digested with bamhi and xhoi and cloned into the expression vector pgx0001 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal the resulting plasmids were designated as pgx9501 and pgx9503 designed to encode the sars-cov-2 s protein from the three-matched sequences and the outlier sequence respectively fig 2a we measured the expression of the encoded sars-cov-2 spike transgene at the rna level in cos-7 cells transfected with pgx9501 and pgx9503 using the total rna extracted from the transfected cos-7 cells we confirmed expression of the spike transgene by rt-pcr fig 2b in vitro spike protein expression in hek-293t cells was measured by western blot analysis using a cross-reactive antibody against sars-cov s protein on cell lysates western blots of the lysates of hek-293t cells transfected with pgx9501 or pgx9503 constructs revealed bands approximate to the predicted s protein molecular weight 140142 kda with slight shifts likely due to the 22 potential n-linked glycans in the s protein fig 2c in immunofluorescent studies the s protein was detected in 293t cells transfected with pgx9501 or pgx9503 fig 2d in summary in vitro studies revealed the expression of the spike protein at both the rna and protein level after transfection of cell lines with the candidate vaccine constructs since candidate design it has been observed that newly published sars-cov-2 spike protein sequences match pgx9501 with 999 amino acid sequence identity supplementary data 1 pgx9501 was therefore selected as the vaccine construct to advance to immunogenicity studies due to the broader coverage it would likely provide compared with the outlier pgx9503 pgx9501 was subsequently termed ino-4800 the immunogenicity of ino-4800 was evaluated in balbc mice post-administration to the tibialis anterior muscle using the cellectra delivery device16 the reactivity of the sera from a group of mice immunized with ino-4800 was measured against a panel of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov antigens fig 3a analysis revealed igg binding against sars-cov-2 s protein antigens with limited cross-reactivity to sars-cov s protein antigens in the sera of ino-4800 immunized mice we measured the serum igg binding endpoint titers epts in mice immunized with pdna against recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein s1  s2 regions fig 3b c and recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein receptor binding domain rbd fig 3d e epts were observed in the sera of mice at day 14 after immunization with a single dose of ino-4800 fig 3c e we developed a neutralization assay with a pnl43lucr-e-based pseudovirus displaying the sars-cov-2 spike protein neutralization titers were detected by a reduction in relative luciferase units rlu compared with controls which had no decrease in rlu signal balbc mice were immunized twice with ino-4800 on days 0 and 14 and sera was collected on day 7 post-second immunization the pseudovirus was incubated with serial dilutions of mouse sera and the sera-virus mixture was added to 293t cells stably expressing the human ace2 receptor ace2-293t for 72 h neutralization id50 average titers of 922 were observed in ino-4800 immunized mice fig 4a b no reduction in rlu was observed for the control animals neutralizing titers were additionally measured against two wildtype sars-cov-2 virus strains by prnt assay sera from ino-4800 immunized balbc mice neutralized both sars-cov-2wh-09human2020 and sars-cov-2australiavic012020 virus strains with average nd50 titers of 975 and 1281 respectively table 1 live virus neutralizing titers were also evaluated in c57bl6 mice following the same ino-4800 immunization regimen sera from ino-4800 immunized c57bl6 mice neutralized wildtype sars-cov-2 virus with average nd50 titer of 340 table 1 we assessed the immunogenicity of ino-4800 in the hartley guinea pig model an established model for intradermal vaccine delivery1718 one hundred micrograms of pdna was administered by mantoux injection to the skin and followed by cellectra delivery device on day 0 as described in the methods section on day 14 anti-spike protein binding of serum antibodies was measured by elisa immunization with ino-4800 revealed an immune response in respect to sars-cov-2 s1  2 protein binding igg levels in the sera fig 5a b the endpoint sars-cov-2 s protein binding titer at day 14 was 10530 and 21 in guinea pigs treated with 100 g ino-4800 or pvax control respectively fig 5b we next evaluated antibody neutralizing activity following intradermal ino-4800 immunization in the guinea pig model guinea pigs were treated on days 0 14 and 28 with pvax or ino-4800 and sera samples were collected on days 35 or 42 to measure sera neutralizing activity against pseudovirus or wildtype virus respectively sars-cov-2 pseudovirus neutralizing activity with average nd50 titers of 5735 was observed for the ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs table 1 wildtype sars-cov-2 virus activity was also observed for the ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs with nd50 titers 320 by prnt assay observed in all animals table 1 the induction of antibodies capable of inhibiting spike protein engagement of host receptor is considered relevant for sars-cov-2 vaccine development we therefore examined the receptor inhibiting functionality of ino-4800-induced antibody responses we recently developed an elisa-based ace2 inhibition assay as a surrogate for neutralization the assay is similar in principle to other surrogate neutralization assays which have been validated for coronaviruses19 as a control in our assay we show ace2 can bind to sars-cov-2 spike protein with an ec50 of 0025 gml fig 6a balbc mice were immunized on days 0 and day 14 with 10 g of ino-4800 and serum igg was purified on day 21 post-immunization to ensure inhibition is antibody-mediated we compared inhibition of the spike-ace2 interaction using serum igg from a nave mouse and from an ino-4800 vaccinated mouse fig 6b we repeated the receptor inhibition assay with a group of five immunized mice and demonstrating that ino-4800-induced antibodies competed with ace2 binding to the sars-cov-2 spike protein fig 6c and supplementary fig 1 ace2 binding inhibition was further evaluated in the guinea pig model sera collected from ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs inhibited binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein over range of concentrations of ace2 025 gml through 4 gml fig 6d furthermore serum dilution curves revealed sera collected from ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs blocked binding of ace2 to sars-cov-2 in a dilution-dependent manner fig 6e sera collected from pvax-treated animals displayed negligible activity in the inhibition of ace2 binding to the virus protein the decrease in od signal at the highest concentration of serum is considered a matrix effect in the assay ace2 is considered to be the primary receptor for sars-cov-2 cellular entry and blocking this interaction suggests ino-4800-induced antibodies believed important to prevent host infection in summary humoral immunogenicity testing in both mice and guinea pigs revealed the covid-19 vaccine candidate ino-4800 was capable of eliciting functional blocking antibody responses to sars-cov-2 spike protein lower respiratory disease lrd is associated with severe cases of covid-19 the presence of antibodies at the lung mucosa targeting sars-cov-2 could potentially mediate protection against lrd therefore we evaluated the presence of sars-cov-2 specific antibody in the lungs of immunized mice and guinea pigs balbc mice and hartley guinea pigs were immunized on days 0 and 14 or 0 14 and 28 respectively with ino-4800 or pvax control pdna bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid was collected following sacrifice and sars-cov-2 s protein elisas were performed in both balbc and hartley guinea pigs which received ino-4800 we measured a statistically significant increase in sars-cov-2 s protein binding igg in bal fluid compared with animals receiving pvax control fig 7ad taken together these data demonstrate the presence of anti-sars-cov-2 specific antibody in the lungs following immunization with ino-4800 we assayed t cell responses against sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov s antigens by ifn- elispot groups of balbc mice were sacrificed at days 4 7 or 10 post-ino-4800 administration 25 or 10 g of pdna splenocytes were harvested and a single-cell suspension was stimulated for 20 h with pools of 15-mer overlapping peptides spanning the sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov spike protein day 7 post-ino-4800 administration we measured t cell responses of 205 and 552 sfu per 106 splenocytes against sars-cov-2 for the 25 and 10 g doses respectively fig 8a higher magnitude responses of 852 and 2193 sfu per 106 splenocytes against sars-cov-2 were observed on day 10 post-ino-4800 administration additionally we assayed the cross-reactivity of the cellular response elicited by ino-4800 against sars-cov observing detectable albeit lower t cell responses on both day 7 74 25 g dose and 140 10 g dose sfu per 106 splenocytes and day 10 post-administration 242 25 g dose and 588 10 g dose sfu per 106 splenocytes fig 8b interestingly no cross-reactive t cell responses were observed against mers-cov peptides fig 8c representative images of the ifn- elispot plates are provided in supplementary fig 2 we proceeded to identify the t cell populations which were producing ifn- flow cytometric analysis on splenocytes harvested from balbc mice on day 14 after a single ino-4800 immunization revealed the t cell compartment to contain 004 cd4 and 032 cd8 ifn- t cells after stimulation with sars-cov-2 antigens supplementary fig 3 we performed epitope mapping on the splenocytes from balbc mice receiving the 10 g ino-4800 dose thirty matrix mapping pools were used to stimulate splenocytes for 20 h and immunodominant responses were detected in multiple peptide pools fig 9a the responses were deconvoluted to identify several epitopes h2-kd clustering in the receptor binding domain and in the s2 domain fig 9b interestingly one sars-cov-2 h2-kd epitope phgvvflhv was observed to be overlapping and adjacent to the sars-cov human hla-a2 restricted epitope vvflhvtyv20 in summary t cell responses against sars-cov-2 s protein epitopes were detected in mice immunized with ino-4800 the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and associated covid-19 disease has become a global pandemic with a significant morbidity and mortality toll currently there are no covid-19 vaccines available and global dissemination of sars-cov-2 may continue until there is a high level of herd immunity within the human population here we have described the preclinical development of a synthetic dna-based covid-19 vaccine ino-4800 to combat this emerging infectious disease synthetic dna vaccine design and synthesis was immediately initiated upon public release of the sars-cov-2 genome sequences on 11 january 2020 our data support the expression and immunogenicity of the ino-4800 synthetic dna vaccine candidate in multiple animal models humoral and t cell responses were observed in mice in guinea pigs we employed clinical delivery parameters and observed sars-cov-2 s protein binding antibody titers and blocking of ace2sars-cov-2 s protein interaction in serum samples from ino-4800-treated animals nabs were also measured in both species halting a rapidly emerging infectious disease requires an orchestrated response from the global health community and requires improved strategies to accelerate vaccine development in response to the 20192020 coronavirus outbreak we employed a synthetic dna medicine platform the design and manufacture of this synthetic dna vaccine represents a plug and play process in which we insert the target antigen sequence into a highly characterized and clinically tested plasmid vector backbone pgx0001 the construct design and engineering parameters have been optimized for in vivo gene expression and previously applied to mers ebov zika and lassa dna vaccine constructs which are all undergoing clinical testing79112122 based upon our previous experience developing a vaccine against mers coronavirus and previous published studies of sars vaccines sars-cov-2 s protein was chosen as the antigen target the sars-cov-2 s protein is a class i membrane fusion protein which the major envelope protein on the surface of coronaviruses initial studies have already been performed which indicate sars-cov-2 interaction with its host receptor ace2 can be blocked by antibodies23 in vivo immunogenicity studies in both mouse and guinea pig models revealed levels of s protein-reactive igg in the serum of ino-4800 immunized animals in addition to full-length s1  s2 and s1 ino-4800 immunization induced rbd binding antibodies fig 3 a domain known to be a target for nabs from sars-cov convalescent patients2425 we further demonstrate the functionality of these antibodies through neutralization of sars-cov-2 wild-type virus and pseudovirus table 1 and competitive inhibition of sars-cov-2 spike protein binding to the ace2 receptor in the presence of sera from ino-4800 immunized animals fig 6 importantly anti-sars-cov-2 binding antibodies were detected in lung washes of ino-4800-immunized mice and guinea pigs fig 7 the presence of these antibodies in the lungs has the potential to protect against infection of these tissues and prevent lrd which is associated with the severe cases of covid-19 in addition to humoral responses cellular immune responses have been shown to be associated with more favorable recovery in mers-cov infection26 and are likely to be important against sars-cov infection27 here we showed the induction of t cell responses against sars-cov-2 as early as day 7 post-vaccine delivery rapid cellular responses have the potential to lower viral load and could potentially reduce the spread of sars-cov-2 and the associated covid-19 illness we believe synthetic dna medicine platform has several synergistic characteristics which position it well to respond to disease outbreaks such as covid-19 as mentioned previously the ability to design and immediately synthesize candidate vaccine constructs means that in vitro and in vivo testing can potentially begin within days of receiving the viral sequence the dna plasmid manufacture process allows for scalable manufacture of drug product which has the potential to circumvent the complexities of conventional vaccine production in eggs or cell culture additionally we have published on the stability profile afforded to these products through the use of our optimized dna formulation7 the stability characteristics mean that our dna drug product is non-frozen and can be stored for 45 years at 28 c room temperature rt for 1 year and 1 month at 37 c while maintaining potency at temperatures upwards of 60 c in the context of a pandemic outbreak the stability profile of a vaccine plays directly to its ability to be deployed and stockpiled in an efficient and executable manner in this study we observed seroconversion after a single intradermal administration of the ino-4800 in guinea pigs fig 6 whether a single immunization will be sufficient in humans will be investigated in clinical trials although vaccine-induced immunopathology has been raised as a potential concern for sars and mers vaccine candidates and possibly for sars-cov-2 vaccines these concerns are likely vaccine-platform dependent and to-date no evidence of immune pathogenesis has been reported for mers dna vaccines in mice or non-human primate models10 or sars dna vaccines in mice8 lung immunopathology characterized by th2-related eosinophilia has been reported for whole inactivated virus iv recombinant protein peptide andor recombinant viral vector vaccines following sars-cov challenge2832 and more recently in a mers-cov challenge model33 however in the majority of studies protective efficacy without lung immunopathology has been reported for sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines8103440 it is important to note the majority of studies demonstrating cov vaccine-induced immunopathology utilized the balbc mouse a model known to preferentially develop th2-type responses the dna vaccine platform induces th1-type immune responses and has demonstrated efficacy without immunopathology in models of respiratory infection including sars-cov8 mers-cov10 and rsv41 sars-cov-2 animal challenge studies will assess ino-4800-mediated protection against disease and vaccine-enhanced disease here we report functional neutralization of ino-4800 immune sera using a sars-cov-2 pseudovirus assay fig 4 table 1 and prnt assay against two wild-type sars-cov-2 strains table 1 as well we show that ino-4800 induced antibodies block sars-cov-2 spike binding to the host receptor ace2 using a surrogate neutralization assay fig 6 this study highlights the immunogenicity of ino-4800 and further animal studies will test protection against infection in summary these initial results describing the immunogenicity of covid-19 vaccine candidate ino-4800 are promising and it is particularly encouraging to measure functional antibodies and t cell responses in multiple animal models this study supports the further evaluation of ino-4800 as a vaccine candidate for covid-19 hek-293t atcc crl-3216 and african green

ashwini malla waranyoo phoolcharoen   the global health system consists of a network of organizations including many private and public health sectors operating at different regional or global levels that have developed a stringent system that can provide effective protection to humans against emerging and re-emerging diseases though mortality associated with various infectious diseases have reduced in recent years and global life expectancy has increased in many parts of the world infectious disease threats still remain one of the major global challenges and concerns even now 1 the global health system is often confronted by emerging pathogens responsible for expanding an array of infectious diseases such as zika chikungunya ebola nipah severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and influenza the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has recently added to the list of problematic emerging pathogens in the 21st century which was suspected to originate from the persons exposed to a seafood or wet market in wuhan hubei province china suggesting animal-to-human transmission 23 this virus strain is previously unknown and was reported to infect humans for the first time the virus continues to expand rapidly throughout the world many confirmed and susceptible cases have been identified in wuhan china and exported cases have also been reported in neighboring countries including thailand japan korea taiwan and other countries including the united states canada and european countries which proves that the virus has the potential for quick dissemination across borders in response to the rapid spread of the virus many countries have tightened their border security investigating people showing symptoms and have taken necessary emergency steps to control its spread due to the increasing number of cases in china and other countries the who has declared the 2019-ncov outbreak a global health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 4 coronaviruses covs belongs to the family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae and the order nidovirales they are classified into four genera such as alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus both of which infect mammals whereas gammacoronavirus infect avian species and deltacoronavirus infect both mammalian and avian species it is a large enveloped virus with a positive sense single-stranded rna genome of about 26 to 33 kb that is distributed broadly among birds humans and other mammals such as camels bats mice dogs and cats 5 the genome is surrounded by a helical capsid and an envelope the spike protein forms large protrusions in the envelope in the shape of a crown which gives the virus a coronal appearance the word corona in latin means crown 67 human coronaviruses hcovs are a major group of coronaviruses that are known respiratory pathogens associated with respiratory and intestinal infections of varying severity including the common cold pneumonia and bronchiolitis human coronaviruses such as hcov-229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 usually cause mild infection in humans however the onset of betacoronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov outbreak in guangdong province china in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov disease outbreak in 2012 in the middle east resulted in high pathogenicity in humans which demonstrated the lethality of virus when they cross the species barrier from animals to humans both viruses are believed to be originated from bats and subsequently transmitted to humans 8 hcovs has evolved rapidly in recent years due to mutation high nucleotide substitution rates its ability to establish infection in a new host and cross-species transmission 9 in december 2019 china detected many cases of viral pneumonia-like disease similar to sars that were confirmed to be caused by novel betacoronavirus provisionally called 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov since then the novel coronavirus outbreak has raised attention throughout the world although the potential cause of the disease is still unknown initial reports predicted that the virus is possibly of zoonotic origin 2019-ncov is the causative agent for severe respiratory infection in humans termed as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia ncip 10 ncov is the third known coronavirus that causes fatal respiratory diseases in humans after highly pathogenic viruses sars-cov and mers-cov chinese researchers isolated the novel coronavirus from the infected patient in early 2020 as the virus is closely related to other bat coronaviruses it is suspected that the bats are the primary reservoir for the virus however it is still unclear that if the virus transmitted to humans directly from the bats or whether through an intermediate host detailed understanding of the enzootic patterns of the virus its evolution and surveillance are essential to control the disease and possibly to prevent the future epidemics of similar viruses the explosive outbreak of 2019-ncov in china has been spread rapidly in many countries probably by human movement and travel the geographical distribution of the virus has been increasing since the outbreak in early february 2020 thousands of cases were confirmed in china and more than 300 cases were reported outside of china and numbers of cases are escalating daily in all the provinces in china and other countries the virus has transmitted rapidly and many cases were reported globally as of february 8 2020 nearly 34598 affected cases and 723 fatalities were reported in china most of the confirmed cases were from the wuhan city in hubei province outside china 288 other cases were confirmed globally and one death was reported in philippines in singapore 33 cases were confirmed 32 in thailand 25 in japan 24 in korea 15 each in australia and malaysia 12 in united states and some cases were reported in germany france vietnam uae canada india philippines italy uk russia nepal sri lanka cambodia belgium finland sweden and spain as on early february 11 chinese health authorities who and most of the countries have responded fast and immediate actions were taken to contain the virus all the countries have implemented stringent border control screening travelers for possible infection and travel restrictions in order to prevent its spread the rapid spread of this infection is frightening and also it causes both mortality and financial loss which present the global concern of this emerging disease the transmission of 2019-ncov is often spread from person to person through the respiratory droplets generated during coughs or sneezes from an infected person human-to-human transmission is reported in countries such as germany japan vietnam and the united states 12 the confirmed cases through inter-human transmission have increased the fear and panic accompanying the 2019-ncov outbreak it is still unknown whether the virus spreads only through human contact or if there is possible transmission through oral-fecal contact as well the incubation time varies from 214 days after infection the clinical presentation of this infection resembles sars-cov characterized with fever dry cough and shortness of breath in most of the cases whereas non-respiratory symptoms such as headache muscle ache dyspnoea rhinorrhoea sneezing sore throat diarrhea nausea and vomiting are also reported in few patients the affected persons also develop acute respiratory distress syndrome cases with critical illness showed respiratory failure septic shock and organs failure which require intensive care support 31314 at this time the knowledge about this virus is limited new cases and mortalities are increasing daily as a newly emerging viral infection there is no vaccine or anti-viral therapeutics to treat human coronavirus infection till now as of now preventing infection is the current priority for disease control the current protocol for infected patients is to quarantine and provide supportive management and palliative care the best way to avoid the virus infection is to keep oneself away from infected people and the utmost personal hygienic care is essential quarantine measures shall be taken to separate restrict the movement of infected people and also the normal population from the regions where there is an epidemic outbreak the who recommended precautionary measures to the general public such as frequently cleaning hands wearing a face mask avoiding close contact with the infected persons or farm animals and avoiding consumption of raw or half-cooked meateggs and following good food safety practices 11 there is an urgent need to develop rapid diagnostic tools and vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to treat this infection reliable timely laboratory diagnosis and an effective vaccine are crucial for effective disease management and public health intervention an effective vaccine should be affordable and also the production platform should produce suitable vaccine candidates rapidly at low cost especially during a disease outbreak the advantages and disadvantages of the current expression systems for recombinant protein production are given in table 1 currently plant expression system offers many advantages over other conventional systems that have the potential to tackle the production of vaccine candidates rapidly at affordable cost facilitating the global vaccination programs especially in resource-poor nations where the vaccines are needed most 15 in recent years plants are being focused more on the production of biopharmaceuticals and virus-like particles vlps the technologies employed for the production of plant-made vaccines are stable nuclear expression transient expression and chloroplast expression based on several vital factors like yield quality time and cost appropriate technology can be chosen for producing biopharmaceuticals recent advancements in the plant expression strategies especially the development of transient expression system or viral vectors resulted in a huge increase in the protein yield that makes this plant host system a promising system for the production of various biopharmaceutical proteins 16 several reports in the last two decades have enough evidence to prove that the plant produced biopharmaceuticals are as effective as the mammalian cell-based proteins and also elicit potent neutralizing antibodies or shown therapeutic effects against the particular pathogen or infection 171819 the use of plants for the production of recombinant proteins and biopharmaceuticals has been gaining importance since the plant produced biologic taliglucerase alfa has been commercialized in 2012 against gauchers disease that proclaimed a new era for plant made biopharmaceutical and triggered the innovation in the field of biopharmaceuticals 20 furthermore many plant-produced candidates are in the clinical pipeline close to commercialization some of the examples of plant-produced recombinant antigens and monoclonal antibodies for infectious diseases are given in table 2 currently countries including thailand india japan korea and the european community are majorly involved in developing plant biopharmaceuticals against several human diseases 21 many reports reviewed the importance of plant expression system for the rapid production of candidate vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against infectious diseases 222324252627 many biopharmaceutical companies have shifted their momentum towards the plant expression system by knowing its importance various plants such as tobacco duckweed moss alfalfa and other plants have been used for the production of plant-made pharmaceuticals in september 2015 leaf bio inc the commercial partner of mapp biopharmaceutical inc mapp received fast track designation by the us fda for their plant-made biopharmaceutical called zmapp for the treatment of ebola virus disease the authorization of plant-based biopharmaceutical zmapp for emergency use in the earlier ebv outbreak by fda is potentially a major breakthrough in the plant molecular farming field as it serves as an endorsement of the technology to potential investors and grant funding agencies 505556 many vaccine antigens expressed in plants are in clinical or advanced pre-clinical trials major players in the global plant-based biologics market include plantform ibio inc mapp biopharmaceutical inc pfizer inc ventria bioscience medicago inc greenovation biotech gmbh kentucky bioprocessing phycobiologics inc synthon fraunhofer ime healthgen planet biotechnology and icon genetics gmbh as plant-made biopharmaceuticals provide efficacious and cost-effective strategies to protect against emerging infectious diseases plant expression systems can be employed for the development of vaccines against ncov transient expression in plants can be adapted for biopharmaceutical protein production when it is necessary to produce rapid response vaccines as it produces more protein in a short time the plant-based biopharmaceutical production against 2019-ncov will include the identification of potential epitopes and production of full-length viral surface proteins present in the envelope region or production of subunit vaccines expressing immunogenic region or chimeric proteins the receptor-binding domain rbd in spike protein located on the outer membrane of coronavirus mediates receptor binding and plays a major role in virus entry into the host cell 57 this protein could be used as a potential vaccine candidate as it is the major target for neutralizing antibodies 58 hence it could be considered to develop potential effective vaccines or therapeutics against coronavirus infection as the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the host cell receptor for its cell entry similar like sars-cov 596061 the monoclonal antibodies that are identified and tested to be effective against sars virus protein or specific to ace2 can be produced in plants and shall be tested for its efficacy against ncov earlier reports showed several vaccines and monoclonal antibody candidates in response to sars-cov and mers-cov which could be tested and used for passive immunotherapy for an immediate immune response 626364 the possibility of producing a vlp based vaccine is also feasible by expressing all the structural viral proteins that can assemble into vlps in plants the structural and functional studies of viral proteins in ncov might help in designing better vaccines and specific therapeutics producing viral proteins in plants may further be helpful to evaluate their potential in developing diagnostic kits or the protectiontherapeutic tools that can be manufactured fast in order to manage the highly infectious ncov this will open an avenue to characterize recombinant immunogenic viral proteins and provide a proof of concept for using plants as a robust rapid and flexible platform for producing proteinresearch reagents which are highly essential to face potential ncov outbreaks the coronavirus outbreak has been declared a global health emergency and represents one of the greatest risks to global health as the virus has a tendency to infect a large number of human populations and the outbreak can cause severe medical complications with economic impact particularly in middle-income countries where resources are limited for early diagnosis and preventive measures human mobility air travel and international trade can likely increase the number of cases in other regions as well continued surveillance along with the robust response of government agencies medical practitioners and researchers is highly essential for the effective management of this emerging pathogen public health officials need to identify the source and virus reservoir transmission cycle pathogenesis inter-human transmission and clinical manifestations which might be helpful to develop animal models diagnostic reagents anti-viral therapies and vaccines against this pathogen as the virus emerged suddenly and became a serious global concern there is a need for rapid vaccine development although classical expression systems for biopharmaceutical proteins are still amenable the development of transient expression in plants has deeply influenced the pharmaceutical sector to produce affordable vaccines and biologics rapidly at low cost hence the plant expression platform shall be employed for biopharmaceutical production to accelerate the fight against this deadly infectious disease the collaborative efforts of researchers are highly desirable to use a plant expression platform for producing an efficient cost-effective vaccine to control this epidemic the continuous effort of research in this direction might be helpful in producing high-value biologics and pharmaceuticals on a large scale in a short time especially during epidemics  current advancements and potential strategies in the development of mers-cov vaccines naru zhang shibo jiang lanying du   as proposed by the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses ictv three groups 1 2 and 3 of the coronaviridae family have been commonly accepted as -cov -cov and -cov respectively where the genus -cov consists of four lineages namely a b c and d 13 a novel genus -cov including hku11 hku12 and hku13 identified in birds in 2005 was added in the cov genera 13 unlike any other previously identified covs such as -cov nl63 which was first reported in 2004 14 as well as -cov hku1 which was first discovered in hong kong in 2005 1516 and sars-cov which caused a worldwide outbreak in 2003 17 mers-cov belongs to lineage c of -cov and is the first known lineage c -cov associated with human infections 18 phylogenetically mers-cov is closely related to bat covs hku4 and hku5 1921 mers-cov is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus its genome is about 30 kilobase kb pairs in length consisting of 11 functional open reading frames orfs figure 2 
table 1 the viral genome encodes five unique proteins known as accessory proteins 3 4a 4b 5 8b which serve different functions with no known homologs to any other cov proteins accessory protein 4a for example was recently proven to block the production of host interferon ifn 22 although these accessory proteins are not essential for virus replication recent studies by reverse genetics demonstrated that the absence of the genes encoding these proteins as a group may attenuate viral titers 23 additionally the genome of mers-cov encodes six proteins which are homologous to those of the known covs including two replicase proteins orfs 1a and 1b and four major structural proteins such as spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins figure 2
11 the e protein is a transmembrane protein forming an ion channel on the viral surface the cov n protein plays an important role in encapsidating the genomic rna and interacting with the m protein and other n molecules 24 the s protein of covs is a type i transmembrane glycoprotein displayed as an oligomer on the surface of the viral membrane the precursor s protein contains a cleavage site at which the protein could be cleaved into two non-covalently associated subunits the distal subunit s1 and the membrane-anchored subunit s2 25 the s1 subunit contains the cellular receptor-binding domain rbd 26 while the s2 subunit contains a putative fusion peptide transmembrane domain and two heptad repeat regions the heptad repeat 1 and 2 hr1 and hr2 figure 3
27 figure 3a lists the representative structures of s proteins of - and -cov nl63-cov mouse hepatitis cov mhv-cov and sars-cov 2830 with the rbds of these cov s proteins consisting of respective core and receptor-binding subdomains for example the receptor-binding motif of sars-cov contains residues from 424 to 494 which form a long extended loop with two short antiparallel -sheets and one disulfide bond between c467 and c474 31 similar to the s proteins of other covs the s protein of mers-cov also contains s1 and s2 subunits with s1 being responsible for receptor binding and s2 for membrane fusion 32 unlike covs sars-cov and nl63-cov which use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as their receptors 3334 mers-cov utilizes human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 as its cellular receptor dpp4 is expressed on primary bronchiolar epithelial cells and regulates the activity of hormones and chemokines through proteolytic cleavage 1235 recent studies have solved the crystal structures of mers-cov s protein alone or complexed with its receptor dpp4 and mapped the rbd of mers-cov to the residues covering 367588 or 367606 respectively 323637 according to the crystal structures the rbd of mers-cov also contains the core and receptor-binding subdomains with the receptor-binding motif consisting of 84 amino acids from v484 to l567 that form a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet figure 3b
3236 similar to other covs the hr1 and hr2 of mers-cov form a 6-helix bundle believed to drive virion-cell membrane fusion with three hr1 helices forming the central coiled-coil core and three hr2 chains surrounding the core in the hr1 side grooves 233839 figure 4 describes the crystal structures of sars-cov and mers-cov rbd complexed with their respective receptors and the major neutralizing epitopes on sars-cov rbd for the neutralizing monoclonal antibody against sars-cov 364042 understanding of these neutralizing epitopes in rbd of sars-cov will provide useful guidance for the identification of the neutralizing epitopes in mers-cov rbd and hence designing rbd-based neutralizing epitope-dependent vaccines against mers-cov previous reviews on sars have summarized the approaches for the development of effective cov vaccines pointed out the importance of sars-cov s protein as a target for vaccine and therapeutic development and outlined a roadmap for the product development of a sars-cov rbd protein-based subunit vaccine with manufacturing for future clinical testing 4346 in this review we will briefly discuss current stages of mers vaccine development and provide potential strategies for developing mers vaccines based on the experience from development of sars vaccines with the focus on subunit vaccines and how to improve the efficacy of mers subunit vaccines in addition we also summarize current animal models for mers-cov and emphasize the importance for evaluation of efficacy of mers vaccine candidates in effective animal models no currently licensed mers vaccines are available for use however researchers are working to develop potential vaccines and recent successes in the engineering of a replication-competent propagation-defective mers-cov using reverse genetics provide the possibility of developing attenuated viruses as mers vaccine candidates 47 sars studies have demonstrated that vaccines inducing strong neutralizing antibodies completely protected immunized subjects against sars-cov infection moreover recovered patients infected with sars-cov could maintain potent and persistent rbd-specific antibody responses with neutralizing activity 48 revealing the significance of neutralizing antibodies in the prevention of sars like the case of sars-cov vaccines although vaccines eliciting favorable cellular immune responses may play a role in the clearance of virus infection vaccines inducing neutralizing antibodies will be sufficient for protection from mers-cov infection thus the ability of eliciting neutralizing antibodies is expected to be one of the important criteria for evaluating the efficacy of mers vaccines previous studies of sars-cov have shown that the s protein particularly the rbd may induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies that protected vaccinated animals against sars-cov challenge 434951 it is thus expected that the s protein in mers-cov will also be important for the development of vaccines song et al showed that vaccination with a recombinant-modified vaccinia virus ankara mva expressing the full-length s protein of mers-cov induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated mice 52 however cao and colleagues have reported that although the mva-based full-length s protein-dependent sars vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses in ferrets it failed to protect the vaccinated animals from sars-cov challenge even worse this vaccine was associated with enhanced inflammatory and immunopathological effects resulting in serious liver damage in the vaccinated ferrets after viral challenge 53 therefore caution should be taken when the full-length s protein of mers-cov is used as a vaccine antigen since the non-neutralizing epitopes in s protein may induce antibody-mediated disease enhancement ade effects as those elicited by the s protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv also a cov 54 therefore it is favorable to develop vaccines based on s protein fragments particularly rbd of mers-cov and such strategy has been reported to be effective in the development of mers vaccines studies have shown that neutralization against mers-cov infection could be elicited in vaccinated rabbits by a fragment containing residues 358588 of mers-cov s protein 55 the induction of neutralizing activity by a recombinant protein fragment containing residues 377662 of mers-cov rbd has also been demonstrated particularly a truncated 212-amino acid rbd fragment containing residues 377588 inside rbd residues 367606 of mers-cov s protein induced strong mers-cov s-specific antibodies in vaccinated mice blocking the binding of mers-cov rbd to viral receptor dpp4 and effectively neutralizing mers-cov infection thus providing promise for further development as an effective and safe mers vaccine 5657 in addition to the s protein other mers-cov viral proteins might play a role in the development of mers candidate vaccines however few studies have addressed this possibility in particular because mers has only recently emerged as a novel human disease and vaccine development is a time-consuming process a recent study reveals that structural and accessory proteins such as m orf 4a orf 4b and orf 5 of mers-cov may function as potent ifn antagonists 58 with orf 4a protein showing the greatest potential for counteracting the antiviral effects of ifn by inhibiting ifn production and ifn-sensitive response element signaling pathways therefore these proteins may also serve as targets for developing mers vaccines the inactivated and live-attenuated sars-cov has been tested as vaccine candidates some of which are proven to be effective to provide protective immunity against sars-cov infection 5961 it was previously reported that a -propiolactone-inactivated sars-cov vaccine administered subcutaneously sc to mice was more effective in inhibiting virus replication in the murine respiratory tract than the adenovirus-based n and s vaccine given either intranasally in or intramuscularly im 62 in addition a live impaired-fidelity sars-cov vaccine with engineered inactivation of exonuclease activity protects aged and immunocompromised mice against lethal virus challenge 63 apparently both local and serum antibody responses can be induced in inactivated sars-cov vaccinated mice 64 like sars-cov it might be possible to attenuate mers-cov by deleting the envelope e protein to diminish virus growth in tissue culture while abrogating virulence in animals 6566 or by inactivating exonuclease activity in spite of the possibility of inducing highly potent immune responses and protection vaccine candidates based on the inactivated and live-attenuated mers-cov might have the potential of recovering virulence raising safety concerns as such this vaccine type may be inappropriate for use by highly immunosuppressed individuals dna vaccines consist of a plasmid dna which has been genetically engineered to produce immunological response to protect organisms against diseases dna is usually administered through two routes im delivery and bombardment of the skin using a gene gun 67 currently two popular theories of dna uptake are used including non-specific phagocytosis or pinocytosis and antigen-specific receptor-mediated uptake 6869 containing non-replicating and non-infectious components and only encoding the protein of interest dna vaccines are safe for use minimizing undesirable side effects 67 in addition vaccines based on dnas are easy to be scaled up by the fermentation technique 7072 and are generally stable and inexpensive the efficacy of dna-based vaccines against sars-cov infection has been widely reviewed it is revealed that a dna vaccine encoding sars-cov s protein induces neutralizing antibody as well as t-cell responses that protect vaccinated mice from sars-cov challenge 73 in addition igg antibody and t-cell-mediated immune responses are induced by dna vaccines encoding s1 of sars-cov 74 interestingly expression of m protein of sars-cov can augment immune responses induced by np protein of a sars-cov dna vaccine 75 nevertheless compared with other vaccine types such as inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines dna-based vaccines usually have lower immunogenicity 76 indicating the need to further improve their immune efficacy although it is possible to use similar strategies to develop dna-based vaccines against mers-cov infection suitable measures such as priming-boost strategy or combination of dna vaccines with other vaccination types should be considered to improve the immunogenicity of dna-based mers vaccines 77 viral vectors have been applied as an important delivery vehicle for developing candidate vaccines against sars-cov infection currently reported viral vectors for sars vaccines include mva vesicular stomatitis virus rhabdovirus adenovirus adeno-associated virus and attenuated parainfluenza virus 7880 previous reports have indicated the ability of an mva-based vaccine expressing sars-cov s protein in the induction of neutralizing antibody with protection of vaccinated mice against sars-cov challenge 78 in addition a combination of adenoviral-based sars vaccines encoding s1 m and np protein respectively induced strong neutralizing antibodies and t-cell immune responses protecting immunized monkeys from challenge of sars-cov 80 the induction of sufficient cellular and humoral immune responses has also been demonstrated with neutralizing activity by an adeno-associated virus-based vaccine containing rbd of sars-cov in the protection of sars-cov challenge 8182 the above approaches for developing viral vector-based sars vaccines can be adopted for the development of mers vaccines indeed mers-cov s protein delivered by an mva vector induces in the vaccinated mice antibody responses with neutralizing activity 52 bringing some hopes for the development of viral vector-based vaccines to prevent mers-cov infection however it should be noted that viral vector-based vaccines do have some disadvantages for example some vectors such as mva or adenovirus have pre-existing immunity or cause harmful immune responses 8384 and inflammation 85 thus caution should be taken when developing mers vaccines using viral vectors vlp-based vaccines have been developed as a new generation of non-egg-based cell culture-derived vaccine candidates against virus infection and thus have gained much more attention for their potential promise in developing effective and safe vaccines against sars-cov 86 vlps can be produced in several expression systems such as mammalian cells eg 293t cho yeast recombinant vaccinia virus and baculovirus expression systems 8788 it is worth noting that the minimal components essential for vlp formation and the immunogenicity induced by vlps need to be considered although m and e proteins of sars-cov are sufficient for the efficient formation of vlps 89 the immunogenicity induced by vlps without s protein might be greatly reduced by comparison chimeric vlps carrying sars-cov s protein and e m and n proteins of mhv-cov elicited high levels of sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies protecting vaccinated mice from sars-cov challenge 88 the above findings on sars-cov vlps may be applied to constructing vlps for mers-cov compared with inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines vlps do not contain the infectious materials making vlp technology a promising alternative for mers vaccine development however the immunogenicity of vlps is relatively lower than that of inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines several strategies may be explored to increase the immunogenicity of vlps for example dendritic cell-stimulating molecules or toll-like receptor 5 ligand flagellin can be genetically engineered for incorporation into mers-cov vlps to increase immunogenicity and enhance protective efficacy against further heterosubtypic virus challenge 9091 compared with other types of vaccines subunit vaccines can claim several unique advantages the most important characteristic of subunit vaccines is their safety in that the components only contain synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins expressing specific immunogenic fragments of a pathogen without the involvement of infectious viruses additionally this type of vaccine is less likely to induce side effects at the injection sites and consistent production can be attained for subunit vaccines because of constant conditions and well-defined pathogenic fragments the above features have made subunit vaccines an attractive vaccine candidate like sars-cov s protein the s protein of mers-cov is also considered an important target for development of subunit vaccines because it is the main antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune responses since the s protein contains regions for receptor binding and membrane fusion s protein-based vaccines are expected to induce antibodies to block virus binding and subsequent membrane fusion or neutralize viral infection 43 however the s protein of sars-cov also contains some non-neutralizing epitopes in the immmunopredominant domain 92 which may induce harmful immune responses 85 therefore it is essential to identify and exclude the epitopes in the s protein that may induce harmful or ade responses from the s protein-based mers-cov vaccines experience from developing rbd-based sars subunit vaccines provides important guidance on the rational design of rbd protein-based mers vaccines since the rbd of sars-cov contains multiple neutralizing epitopes rbd-based sars subunit vaccines covering these neutralizing epitopes are able to induce potent neutralizing antibodies completely preventing sars-cov challenge 5051 similarly it has been shown that the rbd of mers-cov induced strong neutralizing antibody responses against infection of mers-cov 5657 and that the mers-cov rbd does indeed contain several important neutralizing epitopes 93 accordingly further optimization of the rbd and development of optimized rbd-based mers subunit vaccines containing multiple neutralizing epitopes would be desirable and feasible to improve the vaccine efficacy both mers-cov and sars-cov rbds consist of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain they share a high degree of structural similarity in the core subdomains but the receptor-binding subdomains are notably divergent 32 because of variation of the receptor-binding subdomain region within subgroups of the same cov or across different cov groups it is advisable to rationally design mers subunit vaccines using chimeric s protein containing several neutralizing epitopes from divergent subgroups this approach will provide a strategic platform for the rational design of subunit vaccines against future emerging covs by focusing on the chimeric s protein containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple virus strains across different subgroups 94 to summarize although the inactivated and live-attenuated virus and viral vector-based vaccines are able to induce strong immune responses their tendency to recover virulence or cause harmful immune responses raises safety concerns for the development of mers vaccines while dna-based vaccines have a high safety profile they may be unable to induce highly potent immune response and protection in humans and might cause toxic effect at the injection sites with the repeated vaccinations by comparison development of recombinant rbd protein-based mers subunit vaccines remains a high priority due to a variety of advantages noted above to improve the immunogenicity of mers candidate vaccines adjuvants should be selected and formulated on the basis of their mechanisms of action normally vaccines with limited immunogenicity require the addition of specific adjuvants to stimulate a protective and long-lasting immune response 9698 although a variety of novel adjuvants are now emerging and being investigated only a few have been approved for clinical use both aluminum salt-based adjuvants usually called alum and mf59tm can induce antigen-specific humoral and ctl responses 99100 hence they have the potential for use in mers-cov subunit vaccines another adjuvant named glucopyranosyl lipid a a synthetic tlr4 agonist was also shown to improve the immunogenicity of a protein-based vaccine candidate 101 other adjuvants such as montanide isa51 which has been approved for human use in europe 102103 is used in making mers and influenza subunit vaccines demonstrating a strong ability to promote the induction of highly potent immune responses of these candidate vaccines 5657104 furthermore the combination of two adjuvants with distinct mechanisms of action is also feasible to improve the efficacy of designed mers subunit vaccines since alum alone cannot induce strong th1 immune responses it is thus applicable to combine alum with other adjuvants with potential complementary effects in a hope to improve the efficacy induced by alum-adjuvanted subunit vaccines for example combination of alum plus glucopyranosyl lipid a will be applied to improve the efficacy of a sars-cov rbd protein-based subunit vaccine 45 therefore similar strategies can be utilized in mers-cov subunit vaccines to improve their immunogenicity several administration routes including im intradermal sc and in pathways have been used for vaccine immunization in both experimental research and clinical use the route of vaccine administration directly influences both the quality and quantity of vaccine-induced immunity 105108 traditional parenteral administration routes such as im intradermal and sc have been shown to induce favorable immune responses andor protection against sars-cov and mers-cov infections 57109111 it is demonstrated that im vaccination with rbd protein of sars-cov elicits long-term immune responses with neutralizing activity protecting immunized mice from sars-cov challenge 50 additionally potent neutralizing antibodies and protection against sars-cov infection are observed in the mice sc vaccinated with sars-cov rbd proteins respectively expressed in mammalian cell insect cell and escherichia coli expression systems 49112 furthermore strong neutralizing antibody responses are revealed in the mice sc-vaccinated mers-cov rbd proteins 56 in addition to inducing systemic immunity the stimulation of local immunity at mucosal sites has become an important objective for vaccination although there are some unfavorable features from the in route such as the possibility of delivering antigens into the central nervous system 113 as well as the unsuitability for children younger than 2 years and adults older than 50 years especially those with chronic pulmonary diseases and immunosuppression 114 the advantages of the in route outweigh its disadvantages reports have indicated that in vaccination effectively induced both local and systemic immune responses especially mucosal iga against mucosal pathogens cross-protecting vaccinated animals from infection by homologous and heterologous strains of influenza virus 115 as well as providing long-term protection against sars-cov infection 81 as an important mucosal pathogen infecting humans via the mucosal pathway 9 mers vaccines delivered via the mucosal route are anticipated to elicit effective mucosal immune responses as represented by mucosal iga intranasal immunization of a subunit candidate vaccine containing recombinant rbd protein fused with fc of human igg has been demonstrated to induce strong anti-rbd- and anti-s1-specific neutralizing antibody responses particularly iga mucosal immune responses against infections from mers-cov 93 providing a fundamental basis for developing effective mers mucosal vaccines therefore selection of suitable vaccination routes combined with antigen formulation with appropriate adjuvants will play important guidance for developing mers-cov subunit vaccines and further evaluating their efficacy against mers-cov infection establishment of effective animal models is important for evaluating the efficacy of candidate vaccines against mers-cov unlike sars-cov which can infect a variety of animals including non-human primates and small animal models such as ferrets hamsters and mice 7678116118 the animal species that could be infected by mers-cov are very limited it has been shown that mers-cov is unable to replicate in hamsters ferrets and mice 119122 significantly restricting the efficacy evaluation of mers vaccines in small animal models although rhesus macaques can be infected by mers-cov with the infected animals showing clinical signs of disease and virus replication 123124 the high cost of non-human primate models would prevent the majority of researchers from using this animal model therefore the development of effective small animal models for mers-cov infection is urgently needed 125 it was recently reported that mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing mers-covs receptor dpp4 were susceptible to mers-cov infection with the infected mice developing pneumonia and clinical disease accompanied by histopathological changes 126 nevertheless a better transgenic mouse model with the gene encoding human dpp4 integrated into its genome has been developed by several laboratories 127 based on the previous experience in developing sars-cov vaccines current advancements and potential strategies in the development of mers-cov vaccines have been discussed in this review apart from inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines dna- and vlp-based vaccines particularly subunit vaccines containing the rbd of mers-cov s protein are critically important additionally suitable adjuvant formulation and appropriate administration routes may need to be further considered to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidates furthermore development of effective animal models for mers-cov infection is important for evaluating the efficacy of mers-cov candidate vaccines taken together the strategies discussed above will have important implications for the development of effective mers vaccines in the future mers-cov as a newly emerging cov has raised worldwide concerns based on its ability to cause increasing number of human infections with limited human-to-human transmission making it particularly important to explore efficient and safe measures for the control of the disease among these vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent virus infection different from other structural proteins e m and n s protein of mers-cov plays a key role in virus infection via s1 binding to viral receptor followed by subsequent virus and cell membrane fusion via s2 dpp4 was identified to be the cellular receptor of mers-cov subsequently the viral rbd was mapped by crystal structural analysis into residues 367588 and 367606 in the s1 subunit of s protein the truncated rbd containing residues 377588 induced the highest neutralizing antibody response against virus infection in vaccinated animals and thus demonstrating the importance for developing s-rbd-based vaccines against mers-cov compared with other vaccine types subunit vaccines possess a higher safety profile having the potential to elicit stronger immune responses including neutralizing antibodies suitable choices in adjuvant formulation and immunization routes can further increase the efficacy of such subunit vaccines highlighting the need to develop mers-cov subunit vaccines based on the rbd of viral s protein in the next 5 years the development of an effective and safe subunit vaccine against mers can be expected in particular the development of a subunit vaccine based on the rbd of mers-cov s protein has the greatest potential to contain multiple neutralizing epitopes capable of inducing highly potent immune responses particularly neutralizing activity against mers-cov infection the establishment of effective small animal models for mers infection will allow economical and practical detection of protective efficacy of designed vaccines against challenges from both single and multiple mers-cov strains potentially occurring in humans the application of similar vaccine development strategies against other covs that might cause human diseases in the future is also anticipated  towards effective covid-19 vaccines updates perspectives and challenges

aristidis tsatsakis   in december 2019 the first patient with an atypical form of pneumonia was diagnosed in china a disease that would later be referred to as covid-19 by the world health organization who one month later in january 2020 the causative agent of the covid-19 disease the sars-cov-2 virus was deciphered and identified and its genome was published rapidly 1 by mid-april 2020 the extent of impact of covid-19 on the global population was becoming evident the most adversely affected region per capita was western europe the most seriously affected population being the elderly especially those with extensive co-morbidities and weakened immune systems the causes for regional differences in covid-19 will require months of analysis if not years to ascertain more focused approaches to reduce the impacts of covid-19 in the near-term especially on the most vulnerable populations need to be pursued in parallel with longer-term approaches to lessen the impact of covid-19 or other coronavirus-driven diseases across all demographics as of mid-april the very short-term measures that have been implemented to reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 are the same as those that were taken to reduce the transmission of sars-cov during the 2002-2003 sars pandemic good hygiene and quarantine with the latter being far more severe and extensive than the quarantine implemented in 2002-2003 other short-term measures that have been implemented on a very sporadic basis are what can be termed tactical treatments these tactical treatments do not strengthen the immune system but rather have the goal of containing the adverse impacts of the viral attack some examples of tactical treatments that have been tested are eidd-2801 remdesivir favipiravir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine combination of lopinavir and ritonavir tocilizumab losartan to name a few tests so far have yielded very mixed results a second avenue being pursued to amelioratereduce the effects of covid-19 is development of vaccines to induce viral immunity the bulk of the present review addresses the status and prospects of this vaccine approach the third leg of this triad of approaches to ameliorate the ravaging effects especially for the most vulnerable of covid-19 is what can be called the strategic treatment approach 2 this approach has the goal of strengthening the immune system to allow its adaptive component to neutralize the incoming coronavirus without the need for external support strategic treatments eliminate tangible factors that contribute to weaken the immune system some examples of such factors based on existing studies include titanium dioxide air pollution chlorpyrifos aluminum sulfate prenatal alcohol exposure zno oil fly ash and many others 3-9 also the real life exposure scenario in which we are exposed continuously to combination of stressors influences in the long term the immune system and the response of the organism to the viral stressors 10-14 tsatsakis et al 15 have shown how pollutants can influence the immune system particularly by modulating ahr pathway and how these effects can be prevented by more strict regulations while some positive impact may result in the short-term from strategic treatments their main impact will probably be for the long-term except for those whose immune systems have suffered irreversible damage or those who have an overwhelming genetic predisposition to immune dysfunction because strategic treatments appropriate to any specific individual are difficult to identify and difficult to eliminate because of ingrained habits some emphasis needs to be placed on those types of treatments that do not require severe lifestyle alterations this work aims to analyze the strategies and challenges regarding the development of effective vaccines against sars-cov-2 the discovery of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus is an important component of the three-pronged approach described initially given that the pandemic cannot seem to be entirely stopped by social distancing and good hygiene practices the tactical therapies identified so far have not been entirely effective especially for the most vulnerable individuals being unable to prevent severe disability and ultimately death while healthcare systems are still struggling not to crumble under pressure from coronavirus patients research laboratories around the world are competing to produce an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 as soon as possible in order to be able to stop the spread of the new coronavirus global immune deficiency is a risk factor for anti-covid-19 vaccine efficacy particularly in elderly who have been exposed to a myriad of factors that contribute to weakening of the immune system as described previously these factors also result in diseases such as obesityobesity-related eg type ii diabetes metabolic syndrome and immune-mediated cancers mechanistic reasons for these diseases include weakness of antigen recognition decreased immune cell quantity and functionality increased levellength and timing of humoral immune alterations of components reduced initiation of cellular responses and memory cell disorders other associations with immunodeficiency include age-dependent humoral and immune cell alterations immunosenescence malnutrition 19 protein-energy-micronutrient deficit and telomere shortening 20 in addition past or current treatments affect the scalable ineffectiveness of vaccines in both older adults 21 and children 22 especially in immunocompromised 23 exposure to immunosuppressive drugs 24 or residence in developing countries 25 with a low socioeconomic status is associated with a higher viral mortality compared to residence in developed countries 26 current global obesity prevalence in adult and children is also a risk factor for anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine inefficacy due to higher levels of il-6 27 and decreased igg concentrations parasitic infections respiratory tract infections such as complicated pneumonia 28 can also affect subsequent immune response to anti-sars-cov-2 vaccination 29 adjuvant purity and safety knowledge gaps of the relative contribution of the innate and adaptive responses to protection against individual pathogens and the precise mode of action of individual adjuvants 30 are existing negative factors in vaccine efficacy anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be available by vaccine market players according to current orphan drug 31 and vaccine legislation 3233 due to the fight against sars-cov-2 pandemic this means that design defect failure to warn and negligence in testing may also affect vaccine efficacy under those conditions long-term safety testing of vaccines in humans will be non-existent there is no data on whether anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be first licensed in developed countries 34 or if all vaccine production facilities will be adequate to assure a reliable supply of new anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines 35 in a timely manner and are compatible with specifications and improved adult vaccine design strategy by who or immunobiography 36 and heterogeneity of immune responses in the elderly subpopulations 36 the safety of the vaccine is initially assessed in laboratory studies with mice or rabbits if the animals do not show signs of disease after receiving the vaccine then the tests begin in humans and the number of subjects gradually increases 37 duration of the clinical trial on average for a classical vaccine after preclinical stage - in vitro and in vivo tests is as follows 3839 in phase i also called the first human test the vaccine is given to a small group of healthy volunteers 10 to 100 the purpose is not to test whether the vaccine protects against the disease but whether it is safe or whether it causes severe side effects in phase ii the candidate vaccine is administered to a larger group of subjects 100-1000 and in phase iii to an even larger group 1000-100000 separate studies may be required in adults children and the elderly it sometimes happens that vaccines that seem safe when given to a small number of people show side effects when given to a larger number of people this is explained by the fact that any rare complication is less likely to occur when the group of subjects is small continuous monitoring is important in case of complications that occur with delayed effect 40 during a pandemic these sequential studies may be shortened and partially overlapped but it is important that thousands of vaccinated people are followed for several months before the general purpose vaccine is approved if there are more severe signs of inflammation or if the vaccine causes the immune system to malfunction in other ways the candidate vaccine may not be suitable for widespread use when such adverse effects are identified delays in the production process inevitably occur 41 at present only two potential vaccines against the sars-cov-2 virus are in the first phase and this by a derogation from the rule - skipped animal studies fig 1 the first vaccine that does not follow all research steps is called mrna-1273 and will be tested in the first phase in seattle there is an explanation for the speed of approval which is related to the fact that the coronavirus is not used in the vaccine development it is an experimental vaccine made by a new method based on rna basically the rna molecule in the vaccine teaches the cells to produce the disease-specific antigen and trains the body for the real enemy but there is also a small problem to date no vaccine based mrna technology has been approved for any disease although a few have reached the second phase of testing 42 the second vaccine is ad5-ncov the vaccine is created by genetic engineering and tries to teach the body to recognize the coronavirus protein s which is delivered via a type-5 adenovirus adenoviruses are a family of about one hundred double-stranded dna viruses that cause various diseases in humans and animals and type-5 is often used for genetic recombination although clinical trials have begun for these two candidates and are likely to begin soon for other potential vaccines it is unlikely to move to phase ii earlier than a few months vaccines stimulate immunity to the virus but can also stimulate inflammation in the body this can manifest itself either as pain or inflammation at the site where the subject was injected or as general symptoms such as fever or fatigue symptoms similar to covid-19 disease for most vaccines these reactions are mild and affect only a small proportion of subjects when a vaccine causes the production of antibodies in mice or in humans this does not necessarily mean that the vaccine will protect against the disease ideally before moving on to human studies researchers should be able to demonstrate that the vaccine will protect laboratory animals from the disease when they are experimentally infected with the virus in the case of diseases caused by previous coronaviruses sars and mers it was difficult to find an animal species that would be affected by the disease in the same way as humans are affected however previous research may help scientists speed up the animal testing process for covid-19 the protective effect of a human vaccine is assessed using a series of studies similar to the series of safety studies if the vaccine elicits an immune system response for example if antibodies can be detected in the phase i study then larger phase ii and phase iii studies can be performed to see if the vaccine protects against infection or disease although covid-19 is a new disease research on sars and mers has helped us understand how the human body responds to coronaviruses and how the response of the immune system generates protection against disease 43 restricted human studies can also be used to calculate the correct dose and schedule for the vaccine some vaccines generate a strong immune response after a single dose but others require a booster dose after a month or longer this strategy also increases the duration of studies to assess whether a vaccine prevents covid-19 among those exposed to the infection it should be tested in phase iii studies in a setting where the infection is actively occurring in response to the west african ebola outbreak in 201415 the rvsv ebola vaccine went through all three phases of clinical development in just 12 months through the centralized coordination of who mdecins sans frontires and manufacturer during this period there were still cases of ebola in guinea and the protection of the vaccine was demonstrated by vaccinating the contacts of the residual cases as they appeared in the community 44 in the case of pandemic vaccines tens or hundreds of millions of doses are needed this production process takes at least six months if the production lines already exist any new vaccine involves a new production process which involves several quality control steps the manufacturer must ensure that each vaccine produced is of consistent quality and requires repeated testing moreover because vaccine manufacturing is a biological process inevitably some batches of vaccines will fail for reasons that are not always clear which can further delay production there are quite a few manufacturers in the world that can produce vaccines on a large enough scale to meet the needs of a pandemic before initiating each stage of the human testing process the developer must provide evidence that the vaccine has early indications of protection and is safe among those who have been tested research ethics committees review clinical trial plans and authorities such as the european medicines agency ema and food and drug administration fda oversee the entire vaccine development process before approving it for general use these assessments usually take several weeks or months 45 although such approvals could be shortened in the event of a pandemic many potential covid-19 vaccines use new technologies so regulators will not be able to rely on the experience of similar vaccines to speed up the process developers of the covid-19 vaccine were given a target to produce a vaccine in 12-18 months while historically vaccines took 15-20 years to develop there are diseases against which vaccines do not yet exist despite decades of work for example more than 100000 children die each year from respiratory diseases caused by another rna virus rsv respiratory syncytial virus which causes pneumonia despite 50 years of research and 18 products developed there is currently no rsv vaccine available 46 numerous scientific research groups are working on the development of a covid-19 vaccine using a number of different approaches having many groups in the race is important as most vaccines entering clinical trials will fail for safety or efficacy reasons sars-cov-2 is part of the coronavirus family as is sars-cov-1 which generated the 2003 sars epidemic and mers-cov which generated the mers epidemic in 2013 47 the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes a respiratory infection called covid-19 coronavirus infectious disease - 2019 with an average incubation period of 5 days between 2 and 14 days 48 the disease is characterized by predominant respiratory symptoms cough difficulty breathing fever of moderate intensity in about 80 of cases but may have severe manifestations bilateral interstitial pneumonia with progression to respiratory failure acute respiratory distress ards the main cause of mortality there are also cases with gastrointestinal manifestations especially diarrhea and in some patients especially in the young ones hypoanosmia loss of sense of smell and hypodysgeusia alteration of the sense of taste have been reported as early symptoms 49 shortly after the publication of the genetic structure of sars-cov-2 the first two vaccines were developed sars-cov-2 virus structure is composed of an rna molecule surrounded by a series of structural and functional proteins 50 known structural proteins are protein s or spike - which leads to the characteristic appearance protein m membrane protein e envelopes protein n nucleocapsid of these protein s has the role of attaching to receptors in human cells and facilitating the fusion of viral content with the cell in the case of sars-cov-2 the receptor is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is found in large quantities in the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma 51-54 the initial infection of sars-cov-2 occurs in the ciliary epithelial cells of the bronchi 5556 the binding of protein s to ace2 is greatly favored by the existence of the polybase cleavage site - a protein fragment cleaved by the furin enzyme commonly found in the human body allowing protein s fragments s1 s2 and s3 to perform their function in addition to fusing the viral envelope with the cell membrane the virus also infects the human cell through endocytosis the cell membrane around the portion that binds to the virus forms a vesicle inside the cell detaches from the membrane and introduces the virus into the cell via that vesicle through the process of entering the cell the virus loses its envelope which fuses with the cell membrane and the viral rna is free in the cytoplasm carrying out two processes replication and transcription first the cellular components responsible for rna transcription produce viral proteins and the rna is copied subsequently these proteins and copies of the initial rna are packed into new virions released from the cell to spread the infection 57 humoral immunity consists of the production of specific antibodies against these antigens these are i antibodies that appear rapidly during infection and disappear rapidly igm and ii antibodies that appear slower and persist in the body for a long time even after the infection is cured igg 58 cellular immunity requires training certain immune cells to recognize and destroy the virus it has been observed in sars-cov-2 infection that the number of cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes is low in the peripheral blood because they are destroyed in the process of elimination of the virus but has high concentrations of activation markers 59 regarding the sars-cov virus memory cells capable of recognizing it have been identified in the blood of healed patients several years after the infection the persistence of memory cells is an important element to consider in the development of the anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine 60 cases have been described where the sars-cov-2 infection recurs after being considered cured 61 on the other hand there is evidence that coronaviruses are equipped with mechanisms by which they can sometimes evade immune attack first after infection of the cell the vesicles in which the virus is located are lacking in the receptors that could recognize the virus as an invader of the body second interferon synthesis with antiviral function is inhibited by coronaviruses and the presentation of viral antigens by pca is low in infected patients 62 current pandemic of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 is a global epidemiological problem the solution of which will require establishment of large-scale production of the vaccine given the experience of previous coronavirus outbreaks showing a high variability of the virus it is required to develop a vaccine production platform providing the scalability technological flexibility and versatility these vaccines must provide high efficacy safety and tolerability this is due to the time required to prove that the proposed vaccine is safe and effective as well as the time required to produce millions of doses many candidate vaccines which initially look promising are likely to fail during the testing process the process of developing a new vaccine begins with a so-called candidate vaccine which a team of scientists believes to have potential this is the fastest part of the process and takes up to a few weeks thus some candidate vaccines are being developed in russia against covid-19 the shemyakin and ovchinnikov institute of bioorganic chemistry is developing liposome-encapsulated dna-protein vaccine based on the covid-19 spike antigens and its dna coding sequence and vlp vaccine based on hsb antigen fused with covid-19 spike antigens the vaccine candidates against covid-19 based on live attenuated recombinant influenza vector platform are developed by fsbsi chumakov federal scientific center for research and development of immune- and biological products of russian academy of sciences and smorodintsev research institute of influenza who national influenza centre the fsbsi chumakov federal scientific center for research and development of immune- and biological products of russian academy of sciences is developing two vaccines based on an attenuated and an inactivated strain of the covid-19 virus isolated in centre chumakov personal communication of professor egorov for efficient application of sars-cov-2 vaccines not only the production procedure needs to be developed but also requires a large-scale production followed by vaccination program targeting muti-million population of different regions only such a complex approach will allow combatting of the coronavirus disease pandemic new technologies do not require the work with live virus making their production much easier but still needing further scientific and technological evidence fig 2 the mrna encoding ribonucleic acid vaccine encodes a stable prefused form the form before being fused to the cell membrane of the host cell of spike protein s 63 protein complex s is required for membrane fusion and host cell infection and has been the target of vaccines against mers and sars membrane fusion viral and cellular is an essential step when encapsulated viruses enter cells fusion of the double lipid layer requires catalysis to overcome a high kinetic barrier and viral fusion proteins are agents that perform this catalytic function 64 although coronavirus uses many different proteins to replicate and invade cells protein s is the main surface protein that it uses to bind to a receptor - this becomes a bridge to the human cell after protein s binds to the human cell receptor the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane allowing the viral genome to enter the human cells and initiate infection 49 the mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 is based on a relatively new genetic method that does not require growing the virus in the laboratory the technique transforms the human body into a living laboratory because the whole process is no longer carried out in the laboratory but directly in the body that received the vaccine 65 the technique is actually based on messenger ribonucleic acid mrna fragments the genetic material that is copied from dna and encodes proteins moderna company loads its vaccine with viral mrna which encodes the proteins of the new coronavirus and then injects it into the body immune cells from the lymph nodes process the mrna and synthesize specific viral protein antigens so that other immune cells recognize them 66 mrna is like a software molecule in the body which then produces viral proteins that can generate an immune response 67 how the body processes the viral protein is often very different from the way it processes the same protein of the vaccine thus one of the theoretical benefits of introducing mrna into a vaccine is that the body causes the viral protein to behave in exactly the same way that the virus would have directed the host to do 63 table i dna vaccines represent the latest direction of development in the manufacture of vaccines vaccines obtained by recombinant dna technology are produced by genetic modification the dna encoding the target molecule is introduced via a plasmid or viral vector in a suitable microorganism or cell line in which dna is expressed and translated into protein the product is subsequently recovered by extraction and purification the injected dna is a plasmid plus a promoter that provides immunogenic protein synthesis 69 an advantage of this type of vaccine is that it stimulates both humoral and cellular immunity also this type of vaccine is stable and does not require maintenance under controlled conditions refrigeration as is the case for conventional vaccines in contrast to live attenuated vaccines the risks arising from a potential inadequate attenuation of vaccine strains are not present in dna vaccines 70 other advantages of this new technology are the fact that the plasmids used are easy to manufacture in large quantities and the immunity conferred is long-term the disadvantages identified so far with regard to dna vaccines are due to the fact that this type of vaccine is limited to protein immunogens 71 a clinical trial for a new dna vaccine against coronavirus has begun this is called chadox1 ncov-19 and it was initially developed to prevent mers 72 this vaccine is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and on sars-cov-2 spike protein 73 it has been modified so that it cannot be reproduced in the human body and the genetic code that transmits instructions for the production of coronavirus spike protein has been added allowing the adenovirus to produce this protein after vaccination the result is the formation of antibodies against the spike protein known to be on the surface of sars-cov-2 74 the ino-4800 vaccine is another new dna vaccine to prevent sars-cov-2 infection it is entering human phase i testing 75 the phase i study will enroll up to 40 healthy adult volunteers each participant will receive two doses of ino-4800 every four weeks and initial immune responses and safety data from the study are expected by the end of the summer preclinical data have shown promising results in immune response in several animal models also the preclinical results for the inovio sars-cov-2 vaccine were consistent with the results of the phase i study for the middle east respiratory syndrome mers vaccine caused by another type of coronavirus here the inovio dna vaccine was well tolerated and induced high levels of antibody response in 95 of subjects generating t cell-mediated responses in nearly 90 of study participants long-term antibody response was maintained for up to 60 weeks in the case of the anti-mers vaccine 75 table ii subunit vaccines contain only certain antigenic determinants of pathogenic microorganisms and are obtained either starting from conventional cultivation processes or by recombinant dna technology 76 antigen determinants included in the vaccine increase the efficiency of the immune response and the presence of a small number of pathogens reduces the risk of side effects subunit vaccines mainly contain surface fragments of pathogens because these types of structures are weak immunogens to obtain vaccines with suitable efficacy the antigens are conjugated with protein molecules 77 antigen purifiers sometimes lead to loss of immunogenicity requiring coupling with a protein carrier or with an aluminum salt however adjuvants are associated with the onset of local reactions to the vaccination site also the duration the immunity conferred by vaccination is lower except for live vaccines 78 table iii along with traditional virus vaccines viral vectors are widely used in which genome of one virus is used to deliver the antigen of another virus thus allowing development of a platform technology of virus production these technologies are available for large-scale production of vaccines drawbacks of such vaccines include a large variation of purification methods need for a reliable confirmation of purity and activity of the virus 79 tables iv and v vaccine development based on the recombinant proteins and virus-like particles vlps is a more innovative approach antiviral vaccines are usually developed on the basis of surface proteins that form vlps production of vlps in the cells with further reconstruction into the stable and immunogenic forms is a multi-stage process substantial issues appear for the vlp production for non-enveloped viruses nucleic acid based vaccines are very interesting from the platform technology viewpoint allowing the same process to be used for the production of different antigens they elicit both humoral and cell immune responses 80 production of these vaccines may be based on e coli cell fermentation and corresponding technologies of extraction and purification of plasmids ensuring their structural integrity 81 table vi another category of vaccines is vaccines containing whole microorganisms but inactivated by chemical or physical methods this type of vaccine has the advantage of higher stability however effectiveness is lower and requires reminders of immune system vaccines with inactivated live virus require stabilization of the structure in the dry form separate supply of the solvent and cold-chain transportation these factors complicate the production process and lead to increase of their cost 82 table vii live attenuated vaccines were the first vaccines utilized these types of vaccines are obtained through cultivation of microorganisms under suboptimal conditions or through successive passage in cultures techniques that determine attenuation of virulence while maintaining the capacity to induce the immune response 83 although characterized as very effective live attenuated vaccines have the disadvantages of risks related to the possible occurrence of mutations leading to the virulence reversal as well as contra-indication in the case of immunocompromised persons table viii the lv-smenp-dc vaccine lentiviral minigene vaccine shenzhen geno-immune medical institute entered phase i clinical trial in march 2020 it is a vaccine based on dendritic cells modified with a lentiviral vector expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domains and is administered with antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes 84 pathogen-specific aapc vaccine shenzhen geno-immune medical institute phase 1 clinical trial 85 is based on lentiviral vector modified artificial antigen presenting cells aapcs expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domains the development and manufacture of a covid-19 vaccine is an urgent issue but it is likely to take many months to resolve although many companies have announced that the covid-19 vaccine will be ready soon this will be quite difficult to do in reality 72 the main reason is that before being put on the market the vaccine should be safe both in the short-term and in the long-term this is very important because in the history of vaccine production there have been situations of contamination with other viruses fortunately without major consequences 16 for example one third of the polio vaccines administered in the us between 1955 and 1963 also contained simian virus 40 sv40 and more recently rotavirus vaccines have been discovered to also have swine circoviruses 86-88 in order to avoid such situations everything to be tested on humans should first be checked for purity and then sterile production lines provided this takes time in rare cases certain antibodies generated by immunization may promote an aggravated form of the disease a situation called ade antibody dependent enhancement 89 when these antibodies re-establish contact with the virus they will actually help it enter the cells and cause infection ade has been described in many viral infections influenza dengue zika etc but also in coronaviruses the mechanism of ade has not been confirmed for coronavirus in humans 90 several animal studies have shown that some types of anti-sars and anti-mers vaccines although effective in generating antibodies can lead to more severe forms of disease when the virus is subsequently inoculated 91 the second reason is that the vaccine must not only be safe but also effective it must be able to determine the synthesis of antibodies of a certain type at a certain concentration titer and to provide protection for a reasonable time however vaccines never generate immunity to all vaccinated people 92 the causes are complex and vary from genetic and immunological factors to the quality of the vaccines themselves and how they are administered age is an important aspect and some influenza studies have shown that aging of the immune system dramatically decreases the effectiveness of vaccination 93 therefore for any future anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine all these aspects should be evaluated and the primary immunization failures minimized by adjusting the doses or number of administrations assuming that the vaccine will generate an effective immune response to a sufficient number of individuals among those vaccinated the time frame of vaccine protection is questionable 94 for example after measles vaccination a small percentage of those who initially respond well lose their protective antibody status within a few years a phenomenon called secondary immunization failure 95 this is why it takes time to check the post-vaccination persistence of anti-covid antibodies last but not least both safety and efficacy are significantly dependent on the type of vaccine ie the technology or platform used some technologies are very new and therefore require more careful testing others are old but need to be adapted for covid-19 another aspect is not only the ability of a company to develop the technology but also its large-scale production capacity so that it is quickly accessible globally because there is no commercially available anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine precedent for the proposed platforms completely new production lines capable of generating billions of doses in a few months must be considered and this must be done without stopping the production of current vaccines already included in the official protocols and guidelines at present this capacity will be reached with difficulty and will represent an unprecedented effort dna and rna vaccines are based on the principle of insertion of these nucleic acids in some cells of the vaccinated ones forcing them to make immunogenic viral proteins 96 although some recent data seem encouraging these concepts have questionable efficiency in humans non-replicative vectors are actually common viruses eg adenovirus genetically modified to display sars-cov proteins on the outer surface 97 but they are so common that many of us have already met with them throughout our lives and as a result we already have immunity and neutralize them before they do their job the attenuated viruses would be variants of sars-cov-2 made less or not at all pathogenic by genetic engineering they are by far the most immunogenic but there is a risk that they will become pathogenic after mutations 98 inactivated viruses viral fragments and synthetic peptides are all relatively weakly immunogenic the analysis of these variables is normally done over 10 years in the form of a trial the stages of a trial are inflexible standardized intensely regulated for the purpose of maximum safety and efficacy of the final vaccine the first stage is the preclinical research in which the technology that will be included in the vaccine is selected and then the efficacy and safety profile of human cells in vitro and animal models in vivo is tested if the expected anti-infectious effect is seen in vitro and cells do not die excessively then in vivo animal studies are conducted mice are usually the perfect candidate for in vivo studies because they are about 85 genetically similar to humans relatively inexpensive and do not raise major ethical issues 99 however one of the notable differences between the human and the mouse is fixed in the case of the ace2 receptor gene to which sars viruses bind during infection mice simply do not make the respiratory syndromes they eliminate the virus relatively quickly from the body this is why it is necessary for either the genetically modified mouse to have a human ace2 receptor or to use ferrets and monkeys and this makes everything much more expensive and more difficult to access the preclinical stage lasts between 1 and 2 years and is by far the most selective it is estimated that less than 20 of the vaccines tested are able to progress to human tests some fail because the product does not work others because they can no longer find financing 1100 after obtaining the vaccine the first people vaccinated will be the highest risk categories for everyone else the term is sometime in 2022 possibly long after we have naturally acquired immunity there are still many unknowns related to coronavirus immunity and that is why obtaining a vaccine is difficult future mutations in sars-cov-2 could occur at any time which automatically means a high risk of any vaccine becoming useless no vaccine has been obtained for any other coronavirus so far and no one can guarantee its success yet it is possible that we will have the anti-covid vaccine in a very short time without having the benefits from long-term testing results the vaccine will probably not be available to all of us for 18 months scientists began working on coronavirus vaccines during sars and mers outbreaks but their efforts did not materialize because of a myriad of difficulties since this extremely severe current coronavirus pandemic covid-19 the spread of the outbreak appears much broader than was the case for sars there is also the possibility of the disease becoming endemic and seasonal in its appearance according to some investigators this explains why many research groups and companies are undertaking efforts to develop an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 all over the world also speeding up all the usual phases needed to develop and test a vaccine in the human an important feature in the landscape of vaccine research and development for sars-cov-2 is represented by the varied range of evaluated technological platforms including nucleic acids dna and rna virus-like particles peptides viral vector replicative and non-replicative recombinant proteins live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses many of these platforms are not currently the basis of vaccines already authorized but experience in areas such as oncology encourages developers to exploit new opportunities for increased development and manufacturing speeds there is not an effective therapy for severe covid-19 and social distancing is extremely costly from a social and economic perspective therefore the development of an effective vaccine along with efforts to implement immune-enhancing strategic treatments and shorter-term efforts to identify tactical repurposed treatments should be considered major public health priorities we hope to get this key tool for disease prevention and to do this quite soon it is unknown whether there ever will be a successful sars-cov-2 vaccine but the efforts of the scientific community in attempting to develop such a vaccine is without precedent thus covid-19 vaccines are a never ending story  why challenge trials of sarscov2 vaccines could be ethical despite risk of severe adverse events nir eyal   
fair and beneficent treatment of participants in a challenge trial depends not simply on reducing the likelihood of severe clinical outcomes such as fatality in the study for participants might have experienced similar or worse events anyhow and it makes no sense to hold such outcomes against the protocol the trial should reduce for each participant and for the entire cohort how much that likelihood exceeds that of commensurate bad outcomes for the same people under two alternative scenarios delineated below which do not involve participation in that particular study the idea is straightforward doctors offer patients surgeries and toxic drugs that may result in severe clinical outcomes or they experiment with new interventions all the time these approaches are perfectly justified when the doctors thereby save these same patients from greater likelihood of similar bad events without the treatment or the experiment one thing that is worse than getting your belly cut for an indicated operation is not undergoing that indicated operation because say you are uninsured the operation injures you and puts you at risk but it usually brings a net benefit to move from the fact that an injured belly would in itself be a harm and a source of risk to the conclusion that being uninsured is a blessing would be fallacious in assessing the risks and the benefits to study participants research ethics heeds not simply the risks of study participation it also heeds the balance of incremental risks and incremental benefits from participation which matters much more
10

 this calculus applies to human challenge trials as well what matters in assessing the offer that researchers make to candidate participants is not simply the socalled absolute risk
11
 better described as the raw or contributing risk that comes with the challengewhether viral exposure poses only minor or controllable risks or alternatively more serious onesbut the net risk the risk from participating in that trial minus the risk that the same person would face otherwise in other words what matters is the full balance of personal risk and benefit the evaluation of a challenge trial ought to look at the difference the trial would make to the participants health or life an institutional review board for example should heed the change in risk exposure that would apply to the participant because she would be in the trial and not in some alternative scenario for judging the ethics of a sarscov2 challenge trial two alternative scenarios to participation in the challenge trial are especially pertinent in one a person declines to participate in any sarscov2 vaccine efficacy test that scenario helps identify how trial participation may affect that person overall for good and for ill in another the same person participates in the competing form of trial namely a standard efficacy trial for the same vaccine the latter would result in delay but it may be tempting to argue that it is kinder to study participants and hence more ethical to compare personal risks between the two studies we shall look at the participants average counterpart in the efficacy study whether or not the participant of the challenge trial can herself join a standard efficacy study 
it turns out that compared to either of these two alternative scenarios both for each individual and for the cohort the net risk from participating in a sarscov2 vaccine challenge would be negative small or unclear the net risk could not be clearly very large differently put a sarscov2 challenge trial may turn out to constitute indirectly beneficial research for study participantsso that they would be medically disadvantaged if ultimately excluded from it or if they were admitted to a standard efficacy trial instead properly done a challenge trial certainly would not expose participants to a known far higher prospect of net harm than would either of these alternatives how might introducing a sometimes deadly and incurable pathogen into the body of a perfectly healthy person improve that persons health and welfare prospects the explanation lies in the peculiarities of the current pandemic which features a highly transmissible virus and overwhelms health systems worldwide for any individual the probability of incurring death or disability from an infection is a x b where a stands for the probability of getting infected and b stands for the probability of either dying from or developing a longterm disability as a result of the infection what is a x b if an individual participates in a challenge trial what is it if she declines what is it if she participates instead in a standard efficacy trial is the probability largest in the first case and by enough to justify blocking willing and decisionally capacitated adults from enabling highly valuable trials to gauge the magnitude of a x b in a challenge trial versus outside any trial versus in a standard efficacy trial let us look separately at a and at b in each of these three scenarios when people assume that challenge trials are very dangerous to participate in they usually focus on a the probability of getting infected under these three scenarios for any candidate participant the likelihood of getting infected is clearly greater with the challenge trials artificial challenge than if the person either declines to participate in any trial or participates in a standard efficacy trial however in the sarscov2 case the research team can and should select participants for whom the probability of infection is least larger in a challenge trial recent models predict widespread worldwide exposure to this coronavirus some areas are likely to experience infection rates of greater than 50
12
 and the proposal is to recruit only from areas with ongoingly or expected high transmission rates
13
 since the world is a large and variegated place and candidate selection can be careful and targeted there should be many outlier areas among which to choose where the probability of getting infected later would be very high at the time of candidate selection because expedited vaccine trials could shorten the current global economic recession and prevent many deaths worldwide it would make perfect sense to invest in carefully selecting and then safely transporting a few hundred healthy candidate participants from hightransmission areas to the isolated research centerseven across international borders in light of the public health emergency related red tape should be removed if participants are selected in that way the challenge trial is much likelier to hasten participants exposure than to impose an exposure that they would have otherwise avoided in the rare event that exposure kills a participant the earlier exposure could mean that the individual dies a few months sooner than if exposed to the virus outside the trial design but this temporal factor seems less significant than the substantial effect trial participation could have on how likely the person is to die with appropriate trial procedures and smart participant selection b the probability of dying or developing disability if infected would be smaller in a challenge trial it may be much smaller first the proposed trial design includes frequent monitoring that may catch disease and enable participants to receive supportive care and any therapeutics proven by that point very early probably before any complications develop
14
 outside the challenge trials by contrast testing could be scarce and many carriers could remain asymptomatic which impedes a testandtreat approach that may be deemed promising for some patients any therapeutics proven by then might not be universally available yet
so long as challenge participants are selected and supported as recommended the prospective harms properly understood as the incremental harms are unlikely to far exceed the benefits for individual participants they could actually be smaller
it would be only prudent and fair toward trial participants to prioritize them for any novel therapeutics
15
 challenge trials for a sarscov2 vaccine should also offer guaranteed access to standardofcare lifesustaining treatments including immediate assistance during cardiac arrest as lifesupport services reach capacity in many parts of the developed world over the coming months patients from hightransmission areas who develop severe disease will often die outside trials it is true that according to reports published so far most covid patients who rely on critical care do not survive
16
 but crucially here younger covid patients who need critical care tend to survive
17
 in the united kingdom for example of the covid patients aged 16 to 39 whose critical care outcomes were reported by may 15 2020 819 had been released from critical care
18
 it is also true that a period in intensive care for covid19 treatment may leave patients physically or psychologically disabled
19
 but the option of receiving critical care which significantly helps prevent the very worst outcome of shortterm fatality is clearly a substantial medical benefit because for young patients with severe covid19 the absence of lifesustaining interventions makes a big difference between likely survival and no chance at all the probability of averting death in the event of infection would be substantially better inside a challenge trial than outside any trial and this probability would be somewhat larger than in a standard efficacy trial which would find it somewhat harder to provide that full guarantee of support to its thousands of participants in short if researchers conducting challenge trials act as recommended admittedly the probability of getting infected would remain larger inside a challenge trial than either outside any trial or in a standard efficacy trial but the probability of death or disability is likely to be much smaller inside a challenge trial than in these alternative scenarios overall a x b could be smaller for any individual inside the challenge trial than either outside any trial or in a standard efficacy trial what the individual would lose in the probability of averting infection with that probability rising she could gain in better protection from death even if eventually with more data and calculations a x b turns out to be equal under these alternative scenarios or slightly better under them here is what is unlikely to be the case dynamic and uncertain data notwithstanding that a x b is much much smaller if a properly selected and treated individual does not participate in any trial or if she partakes in a standard efficacy trial instead this matters in espousing a limit on how risky participating in a trial may justifiably be contemporary research ethicists usually describe what exceeds that limit in terms of extremely high net risk to the participant the limit is surpassed only when the overall balance of prospective medical harms and medical benefits to the participant is highly adverse
20

 there is another important welfare or borderlinemedical benefit from participation some potential challenge participants simply could not extinguish risk of getting exposed say because they have to leave home for essential work they could not extinguish it either by declining to participate in any trial or by participating in a standard efficacy trial instead among them those who live with others would understandably worry about infecting household members including in some cases old or frail relatives they would know that if reinfection is rare or impossible something that scientists are still examining they would not infect them as long as their own infection and infectious period take place in isolation putting at least a temporary end to the risk of infecting others would help keep their loved ones alivesurely a substantial benefit
21
 by contrast if they do not join any study or if they participate in a standard efficacy study the probability of infecting those dearest to them could remain substantial all in all so long as challenge participants are selected and supported as recommended above the prospective harms properly understood as the incremental harms are unlikely to far exceed the benefits for individual participants they could actually be smaller to sum up so far the answer to the right question about the appreciation in net risk is that on balance challenge trial participation could be either prospectively beneficial or neutral or slightly prospectively harmfulcertainly not highly prospectively harmful therefore it cannot justify paternalistic protection when adults with the requisite decisionmaking capacity wish to help researchers do enormous good one objection is that my argument compares participation in a challenge trial to the wrong scenarios the correct comparison it could be objected is to idealized circumstancesof greater justice otherwise a vaccine producer might exploit unjust background strife of candidate participants to offer them less safety than it should
22

 to exploit someone is roughly to use their unjust disadvantage to ones unfair advantage leaving them with less than they should have
23
 for example a sweatshop owner makes to potential workers a worse offer than she should the pay is unfairly low and the degree of safety is not what it should be exploiting their alternatives which are unfairly even worsestarvation for instance the fundamental problem here may have to do with the distributive consequences say that the owner winds up with too much and the workers too little or with the workers effective inability to decline the offer or simply with the perverse relation in which the owner stands to them whatever the fundamental problem may be we usually consider this problematic and inasmuch as widespread infections and lack of access to critical care flow from injustices one could claim that recruiters for human challenge trials or the societies they serve are likewise exploiting an unjust disadvantage instead one could argue the appropriate comparator of participating in a challenge trial is living in a world free of these injustices or their disadvantageous sequelae indeed two senior french doctors were recently condemned for having proposed testing coronavirus vaccines in african patients based on assumptions about african nations financial inability to fight the virus effectively
24
 while the backlash probably had more to do with unsympathetic and somewhat racist suggestions that these doctors made on the occasion the potential exploitation of background economic injustices may also have been a concern the challenge trials i discuss here would probably take place in leading research centers in the richest countries but inside these countries transmission rates and the need for unavailable critical care services may typically end up being worst in impoverished minority and undocumented migrant neighborhoods among the uninsured and underinsured and among other victims of societal injustice some unethical historical challenge trials were done on such participants improving these participants overall risk exposure compared to their unjust alternatives
25
 while these historical comparisons are obviously inappropriate given that these abuses also involved violations of consent of independent review and so forth
26
 their unethical nature may also have involved the exploitation of background injustices
27
 does the potential for that kind of exploitation undermine my case for testing sarscov2 vaccines through the challenge trial design there is a simple answer to the concern about exploitation to avoid preying on victims of injustice likely to live in certain areas all research teams need to do is recruit elsewhere the world is a big place and unfortunately there will be plenty of areas with ongoing and expected high transmission as well as devastating demand for critical care services even absent grossly unjust background poverty disparities lack of insurance and the like some locales are experiencing or can expect a surge in covid19 cases for reasons other than preexisting systemic injusticesimply because of bad luck or even warranted choices that panned out poorly for example governments may not have invested a great portion of health care funds in intensive care units and supplies in the years before the pandemic in favor of investing in costeffective interventions that over time promote population health and longevity more researchers could always focus recruitment on such locales indeed although researchers should recruit from hightransmission areas those need not be areas of the very highest transmission rates if the latter locales correlate closely with background injustices some other areas that are generally betteroff would do of course it is impossible to project which locales will have become hightransmission areas when it is time to test the efficacy of each candidate vaccine for illustrative purposes however consider middleclass areas of stockholm if social democratic swedens recent choices to avoid social distancing turn out to have been epidemiologically mistaken not quite the same thing as unjust
28
 again transporting a few hundred candidate participants from afar even across borders to the research center is a rational financial and administrative investment toward alleviating a deep recession a second answer is that in this instance research teams may be able to recruit volunteers driven not solely by promoting their own health but also by altruism the nonprofit 1day sooner is collating contact details of potential volunteers for live sarscov2 challenge trials and reports over 21000 applications at the time of this writing
29
 many potential volunteers study or teach at elite academic institutions many are selfidentified effective altruists who recount past altruistic acts while selfreports ought to be taken with caution it may turn out that enough participants would volunteer with full comprehension of the medical risks perhaps out of altruism and not because of misunderstandingand not because they have suffered systemic injustice that makes them vulnerable to exploitation avoiding financial incentives for participation would further help select volunteers with the best motives
30
 the causal route to their participation would not exploitatively rely on offering benefits to thwart major injustices toward them a third answer is that the ethics around nonexploitation is complex avoiding exploitation as defined above would mean that some victims of injustice are denied any benefits of trial participation and that many people like them of the same racial minority for example or as undernourished as they are are denied the benefit of the vaccines having been tested in people like them the upshot of showing that an action would be exploitative is therefore unclear sometimes it is much better to be exploited than not to be exploited finally even if exploiting unjust strife were unavoidable in challenge trials of sarscov2 vaccines concerns about exploitation would not be strong enough to unseat the otherwise very strong case for these trials it is true that even with a study volunteers willing consent and even given the need to thwart a public health disaster some research ethicists not all
31
 would consider high likelihood of grave harm to a volunteer to remain forbidden
32
 but no one i know seriously argues that worries about beneficial perfectly consensual research that is marred merely by an exploitative route to benefit and consent is enough to ban a study that can be expected to save an inordinate number of lives remember that the challenge trial design could cut several months in the wait for vaccine rollout translating into thousands or millions of lives spared from exponential growth in direct covid deaths
33
 true only a third to one half of all vaccine efficacy trials lead to vaccine approval
34
 and there is some chance that none of the over 100 extant vaccine candidates will work or that an approved vaccine will not be rolled out widely but even a portion of the potential lives that might be spared thanks to sarscov2 vaccine challenge trials from covid death from death or serious harm from other diseases that are neglected during the pandemic and from famines and halted economic development during months of delay could be a very large number of lives spared put more dramatically the main factor resting on one side of the moral scale is a significant chance at averting a great number of deathsprobably vastly more than in the 20142016 ebola outbreak with 11315 deaths or even the 2004 indian ocean tsunami with around 250000 deaths what stands on the other side is not averting serious net harm to an individual which is the consideration that some research ethicists count more the complaint on that side is that while admittedly challenge trial participation could benefit that individual on balance and she could rationally and autonomously choose to enroll the causal roots of that benefit are impure this is not a balance that would stop any serious research ethicist from approving a crucial trial for all these reasons the concern about exploitation even if applicable and cogent cannot unseat the initial case for conducting challenge trials this is not to say that researchers should ignore that concern it may affect how best to conduct the trialssay by recruiting from areas with high transmission rates but no blatant injustices still some form of challenge trial remains permissible and to accelerate vaccine rollout highly recommended ethically challenge trials should enroll individuals only with their fully free and informed consent
35
 but with some medical trials just or unjust background circumstances are so dire that they leave candidate participants no reasonable option except to enroll perhaps that is what troubles ethicists who consider challenge trials and warn about dire background injustices it may also be part of what worries some about the quality of consent in trials of novel cancer therapeutics which give terminal patients a last hope to fight off a cancer that is irresponsive to approved treatments
36
 in a sense these desperate patients cannot because they cannot afford to say no and are forced to participate in english when one chooses the less bad of two bad options one is often said to have been forced or compelled to make that choice
37
 all this may seem to invalidate any consent that people in dire circumstances may give to trial participation and may make their inclusion in the trial unfree and one could argue wrongful and given the effects of the current pandemic anyone joining a challenge trial for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus may be said to be forced to participate this argument that bad alternatives to trial participation invalidate consent to participate cannot work it would forbid many ordinary participant selection procedures for cancer therapy research it could even absurdly invalidate consent to advanced cancer care on the parallel ground that the patient cannot afford to say no but the argument is even more questionable when applied to vaccine research the risk profile of someone who knows that she has advanced cancer is very different from that of someone wholike vaccine trial recruitshas not been infected and is therefore at far less dramatic risk especially if research teams recruit only young and healthy individuals for whom even infection is highly unlikely to translate into severe disease recruits should not feel desperate or compelled to participate in the trial for their own healths sakes what i argued above is only that there are health benefits from participation not that recruits should feel desperate for them if some persistently do they should be excluded in the consent process for misunderstanding relevant facts or on psychiatric grounds in that respect since we should permit these cancer studies we should also permit human challenge studies of novel coronavirus vaccines some vaccine candidates may turn out only in efficacy testing to be toxic
38
 some may turn out only during efficacy testing to enhance covid19 severity manifold
39
 the greater the chance for vaccine safety issues the better in that respect for individuals to decline to participate in trials
40
 this may suggest that participating in the challenge trial is prospectively harmful after all let me offer four responses first challenge trial participants would prospectively benefit in other ways and so may still prospectively benefit overallthis risk notwithstanding second that chance for vaccine safety issues is as likely per person to arise in standard efficacy trials assuming that some form of efficacy testing of vaccines is legitimate in this crisis this factor should not weigh against challenge trials third in standard efficacy trials toxicity and severe disease are much less safe for participants because they erupt in the field not in a controlled medical environment with frequent monitoring and guaranteed medical help
41
 therefore vaccine unsafety is far more dangerous to a participant in a standard efficacy trial than to one in a challenge trial fourth in standard efficacy trials any risk of toxicity or enhanced severity accrues to 10 to 50 times as many participants for the simple reason that such trials require 10 to 50 times as many participants in short appropriate concern about enhanced severity cannot constitute an advantage of standard efficacy trials over a human challenge trial quite the contrary it only strengthens the ethical case for challenge trials to replace standard efficacy testing of vaccines against the novel coronavirus i have argued that if challenge trials are done right the incremental risk from participation in them may be smaller than the incremental benefit from it the main benefit invoked was priority access to critical care and therapeutics in the event of severe covid19 however that benefit may seem irrelevant or tertiary to some either because harm allegedly matters more than benefits or because this particular benefit is indirect contempt for mere benefits merits only a short response researchers as well as clinicians appropriately offer countermeasures known to be riskier when the expected benefits exceed the expected risks while some benefits such as mere enhancement and mere financial benefit might be less important than a trials primary benefit to the participant others are clearly as important the benefits discussed here are in terms of avoiding covid19 fatalitythe main risk under consideration indeed it is not even clear what counts as reduction in incremental risk and what as increase in incremental benefit
42

 what is worth further discussion is the worry that these lifesaving benefits are nevertheless merely indirect because they would not arise from receiving the intervention being studied
43
 nor is treatment for covid19 among the clinical benefits of the procedures that are scientifically necessary to test the experimental intervention under study
44
 an anonymous reviewer of an earlier version of this article thought that indirect benefits should not count toward the assessment of study participants balance of personal risks and personal benefits lest researchers address any major risk with financial compensation or still other indirect benefits however for the purposes of this article we can set aside the question whether money can ever adequately compensate for acute medical risk again priority access to covid19related critical care is a medical not a financial benefit it directly addresses the main risk of challenge participation namely premature covid19related mortality how can such an indirect benefit not count in addition some benefits from participation in a covid19 challenge trial would be direct benefits consider potentially better protection for ones family if infection provides longterm immunity and a safer environment for episodes of enhanced disease severity compared to the environment for standard efficacy trial participants these benefits emanate directly from the best scientific way to hold the study furthermore scholars who have looked at indirect benefits usually propose including them in institutional review boards riskbenefit calculations
45
 or even on informed consent forms
46
 in fact the questionable in my view regulatory block on invoking indirect benefits pertains in the united states only to research on people who cannot provide informed consent such as children
47
 and is irrelevant to the present case of challenge trials on decisionally capacitated adults
48

 even the benefit of better access to critical care and therapeutics in a challenge trial than in ones hightransmission area is borderline direct while not strictly speaking scientifically necessary to test the experimental intervention under study this care would be part of trial safety it is not ancillary care or retroactive compensation for a trial that risks covid19 fatality instead it preempts high risk of covid fatality resulting from the viral exposure in the study access to critical care is also ethically owed to study participants per most accounts of research ethics anyhow critical care is not experimental treatment that as such might not be owed nor is it in rich countries so exquisitely rare that despite participants especially strong claim to it they should be denied it not to offer critical care would be preposterous in a challenge trial for a deadly disease that critical care helps treat far from an afterthought to appease those protesting an unfair riskbenefit ratio critical care is owed in the first place what if a candidate participant who hails from a hightransmission area actually has low risk of getting infected for a reason that sets her apart from her neighbors such as being personally willing and able to isolate herself extraordinarily well then there is an important sense in which trial participation could harm that individual greatly in the trial exposure would be certain whereas outside the trial it would remain unlikely

 researchers should go some way toward identifying and excluding such individuals for example by asking about candidate participants work and household arrangements or even surveying them on risk behavior perhaps informed consent forms should exhort candidate participants to consider personal risk factors and avoid participation if they are highly unlikely to get exposed naturally however just as some participants would have less risk of natural exposure than researchers could know others would have greater risk of natural exposure than researchers could know researchers should ascribe to candidates the average risk level for the risk category package they investigate by sticking with the average nonomniscient researchers are as likely to introduce more net harm than expected as they are to introduce less net harm than expected it should all balance out and the risk exposure that researchers are ethically responsible for is arguably the one that they know or could with reasonable effort find out about not the objective one discussed here 
as i have argued the right ethical question about human challenge trials for sarscov2 vaccines is not the commonly raised one about their likelihood of leading to deaths and other severe adverse events given the diseases seriousness and the current lack of proven therapeutics the right question is whether challenge trials would increase study participants likelihood of similar bad outcomes compared to two alternative scenarios nonparticipation in any trial and participation in standard efficacy trials for the same vaccines as shown surprisingly compared to these two alternatives human challenge studies would on balance probably benefit or at least not dramatically harm study participants challenge trials could also reduce the overall prospect of harm in the participant cohort with respect to sarscov2 ethicists should not advocate a ban on a trial design that may accelerate a proven vaccines rollout by months just because risks were calculated the wrong way let us not miss our chance to quash the current global crisis earlier through perfectly permissible research a further conclusion follows based on the ethical requirement to give participants a fair balance of risks and benefits it need not be important to recruit individuals or a cohort who would be at low risk of bad outcomes in the trial the balance of risks and benefits may turn out to be similar for participants who would be at low risk in the trial such as young and healthy individuals and for ones who would be at high risk such as older people and individuals who have relevant underlying health problems it may turn out that compared to these alternative scenarios challenge trial participation is prospectively beneficial or not very harmful for all potential recruits including highrisk ones if and when that is indeed the case it would seem compatible with sensibly calculated riskbenefit requirements to recruit for a challenge trial not only young and healthy people

 for whom both risks and benefits are low it would also seem permissible to recruit old people and people who live with health conditions that make them especially vulnerable to covid19 people for whom both risks and benefits are high all could benefit or at least not lose a lot in their prospects compared to if they do not participate and compared to if they participate in a standard efficacy trial recruiting an ample number of participants from several such vulnerable populations may allow us to skip further testing for vaccine safety

 or efficacy in populations earlier excluded from the efficacy study and move straight to conditional approval and alongside further rigorous testing in broader populations wide rollout additional months would be saved in the race to a universal vaccine rollout other ethical considerations may be thought to weigh against recruiting older patients and patients with conditions that increase risk from infection one is that their recruitment could increase the risk that some patients would die from trial procedures undermining public trust another is that for these higherrisk populations the benefit of guaranteed access to therapeutics and lifesustaining interventions in the event of severe infection might be crucial enough to force them to participate in the sense expounded above whether these two considerations are sensible and weighty enough to forgo cutting additional months from the process is a question that i shall leave for another day funding for this work comes from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases through grant ai11461706 hiv cure studies risk risk perception and ethics for helpful comments i am grateful to paul firth scott halpern samia

universally recommended for children - us 1990-98 mmwr 48 577-581 modified 94  vaccination is one of the most significant public health interventions ever made sparing millions of people from infectious diseases it has been calculated that use of currently available vaccines saves more than eight million lives annually which corresponds to one person saved every five seconds these remarkable results have been achieved in 200 years of vaccination history which are largely based on two basic simple technologies the inactivation of toxins and pathogens with formaldehyde treatment first performed by glenny and hopkins in 1923 and ramon in 1924 1 2 3  and the stable attenuation of pathogens by serial passage in vitro from 1920 to 1980 these now easy technologies were applied to develop vaccines that have been used worldwide to control or even eradicate many infectious diseases one of the most brilliant successes of vaccination is the eradication of smallpox virus in 1977 it has been estimated that to date smallpox eradication has spared the global community of some 350 million new smallpox victims and about 40 million deaths from the disease the annual savings as a result of vaccination being stopped and hospitals being able to be converted to other uses is estimated to be in excess of us 2000 million each year 4  vaccination has also resulted in the elimination of poliovirus from the americas in 1994 western pacific in 2000 and europe in june 2002 the goal of the who global polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of wild poliovirus by end-2004 leading to global certification by 2008 overall since the initiative was launched in 1988 the number of cases has fallen by over 99 from an estimated 350000 cases to the 89 cases reported in the first three months of 2004 in the same period the number of polio-infected countries was reduced from 125 to 6 5  moreover the incidence of seven other frightening diseases diphtheria measles rubella mumps pertussis haemophilus influenzae type b -hib - and tetanus has fallen by more than 98 in those states where the related vaccines have been introduced see tab 1 chiron vaccines via fiorentina 1 53100 siena italy the historical technologies for vaccine production have achieved remarkable successes but the battle against infectious diseases has not been won during the last several million years of existence on earth microorganisms have learnt how to escape the surveillance of our immune system either hiding themselves from host responses or developing the capacity of infecting different hosts these two main mechanisms of pathogen defense explain why vaccines against several pathogens such as hiv hcv streptococcus pyogenes staphylococcus aureus plasmodium falciparum schistosoma spp and others are difficult to develop and are not yet available moreover during the last 25 years there has been a big revolution in microbial ecology pathogens that have circulated since many years but whose existence was ignored were discovered hcv metapneumovirus etc old pathogens have changed their geographical habitat and have been introduced into new areas where they have become endemic eg west nile virus in north america completely new pathogens have emerged and pose a serious threat to human health hiv sars coronavirus etc pathogens thought to be controlled have re-emerged mycobacterium tuberculosis etc tab 2 it was soon clear that the old vaccine strategies were unable to face with the new challenges posed by infectious diseases and modern approaches were needed therefore from the beginning of the 1980s taking advantage of the better understanding of the immune system and the emergence of the recombinant dna technologies new vaccines were developed tab 3 moreover nowadays the range of technologies and strategies available for vaccine development is extremely broad the availability of the whole genomic sequences of many pathogens is considered a real revolution and table 1  universal routine vaccination reduced by more than 98 the incidence of nine harmful diseases from the us and eradicated two of them smallpox and polio max  it is now common knowledge that the capsular polysaccharide of many important bacterial pathogens is their major virulence factor and that vaccination using purified polysaccharides could protect people from those diseases polysaccharide vaccines have been developed against neisseria meningitidis serogroup a mena group c men c group y meny and group w135 men w135 in the late 1960s 6 7  against h influenzae type b in the 1980s 8  against 23 types of streptococcus pneumoniae in the early 1990s 9  and against salmonella typhi in the mid 1990s 10  however the use of all these vaccines is inadequate polysaccharides are t-independent antigens their immunogenicity and efficacy is very poor or absent in infants so that they are unsuitable to be included in the infant routine immunization schedule the solution was found by covalently linking the sugar to a carrier protein conjugation this procedure converts t-independent antigens into tdependent ones by providing a source of appropriate t-cell epitopes present in the carrier protein conjugation technology is one of the biggest achievements of the novel vaccination strategies the capacity of transforming poor immunogens such as polysaccharides into excellent immuno-novel vaccination strategies 79  the first conjugate vaccine developed was the one against haemophilus influenzae type b hib 11  hib is a respiratory pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of human infections before the availability of the hib conjugate vaccine hib was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis especially in infants in most developed and developing countries worldwide resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality the first hib conjugated vaccine was introduced in the us in december 1987 for children 18 months of age and older subsequently more immunogenic vaccines were introduced in us as well as in many other countries in the early 1990s for the use in infants from the age of two months within a few years the effectiveness and public impact of hib conjugate vaccines on hib disease has been demonstrated in all those countries that have introduced the vaccination 12 in the us the annual cases of hib invasive disease among children under five years of age decreased from more than 20000 of the pre-vaccination era 13  to less than 50 in 2002 14  in general the decrease in incidence of disease has exceeded that predicted on the basis of estimated proportion of the population that is completely immunized suggesting that the vaccine use is able to generate herd immunity on this topic many studies have shown that hib conjugated vaccines are able to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage 15-18 which gives a major contribution to herd immunity precisely how hib conjugate immunization reduces nasopharyngeal colonization whether this impact is due to decreased acquisition or decreased duration of carriage is not clear additional work on the immunology and microbiology of transmission and carriage is needed to clarify this issue on the other hand reduction of hib carriage may open ecological niches for h influenzae non-type b strains 80 maria lattanzi and rino rappuoli  the seven serotypes in the first licensed conjugate vaccine account for  80 of isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid of children aged  2 years in the us compared with  60 of isolates from older children and adults in us and with  60 of isolates from young children in latin america and asia 25 26  the seven-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has been recommended in us for all infants as three primary doses approximately at 2 4 and 6 months of age and one booster dose at the ages of 12 and 15 months 27  this vaccine repeated the successes of the hib conjugate vaccine showing high efficacy in preventing meningitis and efficacy although to less extent in preventing pneumonia 28 and acute otitis media 29 due to the vaccine serotypes moreover several studies have established that the conjugate vaccine is effective also in reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of the serotypes covered by the vaccine potentially extending the benefits beyond those children who are vaccinated post licensure evaluation of the efficacy of the seven-valent conjugated vaccine found that the reduction in disease was greater than the percentage of children who have been vaccinated with evidence of herd immunity 30  neisseria meningitis group c conjugate vaccines began clinical development at the end of the 1980s and after extensive clinical studies during the 1990s were proved to be safe and capable of inducing highly bactericidal and boostable immune responses in infants and children 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  these vaccines were first introduced in the united kingdom in late 1999 to be used for a countrywide vaccination initiative population-based active surveillance monitored age-specific and capsular group-specific incidence of disease and estimated vaccine coverage 40  the results were impressive within 18 months of vaccine introduction the cases of menc diseases almost disappeared in the vaccinated population with an estimated vaccine efficacy of 90 or above in all targeted age groups 41  according to a large carriage study performed in the united kingdom the vaccine induced also a 66 decrease in the carriage of menc strain with no evidence of any increase in carriage of menb isolates or other capsular groups 42  moreover the vaccine provides some evidence of herd immunity as there is also a reduction of menc disease in unvaccinated individuals ranging from 34 percent 9-14 years old to 61 percent 15-17 years old 43  since 1999 the menc conjugate vaccine has been licensed in many european countries and also in canada and australia either as routine infant immunization or for catch-up programs of varying forms multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines containing groups a c y and w135 are in clinical development introduction of these vaccines into routine infant andor toddler immunization programs could have a substantial effect on the incidence of meningococcal disease 44 45  in the 1970s it was discovered that protection towards hepatitis b is correlated to the presence of antibodies against the surface antigen of the virus hbsag which circulates in the bloodstream of infected subjects in large quantities these discoveries led to the development of first generation plasma-derived hbsag subunit vaccines first licensed in the us in 1982 46  concerns about safety of blood products and the advances of recombinant dna technology conducted to the development of second-generation recombinant subunit vaccines produced in yeast or in mammalian cells 47  which were first licensed in us in 1986 the application of the recombinant dna technology has the advantage to produce safer vaccines than the plasma-derived ones and in unlimited supplies this recombinant hbv vaccine is highly effective a standard course of three doses induces protective levels of anti-hbs ie 10 miuml in over 95 of healthy infants children and adolescents and in more than 90 of healthy adults younger than 40 years after the age of 40 immunogenicity drops below 90 however and by the age of 60 years 65 to 75 of vaccinees develop protective anti hbs titers 48 49 50  moreover the vaccine prevents development of chronic hepatitis in at least 75 of early-vaccinated infants born from hbeag-positive mothers 51  cost-benefit analyses have strongly supported the introduction of universal immunization against hbv to newborns 52  since 1992 the who has called for all countries to add hepatitis b vaccine into their national childhood immunization schedules and substantial progress has been made in implementing this recommendation by the end of 2003 more than 160 countries worldwide will have introduced the vaccine 53  substantial help in achieving this goal has been given by the global alliance for vaccines and immunization gavi and the vaccine fund which since 2000 began to provide technical and financial support to introduce routine hbv immunization into 71 of the worlds poorest countries 54  the effectiveness of routine infant hbv immunization in significantly reducing or eliminating the prevalence of chronic hbv infection has been demonstrated in a variety of countries and settings the experience in taiwan is particularly impressive universal vaccination decreased the prevalence of hbsag carriage in children younger than 15 years of age from 98 in 1984 to 07 in 1999 55  moreover rates of hepatocellular carcinoma hcc among cohorts of children born after routine infant immunization have started in the mid 1980s declined by greater than 50 56  these results clearly show that the hbv vaccine is the first successful anti-cancer vaccine opening the way to other anti-cancer vaccines like vaccines against human papilloma virus hpv that causes cervical cancer 57  or helicobacter pylori responsible for many gastric cancers 58  the first example of a vaccine developed with a new rational strategic design taking advantage of the power of the molecular biology and genomic technologies is the recombinant acellular pertussis vaccine a vaccine composed of the whole killed bordetella pertussis cells has been available for mass vaccination since the late 1940s 59  this vaccine is very efficacious in preventing the disease but the presence of severe adverse reactions although no proof exists of their having been caused by the vaccine brought about a drop in vaccine compliance in the 1970s and stressed the need for a new safer vaccine a considerable amount of work was initially required to identify the bacterial antigens responsible for the induction of protection pertussis toxin pt was then identified as a major protective antigen while other antigens such as adenylate cyclase filamentous haemagglutinin fha pertactin and the fimbriae were found to provide some help in protective immunity several researchers developed acellular pertussis vaccines containing purified pt inactivated by the old classical chemical treatment with formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde however it is recognized that this treatment of pt may be associated with significant reversion rates 60  to overcome these problems the pertussis toxin was detoxified by using the powerful tools of molecular biology to make stable changes by sitedirected mutagenesis to the amino acids responsible for the toxicity of pertussis toxin this molecular approach allowed the development of a natu-rally nontoxic molecule inactivated by a rational design that did not need a denaturing chemical treatment 61  the genetically detoxified pt had successfully shown its safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials both in adult volunteers and in infants and children either as a monovalent mutant pt alone 62 63  or in association with fha and pertactin 64 65  and also with fha and pertactin in association with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids dtap 66 67  these trials showed that the different acellular vaccine formulations containing the non-toxic pt mutant were extremely safe and much safer than the wholecell pertussis vaccines furthermore all formulations induced high titers of anti-pt neutralizing antibodies and very strong antigen-specific t-cell proliferative responses interestingly enough five to six years after the primary immunization schedule this vaccine still exhibited an efficacy of about 80 and both antigen-specific antibody and cd4  t-cell responses were still detectable at significant levels 68 69  the new strategy used to develop this genetically detoxified acellular pertussis vaccine shows that this approach can provide tremendous advantages eliciting very high protective immune responses with very low amounts of antigen despite the introduction of these new strategies conjugation recombinant dna etc one of the major issues for the development of new vaccines is the identification of protective antigens from a microorganism biochemical immunological and microbiological methods have been successful in many cases but they require the pathogen to be grown in laboratory conditions are time-consuming and allow for the identification only of the most abundant antigens which can be purified in quantities suitable for vaccine testing unfortunately in many instances the most abundant proteins could not be good vaccine candidates moreover the antigens expressed in vivo during the infection could not be expressed in vitro to the same extent furthermore when dealing with non-cultivable pathogens there is no approach to vaccine development the availability of the complete genome sequence of a free-living organism h influenzae 70 marked the beginning of the genomic era that opened novel strategies in vaccine design the possibility of determining the whole sequence of a genome bacterial viral or parasitic led to the idea of using the genomic information to discover novel antigens that have been missed by conventional vaccinology this approach called reverse vaccinology involves the computer in silico analysis of the microbial genome sequence and predicts those antigens that are most likely to be vaccine candidates 71 72  the success of genomic-based strategies for vaccine development is highly dependent on the criteria used for the in silico selection of the potential antigens which are usually secreted or extracellular proteins more easily accessible to antibodies than intracellular ones several approaches can be used to mine genomic sequences and the appropriate combination of various algorithms and the critical evaluation of the information generated are essential for the proper selection of the antigens the in silico approach results in the selection of a large number of genes therefore it is necessary to use simple procedures that allow large numbers of genes to be cloned and expressed like robotics and pcr the product of each pcr reaction is cloned and screened for expression in a heterologous system successful expression depends on the predicted localization of the protein integral transmembrane proteins have proven to be particularly difficult to produce by recombinant techniques in e coli once purified the recombinant proteins are used to immunize mice and the post-immunization sera are analyzed to verify the computer-predicted surface localization of each polypeptide and their ability to elicit a quantitative and qualitative immune protective response the genomic approach has many novel features and advantages there is no need to cultivate the pathogen as the whole process starts in silico it could be equally applied to cultivable and non-cultivable microorganisms pathogens dangerous to handle can be studied as easily as commensals virtually all protein antigens encoded by the pathogens genome could become vaccine candidates regardless whether they are expressed in vitro or in vivo abundant or scarce this process allows the identification of all the antigens seen by the conventional methods and the discovery of novel antigens that work on a totally different paradigm unfortunately reverse vaccinology suffers from limitations related to our incomplete knowledge of vaccine immunology a rate-limiting step of the process is linked to the rarity or more often absence of widely accepted correlates of protection and reliable animal models of infection the other constraint of this approach is the inability to identify non-protein antigens such as polysaccharides and cd-1 restricted antigens such as glycolipids which represent new promising vaccine candidates meningococcus b represents the first example of the application of the genomic approach and the demonstration of the power of this novel strategy for target antigen identification 73  conventional approaches to menb vaccine development have been ineffective for more than 40 years a capsular polysaccharide-based approach which has been extremely successful for other major meningococcal serogroups cannot be used for this strain because the menb capsular polysaccharide is identical to a widely distributed human carbohydrate 2-8n-acetyl neuraminic acid or polysialic acid this condition not only makes the polysaccharide a poor immunogen for humans but also a potential generator of autoantibodies on the other hand a protein-based approach developed using surfaceexposed proteins contained in outer membrane vesicles omvs has shown to have efficacy in clinical trials only against homologous strains especially in children below five years of age because of the high sequence variability of the major protein antigens 74  using the reverse vaccinology dna fragments were screened by computer analysis while the n meningitidis sequencing project was in progress the screening was aimed to select proteins predicted to be on the surface of the bacterium or to have homologies to known bacterial factors involved in pathogenesis and virulence after clearance of cytoplasmic proteins and known neisseria antigens 570 genes predicted to code for surface-exposed or membrane-associated proteins were recognized successful cloning in e coli and expression was achieved for 350 proteins which were then purified and tested for localization immunogenicity and protective efficacy in animal models of the 85 proteins found to be surface exposed 22 were able to induce complement-mediated bactericidal antibody response which is the most convincing indication of the capability of inducing protective immunity in addition to test the appropriateness of these proteins as candidate antigens for conferring protection against heterologous strains the proteins were evaluated for gene presence phase variation and sequence conservation in a panel of genetically diverse menb strains representative of the global diversity of the natural n meningitidis population most of the selected antigens were able to induce cross-protection against heterologous strains demonstrating that these new antigens are good candidates for the clinical development of a vaccine against menb 73 75  it is impressive to notice that within only 18 months the genomic approach allowed the discovery of more potential vaccine candidates than the previous 40 years of conventional research the success of the menb project together with the availability of an increasing number of genomic sequences and the faster and faster development of bioinformatics tools has encouraged the application of the reverse vaccinology approach to many other pathogens nowadays this approach is widely used to develop vaccine candidates against those pathogens for which conventional approaches have failed so far the potential of the genomic approach is so extensive that it could be used not only for bacteria but also for viruses and parasites despite the successes of the conjugate vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae see above the absence of cross protection between the different serotypes with the threat of serotype replacement by strains that are not represented in the vaccine composition makes it unsuitable for universal use 20  to identify more appropriate vaccine candidates the whole genome sequence of s pneumoniae was scanned and 130 potential orfs with significant homology to surface proteins and virulence factors of other bacteria were identified 76  108 of these proteins were effectively expressed in e coli and used to immunize mice six of them were able to confer protection against pneumococcal challenge in a mouse sepsis model flow cytometry confirmed the surface localization of these new proteins furthermore each of the six protective antigens showed a high degree of cross reactivity against the majority of capsular antigens that are expressed in vivo and are immunogenic during human infection providing a good base for the development of improved vaccines against s pneumoniae streptococcus agalactiae or group b streptococcus is the leading cause of bacterial sepsis pneumonia and meningitis in neonates in us and europe 77  as for s pneumoniae the capsular polysaccharide is the major protective antigen but at least nine different seroptypes exist with little or no cross protection 78  therefore a protein-based vaccine is required to overcome serotype differences the complete genome of a serotype v strain of s agalactiae was determined and analyzed 79  the genome is predicted to code for 2175 orfs of which 650 were predicted to be exposed on the surface of the bacteria approximately 350 of these orfs were successfully expressed in e coli and used to immunize mice using the sera in elisa and flow cytometric analysis against intact bacteria it has been demonstrated that 55 of these proteins are in fact measurably expressed on the surface of the bacterium these new antigens are now being evaluated in in vitro and in vivo models for their capacity to protect against invasive infection by group b streptococcus to identify vaccine candidates for staphylococcus aureus an approach based on genomic peptide libraries and well-characterized human sera was developed 80  s aureus peptides were displayed on the surface of e coli via fusion to one or two outer membrane proteins lamb and fhua and probed with sera selected for high antibody titers and opsonic activity the exhaustive screening of the two different peptide expression libraries by the application of macs technology magnetic cell sorting enabled the profile of antigens that are expressed in vivo and that are able to elicit an immune response in humans to be identified a total of 60 antigenic proteins were identified most of which were predicted to be secreted or located on the surface of the bacterium and their antibody-binding sites were mapped these antigens represent promising vaccine candidates for further evaluation a process very similar to the one used to develop a vaccine against menb was used also for porphyromonas gingivalis a pathogen implicated in the etiology of chronic adult periodontitis 81  from a genomic sequence of 2000 genes 120 were selected using a series of bioinformatics tools the selected genes were cloned for expression in e coli and screened by western blotting using sera from human periodontitis patients and animal antisera this subset of 40 recombinant proteins were then purified and used to immunize mice which were subsequently challenged with live bacteria in a subcutaneous abscess model two of these recombinant proteins showing homology to pseudomonas sp oprf protein demonstrated significant protection in the animal model and therefore could represent potential vaccine candidates 82  chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular parasite with a complex biphasic lifecycle an extracellular infectious phase characterized by a spore-like form the elementary bodies eb and an intracellular replicating stage characterized by the reticular bodies rb the pathogen is a common cause of community-acquired acute respiratory infections and more recently has also been associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 83  because of the technical difficulties in working with c pneumoniae and the absence of reliable tools for genetic manipulation not much is known about the cell surface composition of the eb to define the surface protein organization of c pneumoniae a systematic genomic and proteomic approach was used 84  the approach is based on six main experimental steps i in silico analysis of the c pneumoniae genome sequence to identify genes potentially encoding surface proteins including outer and inner membrane and periplasmic proteins ii cloning expression and purification of selected candidates iii use of purified antigens to generate mouse immune sera iv analysis of sera specificity by western blotting of total eb extracts v assessment of antigen localization by facs analysis on whole ebs and vi identification of facs-positive antigens on bidimensional electrophoresis 2de maps of c pneumoniae eb proteins the results of this systematic genome-proteome approach represent the first successful attempt to define surface protein organization of c pneumoniae and raise the possibility to find suitable candidates for a purified vaccine currently licensed anthrax vaccines have been developed during the 1960s and are based on cell-free filtrates containing mainly the protective antigen pa pa is the common cell-binding domain capable of interacting with two different domains the lethal and the edema factors which elicit cell damage these vaccines originally licensed for selected veterinary personnel textile workers and abattoir workers have been widely used for the first time for the us military during the 1990-91 desert storm campaign however this extended use has raised issues and controversies regarding safety efficacy and an unsatisfactory dosing regimen as the vaccine requires 6-dose series of injections and annual boosters 85 86  therefore identification of novel antigens is essential for the development of second-generation b anthracis vaccines orf products similar to proteins involved in bacterial pathogenesis and secreted and surface exposed proteins are the focus of the research using functional genomic analysis 11 candidates were selected in this case a simple method that relied on the in vitro translation of the linear full-length dna of the selected orfs was used polypeptides obtained in vitro were then evaluated for immunogenicity by analysis of their reactivity with hyperimmune anti-b anthracis antisera the combination of bioinformatic genomic analysis and an efficient and fast screening facilitated the identification of unknown antigenic proteins three of which appear to be similar to immunogenic pa these new proteins could represent parts of a second-generation anthrax vaccine 87  old plague vaccines are based on killed whole cell preparations 86 88  although they appeared to be effective against endemic plague they were not considered to be protective against respiratory plague which is the form of most concern in case of biological attack moreover these vaccines have high rates of reactions both systemic and local especially with successive doses and suffer from short duration of protection requiring biannual boosters a live-attenuated vaccine ev76 strain also existed while this vaccine seemed to be effective it retained some virulence and in most countries it was considered not suitable for human use in a search for novel attenuated vaccine candidates for use against y pestis a signature-tagged mutagenesis stm strategy was used 89  a library of tagged mutants of the virulent y pestis kimberley53 strain was generated screening of 300 mutants through two consecutive cycles resulted in selection of 16 mutant strains characterization of the phenotypes and genotypes of the selected mutants led to identification of virulence-associated genes coding for factors involved in global bacterial physiology eg purh purk dnae and grea or for hypothetical polypeptides as well as for the virulence regulator gene lcrf one of the avirulent mutant strains was found to be disrupted in the pcm locus which is presumably involved in the bacterial response to environmental stress this kimberley53pcm mutant was superior to the ev76 live vaccine strain in an animal model in which mice were infected subcutaneously with the virulent y pestis kimberley53 strain either because the mutant induced 10-to 100-fold-higher antibody titers to the protective v and f1 antigens and because it conferred efficacious protective immunity these results indicate that mutants with mutations in the pcm locus can serve as a platform for generation of a novel live vaccine with more promise for inducing efficacious protective immunity to virulent y pestis strains than previously suggested mutants the sars epidemic has been the first infectious disease outbreak to fully benefit from the revolutionary technologies of the post-genomic era thanks to an unprecedented collaboration effort between scientists from many countries coordinated by who and including clinical epidemiological and laboratory investigations within 15 days from the issue of the global alert the causative agent of the new disease was discovered 90  in less than a month after the initial identification of a new coronavirus called sars-cov as the infectious agent of sars two independent genome sequences of the virus had been obtained 91 92  within three months the genome sequences of 20 independent clinical isolates were made available in the genbank database the rapid availability of the genomic sequence of the new virus has been very important from the public health perspective giving prompt answers to a number of critical questions it was clear that the agent was a natural and not a laboratory-fabricated coronavirus diagnostic kits were set up and possible drug and vaccine targets identified today some of these vaccines based on a killed virus are already being tested in pre-clinical and even in clinical trials but their efficacy needs to be shown moreover in addition to the traditional approach a number of newer strategies are being used these include subunit vaccines containing recombinant spike protein expressed in mammalian cells or yeast either alone or in combination with other sars-cov antigens alternatively these antigens could be delivered by dna immunization by non-replicating viruses or viral vectors that are based on adenovirus canarypox modified vaccinia virus ankara mva or alphavirus in particular the development of non-replicating coronavirus-like particles that mimic the structure of native virions could prove promising in the search for a successful vaccine as they display a large repertoire of antigenic sites and discontinuous epitopes 93  it is crucial to remember that none of these approaches would have been possible in such a way and with such a speed without the knowledge of the complete genomic sequence of the virus to make a comparison the last time mankind faced the appearance of a new pandemic was in the early 1980s with the appearance of hiv at that time only 20 years ago it took two years to identify the etiologic agent of the infection and a safe and effective vaccine is still lacking when edward jenner gave birth to the concept of vaccination little could he know that after more than 200 years mankind would still be battling against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases however contemporary society is lucky in that science is constantly offering more effective tools to combat and control infectious diseases the question is whether the many social political cultural and economic barriers that still exist vis--vis vaccines will be eventually overcome thus recognizing the real value of vaccination   a sars dna vaccine induces neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in healthy adults in a phase i clinical trial julie martin e mark louder k lasonji holman

 the first cases of an atypical pneumonia appeared in fosham guangdong province china in november 2002 by february 2003 over 700 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars were reported in the guangdong province of china before it was contained by public health isolation and quarantine measures the epidemic spread to 25 countries over 5 continents and affected 8422 people 1 2 sars infection causes respiratory disease and other organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract are also severely affected the elderly and immunocompromised are more severely affected and suffer greater morbidity and mortality by july 2003 916 deaths had been attributed to the infection by this virus 2 based on serologic data from samples collected prior to the outbreak and retrospectively analyzed up to 40 of individuals working in the animal trade were seropositive but had no history of illness 3 indicating that sars may be either extremely mild or asymptomatic in some cases severe acute respiratory syndrome virus sars-cov is an enveloped rna virus and a member of the coronaviridae family that also includes other human pathogens which typically cause mild upper respiratory infections coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome sars-coronavirus sars-cov was unknown prior to the 2003 outbreak of disease and may be a mutant human coronavirus

glycoprotein s membrane glycoprotein m and envelope e proteins oligomers of the s-glycoprotein form a characteristic spike that protrudes from the membrane 4 5 viral entry into host target cells appears to be mediated by sars-cov spike s glycoprotein and is dependent on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the functional receptor 6 in addition to being responsible for attachment to the cellular receptor s contains epitopes for viral neutralization and t-cell responses 7 studies performed by vrc investigators and colleagues have shown the importance of s-glycoprotein for coronavirus assembly and trafficking 8 other studies have demonstrated neutralization of pseudovirions expressing this protein by serum from convalescent sars patients and the ability of the dna plasmid vaccine described here to induce protective immunity by eliciting cellular and humoral immunity to sars-cov in animal models including the generation of neutralizing antibodies nabs measured in a plaque-reduction assay 8 9 studies performed in beijing china with serum from patients with sars using a neutralization assay against a pseudotyped lentiviral vector bearing the s protein indicated that nabs were first detected 510 days after onset of symptoms peaked at 2030 days and were sustained for more than 150 days 10 the nature of the spread and the severity of illness prompted widespread attempts to identify and understand the disease the cause of sars was determined to be a novel coronavirus and the virus was fully sequenced by may 2003 11 12 rapid identification and sequencing of the virus allowed scientists to begin developing candidate vaccines quickly currently there are no licensed human sars vaccines and only one other vaccine clinical trial has been reported evaluating a whole-inactivated sars vaccine candidate developed by sinovac biotech co ltd in china 13 the current report describes the results of a candidate sars dna vaccine evaluated in a phase i clinical trial in healthy adults initiated within 19 months after the sequence of the virus was initially published the vrc 301 protocol was a phase i open-label study of the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a sars recombinant plasmid dna vaccine encoding sars spike glycoprotein in healthy adult subjects this single-site study was conducted at the vaccine research center vrc national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid national institutes of health nih in bethesda maryland experimental guidelines of the us department of health and human services were followed in the conduct of clinical research and the protocol was approved by the niaid institutional review board ten subjects ages 2149 were enrolled in the study from december 13 2004 through may 2 2005 three injections of vaccine at a dose of 4 mg each were administered on study days 0 28 and 56 at a 4 mg dose in the lateral deltoid muscle via the biojector 2000 needle-free injection management system the dose and route studied in this trial were based on preclinical data and data from clinical trials of vrc dna vaccines for other pathogens 14 15 16 subject safety was monitored by evaluating laboratory and clinical findings and adverse reactions at study visits and adverse events were coded with the medical dictionary for regulatory activities meddra solicited symptoms of local and systemic reactogenicity including pain redness swelling myalgia malaise headache chills nausea and temperature were collected by subject self report on 5-day diary cards following each vaccination subjects were followed for a total of 32 weeks and study visits were completed in december 2005 the vaccine vrc-srsdna015-00-vp is composed of a single closed circular plasmid dna macromolecule vrc-8318 that has been produced in bacterial cell cultures containing a kanamycin selection medium bacterial cell growth is dependent upon the expression of the kanamycin resistance protein encoded by a portion of the plasmid dna following growth of bacterial cells harboring the plasmid the plasmid dna is purified and the vaccine does not contain cellular or viral components the plasmid encodes for a single protein cloned into the expression vector cmvr that has been previously described 17 and evaluated in clinical trials for candidate hiv and ebola dna vaccines 14 16 the plasmid was constructed to produce a deletion mutant of the sars spike glycoprotein urbani strain genbank ay278741 with the cytoplasmic domain truncated scd 9 the vrc-srsdna015-00-vp vaccine is based upon cdna expression of sars spike glycoprotein urbani strain with codon-modification to optimize expression in human cells it expresses the full sequence except for deletion of the last 13 cooh-terminal amino acids vaccine for the clinical trial was prepared under current good manufacturing practice cgmp conditions by vical inc la jolla ca the vaccine met a lot of release specifications prior to administration the dna vaccine was manufactured at a 4 mgml concentration in phosphate-buffered saline pbs vrc plasmid 8318 was expressed in 293 cells and purified for the major protein product duplicate wells of serial dilutions of the volunteer sera were incubated for 2 h at 37 c on sars spike antigen-coatedblocked plates followed by biotin-conjugated antibody 60 min at room temperature streptavidine-horseradish peroxidase 30 min at room temperature and tetramethylbenzidine tmb substrate 10 min at room temperature color development was stopped by addition of 09 m sulfuric acid and plates were read within 30 min at 450 nm on the molecular devices spectramax 384-plus elisa plate reader sunnyvale ca mean optical density od for each dilution was corrected for the mean od of the same dilution of the pre-immunization sample endpoint titers for each volunteer were established as the last dilution with a pre-immunization corrected od 02 subject samples were assessed for the presence of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody by two assays first in a luciferase reporter pseudotyped lentiviral-based assay serial dilutions of sera were incubated with hiv-1 based luciferase reporter virus particles expressing sars spike glycoprotein that were produced in 293 t cells as previously described 18 target cells were human renal adenocarcinoma cell line 786-o obtained from atcc the inhibitory concentration 80 ic80 is reported as a reciprocal dilution and the analysis was performed using previously described methods 19 secondly two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum were assayed in quadruplicate wells of a 96-well plate using a starting dilution of 14 this microneutralization assay measured antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 tcid50 of sars-cov in vero cell monolayers the presence of viral cytopathic effect was read on days 3 and 4 and the dilution of serum that completely prevented cytopathic effect in 50 of the wells was calculated by the reedmuench formula 20 elispot was performed on subject samples at baseline and at weeks 2 6 8 10 12 and 32 as previously described 16 cells were stimulated overnight with vaccine insert specific peptide pools at 2  105 cells per well results are expressed as mean spot-forming cells sfc per million pbmc cd4 and cd8 t-cell responses were measured by ics at baseline and at weeks 2 6 8 10 12 and 32 as previously described 16 cells were stimulated with vaccine insert specific peptide pools cells were permeabilized washed and stained with directly conjugated anti-human cd3 cd4 cd8 ifn- and il-2 antibodies and were assessed for cd3 cd8 cd4 and ifn-il-2 expression on a facscalibur flow cytometer bdis all assays are treated as binary respondersnon-responders we use the usual 95 central exact confidence intervals for binomial rates we are 975 confident that the true response rates in the antibody assays are larger than the lower limit calculations were done in r version 231 a positive t-cell response for ics and elispot data was based on composite criteria as previously described in four published studies of candidate vaccines 14 15 16 sas version 90 sas institute and s-plus version 62 insightful were used for analyses ten healthy adult subjects ages 2149 years mean age 355 were enrolled in the study the subject population consisted of 70 male predominantly white 90 and non-hispaniclatino 80 subjects the mean bmi was 246 range 197339 all subjects had an educational level of college or higher with 30 having an advanced degree the demographic data regarding subject gender age raceethnicity body mass index bmi and educational level at the time of enrollment are shown table 1
 data collected from subject diary cards show that all 10 subjects 100 experienced at least one mild injection site symptom following a vaccination paintenderness swelling and redness with paintenderness at the injection site being the most common complaint five of the ten 50 subjects reported at least one mild systemic symptom myalgia malaise headache chills or fever following vaccination among the solicited symptoms none of the subjects reported nausea none of the subjects reported moderate or severe symptoms following vaccination table 2
 all subjects were followed for 32 weeks for safety and immune response nine of 10 subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule one subject subject g received an oral glucocorticoid to treat poison ivy contact dermatitis after the second vaccination and consequently was withdrawn from the vaccination schedule there were no serious adverse events and there were no grade 3 or 4 severe or life-threatening adverse events overall study vaccinations were well tolerated and found to be safe in healthy subjects ages 2149 years sars spike glycoprotein specific antibody was detected by elisa in 8 of 10 80 of subjects at one or more timepoints table 3
 neutralization was not detected in the microneutralization plaque-reduction assay sars specific neutralizing antibody as assessed by pseudotyped lentiviral vector reporter neutralization assay was detected in 8 of 10 80 of subjects at one or more timepoints fig 1
 the neutralizing antibody response peaked between week 8 and 12 with 6 subjects remaining positive at week 32 pseudovirus neutralization assays are highly sensitive and this is a possible reason for the discrepancy in the results between the two neutralization assays sars spike glycoprotein specific cd4 and cd8 t-cell responses induced by the vaccine were assessed by ics and elispot cd4 t-cell responses to sars cov spike antigen were detected by ics in all subjects 1010 between week 2 and 32 cd8 t-cell responses were detected in 2 of 10 20 of subjects cd4 t-cell responses were of greater frequency and magnitude than cd8 responses fig 2
 cd4 and cd8 t-cell responses as assessed by elispot were detected in 7 of 10 70 of subjects during the course of the trial and all 7 were positive by week 6 2 weeks after the 2nd dose of vaccine the peak t-cell response occurred between week 8 and 12 and when present was sustained throughout the 32-week trial sars represents a recently emergent infectious disease that has caused severe illness global panic and economic disruption the rapid response to the 2003 sars outbreak defines the quintessential response by public health and biomedical communities for a newly emerging infectious disease the ability to quickly identify describe characterize and develop countermeasures including vaccines against future emerging infectious pathogens is critical to maintain public health and economic stability the global response to the sars epidemic provided insight and education for public health experts and scientists which can now be utilized to more optimally respond to future emerging infections including viruses such as avian influenza in response to the 2003 sars infections several laboratories rapidly developed vaccine candidates including the sars candidate dna vaccine described in this report after preclinical evaluation for safety and demonstration of efficacy in a lethal murine challenge model 9 a phase i human trial reported here was initiated within 17 months similar candidate dna vaccines for hiv ebola virus and west nile virus wnv have previously been evaluated as safe and shown to elicit vaccine-induced cellular and humoral immune responses including neutralizing antibody responses to the wnv vaccine 21 like the previously evaluated vrc dna vaccines the sars vaccine induced vaccine-specific t-cell and antibody responses including neutralizing antibody against sars spike glycoprotein in a sensitive pseudotyped lentiviral reporter assay in studies of sars patients antibodies to sars cov spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid proteins are present as assessed by elisa but neutralizing antibody is only elicited by the spike glycoprotein 22 23 24 in this open-label phase i clinical trial the vrc sars dna vaccine was evaluated as safe and well tolerated the vaccine was immunogenic with sars spike glycoprotein-specific t-cell responses induced in all subjects and neutralizing antibody responses detected in 8 of 10 subjects sars spike protein-specific cellular responses were primarily cd4 t cells and a minority of subjects had detectable sars spike protein-specific cd8 t-cell responses the cd8 t-cell response is an important effector mechanism for viral clearance and induction of this population is a goal for gene-based vaccines in prior vrc clinical trials of dna vaccines against hiv ebola and west nile virus vaccine-specific cd4 t-cell responses were detected in nearly all subjects while the frequency of measurable cd8 t-cell responses varied from 7 to 64 14 15 16 21 this aspect of dna vaccine-induced immunity will require additional development an investigational inactivated sars vaccine candidate developed by sinovac biotech co ltd was found to be immunogenic in a phase 1 study conducted in china 13 thirty-six healthy subjects received 2 doses of the inactivated sars-cov vaccine either 16 or 32 sars-cov units or placebo control and all vaccine recipients seroconverted by day 42 post-vaccination the geometric mean titer of nab measured in a plaque-reduction format peaked 2 weeks following the second immunization and decreased after 4 weeks similar to the kinetics observed in the sars dna vaccinated subjects described in this report vaccine-induced cellular immune responses were not reported studies of recovered sars patients have demonstrated long-lived effectorcentral memory t-cell responses to sars s-protein 25 as well as to the other sars viral proteins 26 27 28 and cd8 t cells are thought to play an important role in sars immunity 24 these safety data and immune responses along with data from previously reported trials evaluating similar dna vaccines against other pathogens including ebola wnv and hiv indicate that this sars dna vaccine should be further considered in expanded clinical evaluations for potential future sars outbreaks 14 15 16 21 alone or in prime-boost combination with other vectors the sars dna vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies which are strongly associated with recovery from natural sars infection 13 as well as cellular immune responses that may be an important component of sars immunity the neutralization activity was detected by a sensitive pseudotyped lentiviral assay but not by a less sensitive microneutralization plaque-reduction assay because the sars cov has been contained by careful surveillance and other public health measures licensure of such a vaccine is likely to require use of the animal rule in models that reflect the pathogenesis in humans and the identification and validation of immune correlates this vaccine also demonstrates the feasibility of rapid manufacturing and regulatory review and provides additional safety and immunogenicity data to support the concept of dna vaccination as a potential vaccine platform for future emerging infectious diseases  pandemic influenza threat and preparedness1 anthony fauci s   vaccine development is a critical component of pandemic influenza preparedness in this regard the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid at the national institutes of health nih in april 2005 initiated a phase i clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of different doses of an inactivated h5n1 influenza vaccine manufactured by sanofi pasteur 28 in this study 451 healthy adult volunteers were vaccinated at 3 sites in the united states preliminary evaluation indicates the vaccine is safe and able to stimulate an immune response that may be protective the vaccine is currently being tested in the elderly and testing in children is expected to begin by january 2006 the h5n1 seed virus used to make this vaccine was developed in a matter of weeks through the use of reverse genetics whereas the traditional process of genetic reassortment usually requires a longer period of time and is less predictable 29 additional pilot lots of inactivated vaccine are being produced by another manufacturer chiron corporation and are expected to undergo testing by early 2006 chiron also has produced 40000 doses of an inactivated h9n2 influenza vaccine formulated with and without mf59 adjuvant clinical trials to test the safety and immunogenicity of the inactivated h9n2 vaccine are underway with promising preliminary results in addition the us department of health and human services hhs has awarded several contracts to pharmaceutical companies to produce large quantities of bulk h5n1 vaccine as part of the hhs pandemic influenza preparedness program these contracts are a critical step toward pandemic influenza preparedness because they pave the way for the manufacturer to commence efficient large-scale production of any pandemic vaccine if or when it is needed hhs has also awarded a separate contract to sanofi pasteur to accelerate the development of cell culturebased technologies for influenza vaccine production 28 in addition the intramural research program of niaid has generated live attenuated cold-adapted h9n2 and h5n1 vaccine candidates that have proven protective in mice the h9n2 vaccine candidate has been tested in a phase i clinical trial and data are currently being evaluated clinical evaluation of the h5n1 vaccine is planned for the spring of 2006 live attenuated vaccines are especially promising because they generally trigger more rapid and robust immune responses compared with those induced by inactivated vaccines live attenuated vaccines may also offer more cross-reactivity and therefore greater protection against different variants of the same virus 30 the concept of extending vaccine supplies also is being pursued research has suggested that delivering vaccines intradermally might allow successful immunization with less antigen 3133 clinical trials to compare intramuscular versus intradermal delivery of h5n1 vaccines began in 2005 preliminary safety data showed no adverse effects and immunogenicity data are expected soon studies to assess the effect of alum and mf59 adjuvants on inactivated h5n1 vaccine safety and immunogenicity also are anticipated other research efforts are focused on medications to treat influenza infection unfortunately most currently circulating h5n1 influenza viruses are resistant to 2 inexpensive antiinfluenza drugs rimantadine and amantadine that target the viral m2 protein newer drugs such as oseltamivir phosphate and zanamivir that target the influenza neuraminidase protein appear to be effective against most current h5n1 strains 34 hhs and the centers for disease control and prevention have begun developing a stockpile of antiinfluenza drugs that includes oseltamivir phosphate zanamivir and rimantadine for future use should pandemic influenza occur numerous other projects are under way to identify novel drug targets and develop compounds that inhibit viral entry replication and maturation 28 underpinning these efforts are basic research studies for example niaid coordinates the influenza genome sequencing project a collaborative effort to create complete genetic blueprints of known human and avian influenza viruses as of december 7 2005 a total of 559 influenza genome sequences have been made publicly available in genbank by the niaid project 35 in a separate but related contract awarded to researchers at st jude childrens research hospital animal influenza viruses from wild birds live bird markets and pigs in hong kong and north america are being sequenced and surveillance has expanded to include additional sites in asia the goal of these projects is to rapidly sequence influenza genomes derived from a variety of human and animal sources to enable scientists to understand how the viruses evolve spread and cause disease the long-term goal is improving methods of prevention and treatment as we develop strategies to prepare for an influenza pandemic we need to address the overall fragility of the entire vaccine research and manufacturing enterprise 273637 many pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to enter or remain in the business of manufacturing vaccines unpredictable consumer demands and lack of financial incentives make vaccine manufacturing a risky business in todays marketplace this situation is particularly true with influenza vaccine strong collaborations among government academia and industry are needed to ensure a reliable vaccine supply the biomedical research community can help by developing state-of-the-art technologies and sharing them with industry to streamline the manufacturing process and make it more flexible predictable and able to adapt to the evolving nature of influenza viruses and other pathogens financial and economic incentives including fair pricing and guaranteed purchase of unsold supplies regulatory relief tax incentives liability protection and intellectual property considerations are needed to ensure a steady supply of vaccines 273637 although the fragility of the vaccine industry cannot be fixed overnight the process needs to be initiated now to adequately prepare for future pandemics recent experience with an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars serves as an instructive example in preparing for a potential influenza pandemic 3839 in 2002 the deadly respiratory disease emerged and rapidly spread to canada vietnam hong kong and other sites in china ultimately resulting in 8098 cases and 774 deaths the outbreak which elicited a classic study in epidemiologic investigation with regard to identifying the point source tracking the spread and instituting containment measures taught us many important lessons academic scientists public health officials and commercial pharmaceutical companies acted together in an unprecedented way leading to the development of promising vaccine candidates in record time the etiologic agent of sars a previously unrecognized coronavirus was identified in march 2003 and sequenced within 2 weeks and a vaccine candidate was developed by the following march in december 2004 a clinical trial of a candidate sars vaccine began at the nih vaccine research center 40 because the sars coronavirus is not as easily transmitted as influenza viruses we do not know whether the actions that led to the containment of sars would be as successful if an avian influenza virus acquired the ability to spread efficiently from person to person however we have an added advantage in bracing for pandemic influenza that we did not have with sars as noted sars is caused by a coronavirus that was unknown before the 2003 outbreak in the current situation we have identified the h5n1 virus as a likely candidate for triggering a pandemic we cannot be certain when the next influenza pandemic will emerge or even whether it will be caused by h5n1 or an unrelated virus however we can be certain that an influenza pandemic eventually will occur the efforts currently under way to monitor the evolution and spread of h5n1 and other influenza viruses and to develop candidate vaccines and appropriate countermeasures will help in developing the infrastructure and manufacturing capacity that will be required to scale up vaccine and antiviral production when the pandemic occurs because quantities of vaccine and antiviral drugs against a pandemic influenza virus will be limited deciding beforehand how to best use our resources throughout the world to minimize the impact of pandemic influenza is critical global cooperation will be vital during the sars epidemic the world health organization created an outstanding network of laboratories and public health agencies from countries around the globe that were indispensable in identifying and ultimately containing the spread of the virus to adequately address the many research issues surrounding avian influenza and other potential pandemic pathogens niaids office of clinical research is establishing a southeast asia clinical trials network to evaluate influenza interventions this network builds upon existing infrastructure where possible and will be a true partnership between the investigators and the healthcare leadership of the target countries such international teamwork is essential as we prepare for an influenza pandemic  the challenges of vaccine development against a new virus during a pandemic michael diamond s theodore pierson c   sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus first isolated in wuhan china in december of 2019 from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases zhou et al 2020 sars-cov-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome coronavirus-induced disease-19 covid-19 which is characterized by fever cough and shortness of breath that can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation guan et al 2020 the elderly immunocompromised and those with co-morbid metabolic pulmonary and cardiac conditions are at a markedly greater risk of death from covid-19 virtually all countries and territories have been affected with major epidemics in china italy spain germany france iran and the united states and epicenters in large urban cities most cases are spread by direct human-to-human and droplet contact with a contribution from transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals sars-cov-2 has caused a global pandemic with more than 2400000 infections to date 165000 deaths as of 19 april 2020 and a case-fatality rate estimated at 4 the extensive morbidity mortality and destabilizing social and economic consequences highlight the critical need for the accelerated development of countermeasures rapid implementation and deployment of an effective sars-cov-2 vaccine has the potential to lessen the deleterious effects of infection especially in vulnerable populations curb transmission end the pandemic and prevent its return coronaviruses are round 120-nm-diameter virus particles that derive their name from the incorporation of the viral spike s protein in an arrangement that resembles a crown on the virion surface three additional viral structural proteins envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n together with a lipid membrane and 2531 kilobase viral genome comprise the virion figure 1
a de wit et al 2016 the m and e proteins function during virion morphogenesis and their expression is sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles although their value as immunogens may be limited because they lack the s protein thought to be an important target for neutralizing antibodies interactions between the m glycoprotein and the other three structural proteins coordinate virion assembly the small structural e protein has multiple functions including stimulating the membrane curvature required for virion budding and promoting lipid membrane scission of virions once formed the nucleocapsid protein binds to the viral genome and facilitates its incorporation into the virus particle the s protein exists on virions as homotrimeric spikes that promote coronavirus entry into cells via attachment and membrane fusion de wit et al 2016 in some circumstances the s protein also promotes the formation of syncytia enabling direct cell-to-cell transfer of the viral genome the s protein is a class i viral fusion protein related functionally to the entry-fusion proteins of other well-characterized viruses including influenza hemagglutinin ha hiv-1 gp160 and ebola glycoprotein gp this class of viral fusion proteins characteristically regulates fusogenic activity by proteolytic cleavage accordingly the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s proteins are cleaved sequentially during the entry process to yield s1 and s2 fragments followed by further processing of s2 to yield a smaller s2 protein cleavage also may occur during viral egress the s1 fragment includes the receptor binding domain rbd whereas the carboxyl terminal s2 portion of the molecule contains regions that drive membrane fusion the structure of a soluble stabilized prefusion form of the sars-cov-2 s protein was solved to a resolution of 35 using cryo-electron microscopy revealing considerable similarity to the sars-cov s protein figure 1b wrapp et al 2020 both viruses utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a cellular receptor consistent with the high conservation of the rbd modified mrnas are synthetic molecules optimized for high-level and durable protein expression this technology has shown promise as a vaccine platform for influenza virus nct03076385 and nct03345043 and in preclinical studies with other infectious disease targets including zikv developed by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid in collaboration with moderna mrna-1273 is a lipid-encapsulated modified mrna expressing a prefusion-stabilized s protein the design of the s protein antigen encoded by mrna-1273 was informed by prior structure-guided antigen design studies of the stabilization of class i fusion proteins of mers-cov and other coronaviruses pallesen et al 2017 these studies identified stabilizing proline substitutions in the central helix of s2 that reduced the fusion activity and allowed high-level expression of trimeric s in an antigenically native prefusion context the structure of the stabilized sars-cov-2 antigen encoded by mrna-1273 has been solved figure 1b a phase 1 clinical trial of mrna-1273 nct04283461 was initiated in march of 2020 as an open-label dose-ranging study in 45 subjects who were administered the vaccine in two doses 29 days apart subjects will be followed for 12 months following the second dose for safety with immunogenicity as a secondary objective ino-4800 is a dna plasmid vaccine candidate encoding the sars-cov-2 s protein being developed by inovio pharmaceuticals a similar approach was evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials as a vaccine for mers-cov and was shown to be immunogenic gls-5300 nct02670187 three doses of gls-5300 elicited s-protein-binding antibodies in a majority 94 of vaccinated individuals although neutralizing antibodies were observed less frequently 50 of subjects and titers waned substantially during the course of study follow-up modjarrad et al 2019 vaccine-elicited mers-cov-specific t cell responses also were detectable in most recipients these experiences informed the sars-cov-2 vaccine candidate ino-4800 which is now being evaluated in an open-label phase 1 clinical trial volunteers will receive two doses of dna administered intradermally by electroporation 28 days apart adenovirus ad vectors derived from multiple species have been employed to deliver vaccine antigens for multiple infectious disease targets multiple ad-vectored sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines have been characterized in preclinical models these vaccines elicited both humoral and cellular coronavirus-reactive responses and protected against infection a simian ad vector expressing the mers-cov s protein is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial nct04170829 a phase 12 study to explore the safety immunogenicity and efficacy of a sars-cov-2 vaccine using this platform has been initiated by investigators at the university of oxford nct04324606 a similar approach using the human ad5 serotype is being tested by beijing institute of biotechnology and cansino biologics inc nct04313127 multiple clinical studies are underway to explore the use of bacille calmette-guerin bcg as an immunomodulatory vaccine to protect against covid-19 disease table 1 bcg is a live-attenuated isolate of mycobacterium bovis delivered as a low-cost vaccine to more than 100 million children each year to protect against mycobacterium tuberculosis tb multiple studies in humans and mice suggest bcg administration confers a non-specific protective effect against viral infections moorlag et al 2019 the mechanisms of bcg-mediated cross protections may include enhanced th1 and th17 responses to heterologous antigens and the induction of non-specific memory or trained immunity in innate immune cells capable of producing inflammatory cytokines when challenged secondarily by virus infection despite the expedited design of vaccine candidates against a newly emerging virus in a pandemic setting there remain substantive challenges for implementation due in part to a need to concurrently unravel fundamental aspects of virus biology and immunity along with product development efforts this approach contrasts with vaccine efforts against viruses that have been studied for many years eg influenza dengue denv and respiratory syncytial viruses for which we understand in great detail both the antigenicity of the viral structural proteins and the nature of protective and potentially pathological immune responses while multiple vaccine platforms against sars-cov-2 focus on the s protein questions remain regarding the key elements of a protective immune response 1 will neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection do protective responses require antibody targeting of specific epitopes is there a threshold neutralizing antibody response that protects against sars-cov-2 2 do some of the assays commonly used in vitro to measure neutralization eg pseudotyped viruses faithfully predict protective activity in vivo 3 what is the role of non-neutralizing anti-s antibodies that bind the surface of infected cells could non-neutralizing antibodies promote effector-function-mediated virus clearance via fc--receptor interactions 4 what is the contribution of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract for protection against infection or dissemination 5 are humoral responses to other viral open reading frames orfs important for immunity especially those with immune antagonist activity that are displayed on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly and 6 how important are cd4 and cd8 t cell responses to vaccine-mediated protection while some of this information can be gleaned from pre-clinical and early vaccine trials with sars-cov and mers-cov how certain are we that these correlates of protection will transfer to the pandemic sars-cov-2 the emergence and rapid spread of sars-cov-2 has provided a very short window to address knowledge gaps about coronavirus immunity indeed a major challenge has been the absence of high-throughput small animal disease models to facilitate vaccine candidate down-selection and the detailed study of protective immunity pre-print manuscripts indicate that conventional laboratory strains of mice are not susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection httpsdoiorg10110120200207939389 likely because mouse ace2 cannot act as a cellular receptor for sars-cov-2 letko et al 2020 transgenic mice that express human ace2 hace2-tg develop pneumonia after infection however these mice are not yet widely available for vaccine testing beyond this pathogenesis and immune response evaluation studies in different non-human primate species or other possible animal models eg ferrets and hamsters still are in early stages of development safety is the primary consideration of any vaccine development program given the anticipated administration to large numbers of people beyond the expected reactogenicity profiles studies with other distantly and closely related coronaviruses have raised concerns that humoral vaccine responses might potentiate sars-cov-2 infection via immune enhancement mechanisms immune enhancement might occur via at least two distinct mechanisms detailed below antibody-dependent enhancement ade of infection describes a phenomenon in which poorly neutralizing antibodies bind viruses and increase attachment internalization and infection of myeloid cells expressing fc- or complement receptors ade of denv infection contributes to severe clinical disease in a small fraction of individuals infected for a second time by a heterologous serotype of denv or in newborns that have sub-neutralizing levels of maternal denv-immune igg ade is an obstacle for denv-vaccine development as illustrated by adverse events experienced by denv-naive children that received the licensed tetravalent vaccine dengvaxia through a possibly similar yet undefined mechanism immunization of cats with a vaccinia virus-vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus s protein vaccine resulted in greater rates of death upon challenge of cats with this animal coronavirus vennema et al 1990 in cell culture experiments sars-cov entry and infection were enhanced by some anti-s antibodies through both fc--receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms jaume et al 2011 wan et al 2020 extensive studies with flaviviruses revealed that ade assays in cell culture do not correlate directly with in vivo outcomes as enhancement can be demonstrated in vitro for many viruses for which there is no immune-enhanced disease in vivo this may be explained by the very reductionist format of traditional ade assays that do not integrate features of the immune response known to contribute to immunity the inclusion of complement at physiological concentrations which is omitted from many in vitro assays reduces enhancement in an igg subclass-dependent manner ade has been demonstrated using immunodeficient murine models of denv infection following passive transfer of immune sera but disease severity is reduced considerably in the presence of antiviral t cells coronavirus antibodies that enhance in vitro have not been tested for their ability to exacerbate infection and disease in animals is the infection of fc--receptor-expressing myeloid cells which might be augmented by antibodies an important contributor to covid-19 disease severity studies to address these concepts await the development of appropriate disease models for denv the most compelling evidence for a role of ade in pathogenesis comes from epidemiological studies in humans a second potential mechanism for vaccine-induced disease enhancement results from skewing of the cellular immune response enhanced respiratory disease was observed in the 1960s in some recipients of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine enhanced disease was characterized by lung infiltration by mononuclear cells including eosinophils along with a th2-directed t cell response ruckwardt et al 2019 immune complex deposition after the induction of binding but not neutralizing antibodies has been proposed as an explanation for this response while preclinical studies of multiple sars-cov vaccine candidates demonstrated significant protection from infection a similar th2-driven immunopathogenic response was observed in some instances bolles et al 2011 the structure of the immunogen vaccine formulation including the adjuvant and age of vaccine recipient may influence the immune response and subsequent outcome of natural infection although this remains unclear based on recent progress in rsv vaccine development eliciting a neutralizing antibody response focused on the most protective prefusion s epitopes together with a th1 t cell response may be key features of a safe sars-cov-2 vaccine the development of an effective viral vaccine is a challenge typically guided by decades of basic research on viral biology and the host response to infection this traditional path is not feasible for a rapidly emerging highly virulent pathogen like sars-cov-2 for which a dire need for a vaccine exists although behavioral changes may stem the spread of infections vaccination likely will be required to prevent the establishment of seasonal or additional waves of infection and disease against the backdrop of the many unknowns about coronavirus immunity there is some risk associated with expedited vaccine development during a pandemic however this uncertainty must be balanced by the enormous cost of inaction studies of other pathogenic coronaviruses have enabled the rapid design of candidate sars-cov-2 vaccines provided insight into aspects of immunity that may be important for protection and identified features that merit attention with respect to vaccine safety in this setting carefully designed clinical trials in humans that establish and monitor safety and define correlates and durability of protection may not only result in an effective countermeasure that curtails the pandemic but also provide key mechanistic answers into immune control of sars-cov-2 infection and possibly related highly pathogenic coronaviruses that could emerge in the future  overview of lethal human coronaviruses bin chen er-kang tian bin he lejin tian ruiying han shuangwen wang qianrong xiang shu zhang toufic el arnaout wei cheng   coronaviruses are crown-like particles with spikes protruding from their surface they are enveloped viruses with single-stranded positive-sense rna ssrna genomes of approximately 2632 kb which is currently the largest known genome size for an rna virus1 rna viruses are divided into five branches23 certain groups in a particular branch might be related to andor share features with viruses classified in another branch in branch 1 are the leviviruses and eukaryotic relatives eg mitoviruses narnaviruses ourmiaviruses branch 2 represents several rna virus families of eukaryotes eg orders picornavirales and nidovirales and the families caliciviridae potyviridae astroviridae and solemoviridae and several dsrna viruses eg partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses in branch 3 are certain rna viruses such as the supergroups of alphaviruses and offlaviviruses the nodaviruses tombusviruses and many small and novel groups in branch 4 are dsrna viruses such as the cystoviruses reoviruses and totiviruses branch 5 consists of rna viruses2 coronaviruses were classified as most likely related to branch 2 and belong to the order nidovirales and the family coronaviridae in 2018 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses divided the coronaviridae into the orthocoronavirinae and letovirinae subfamilies according to their host targets coronaviruses can also be divided into animal and human coronaviruses many diseases in domestic animals are related to animal coronaviruses such as canine respiratory coronavirus which causes respiratory disease in dogs4 the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses belong to the subfamily coronavirinae from the family coronaviridae the viruses in this subfamily group into four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus the classic subgroup clusters are labeled 1a1b for the alphacoronaviruses and 2a2d for the betacoronaviruses to date including the recently discovered sars-cov-2 there are seven coronaviruses that infect humans human coronavirus hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 or hcov-hku1 cause only the common cold5 whereas the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov or the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov cause relatively high mortality and emerged in 20026 and 20127 respectively notably sars-cov-2 is currently causing a worldwide epidemic sars-cov and mers-cov belong to subgroups 2b and 2c of the betacoronaviruses respectively18 whereas sars-cov-2 is a new member of the betacoronaviruses distinct from sars-cov and mers-cov9 figure 1 shows the phylogenetic tree of rna viruses the estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses covs are moderate to high compared to those of other ssrna viruses1 there are two gene loci that are sites of variation in sars-cov one of these sites is located in the spike s protein gene the second major site of variation is the accessory gene open reading frame orf8 in mers-cov the major sites of variation are located in the s orf4b and orf3 genes2 the major differences in the sequence of the s gene of sars-cov-2 are three short insertions in the n-terminal domain and changes in four out of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif9 the organizations of the genome and gene expression are similar for all coronaviruses orf1ab located at the 5 end encodes 16 nonstructural proteins nsps named nsp1nsp16 other orfs at the 3 end encode structural proteins including the s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins the mutations in sars-cov-2 have become a hot research topic the surface proteins of sars-cov and batcov-ratg13 the nearest potential bat precursors of sars-cov-2 have 76 and 97 sequence identity respectively to that of sars-cov-210 compared to that of sars-cov the antigenic surface of sars-cov-2 is highly divergent compared to other covs since its outbreak began at the end of 2019 sars-cov-2 has acquired mutations throughout its genome and there are already hundreds of virus strains distributed worldwide according to gisaidorg as of may 8 there were 16004 full genome sequences available and the s clade of the full genome tree contains the largest group of viruses indicating that mutations in orf8-l84s are most frequent the temporal resolution assumes an average nucleotide substitution rate of 5  104 substitutions per site per year based on these mutations researchers found that sars-cov-2 can be divided into two subtypes they reported that the snps at locations 8782 and 28144 show strong linkage the ct haplotype was defined as the l type because t28144 encodes leucine while the tc haplotype was defined as the s type because c28144 encodes serine11 which is in accordance with another study that divided sars-cov-2 into two types12 the l type seems to be more prevalent and aggressive but the s type may be ancestral as sites 8782 and 28144 were identical to the orthologous sites in the most closely related viruses13 patients may be infected by either or both types11 from the gisaid update compared with ratg13 there are differences in the receptor-binding interface which may have favored host switching data related to the sequence and mutations of sars-cov-2 are also available and continuously updated online through the china national center for bioinformation cncb httpsbigdbigaccnncov the first case of sars was discovered in foshan china in november 20026 infections occurred through either direct or indirect contact with patients by july 2003 sars-cov had spread to over 30 countries12 causing 8096 reported cases and 774 deaths after that no additional infections were detected and the sars pandemic was declared over sars-cov was first isolated from himalayan palm civets hpcs from a live-animal market in guangdong china1214 other animals such as raccoon dogs nyctereutes procyonoides along with human workers from the same market also showed evidence of viral infection12 multiple studies have demonstrated that the reservoirs of several coronaviruses including sars-cov-like and mers-cov-like viruses were bats815 although palm civets might have been intermediary hosts of sars-cov16 researchers often concluded there was no evidence that these animals were the ultimate sources of sars-cov and the viruses cannot circulate directly in palm civets in the wild17 in 2003 guan and zhengs team investigated a live-animal retail market in guangdong focusing on recently captured wild animals and human consumption the animals sampled included seven wild and one domestic animal species they collected nasal and fecal samples with swabs and then used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr to test for viral nucleic acid from the n gene of the human sars-cov the rt-pcr assay results showed that samples from four of six hpcs were positive the other seven species beaver chinese ferret-badger chinese hare chinese muntjac domestic cat hog-badger and raccoon dog sampled were negative12 mers-cov was first found in 2012 in a lung sample from a 60-year-old patient who died of respiratory failure in jeddah saudi arabia on 15 september 2012 a similar type of virus named human coronavirus was isolated from a patient with severe respiratory infection cases have also been reported in other countries18 mers has a 35 mortality rate and since it emerged in the human population in june 2012 it has caused substantial morbidity and mortality1920 from 2012 until january 15 2020 the total number of laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection cases reported globally to the world health organization who was 2506 with 862 associated deaths covering 27 countries wwwwhointcsrdon31-january-2020-mers-united-arab-emiratesen cases of mers from other countries were linked to travel to the middle east2021 mers-cov was identified from the saliva of a patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in jeddah ksa mers-cov can be detected in respiratory tract secretions as well as in feces serum and urine2224 in addition it has been isolated from environmental objects such as bedsheets bedrails intravenous fluid hangers and x-ray devices25 in the case of known camel infection mers-cov was transmitted from a camel to a human which was confirmed by rna sequencing26 at the end of december 2019 the first clusters of patients with pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 were reported in wuhan china27 the basic reproduction number of sars-cov-2 is approximately 22 indicating that each patient would on average spread the infection to 22 people28 human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 occurred rapidly and the atypical symptoms during the early stage may be a further disadvantage29 moreover human infection might have begun months prior to the official announcement of the outbreak30 to prevent further spread stricter screening and surveillance are needed at travel hubs31 early detection diagnosis and treatment are also effective measures to contain the epidemic32 nonetheless the fatality rate of sars-cov-2 is lower than that of sars33 with an estimated mortality risk of 234 sars-cov-2 was first isolated from clinical specimens using human airway epithelial cells and the vero e6 and huh-7 cell lines27 approaches to assess virions include isolation from lower respiratory tract specimens35 and artificially infected specific pathogen-free human airway epithelial cells36 fluorescence quantitative pcr with primers designed according to specific sequences and serological testing aimed at igg and igm can be used to detect the virus9 sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 pose major challenges to global health causing infections in large parts of the world sars-cov was found in 30 countries and mers-cov in 27 countries while sars-cov-2 was found in 213 countries by 8th may 2020 details on the pandemics caused by sars-cov-2 are shown in box 1 highlighting the status of the coronavirus-caused diseases worldwide the clinical manifestations of sars include hypoxia cyanosis high fever above 38 c accelerated breathing or respiratory distress syndrome and shortness of breath x-rays show changes to the lungs to varying degrees the who case definition 2003 includes the following 1 fever higher than 38 c or history of such in the past 2 days 2 radiological evidence of new infiltrates consistent with pneumonia 3 chills cough malaise myalgia or known history of exposure and 4 positive test for sars-cov by one or more assays37 similar to sars-cov infection mers-cov infection manifests as a severe lower respiratory tract infection with extrapulmonary involvement and high fatality rates19 symptomatic patients may present fever chills stiffness myalgia discomfort cough shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea vomiting and abdominal pain pneumonia is common and severe infection with acute respiratory failure renal failure and shock is particularly frequent among older patients20 previous studies have estimated that approximately 12525 of mers-cov infections may be asymptomatic2038 it must be noted that immunocompromised people are at high risk of mers-cov infection21 for covid-19 fever cough myalgia and fatigue are most commonly observed at illness onset less commonly observed are sputum production hemoptysis and headache among others2935 similar to sars and mers some patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards39 around 81 of infected patients only develop mild symptoms with mild pneumonia or no pneumonia 14 and 5 are severe and critical status respectively40 patients requiring icu care tend to be much older and are more likely to have underlying comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes29 additionally symptoms such as pharyngeal pain and anorexia are reported at higher rates among those admitted to the icu than among non-icu patients29 histopathologically symptoms such as diffuse alveolar damage dad loss of cilia squamous metaplasia denudation of bronchial epithelia and giant-cell infiltrate often occur in the lungs of patients with sars the number of macrophages increases prominently in the alveoli and the interstitium41 according to the morphological changes observed most authors have subclassified lung lesions in sars into two or three consecutive phases an acute exudative inflammatory phase a fibrous proliferative phase and a final fibrotic stage although there is considerable overlap in histological findings among these phases42 the main features of the first phase include extensive hyaline membrane formation edema alveolar hemorrhage and fibrin exudation in alveolar spaces the second phase includes widening of septae pneumocyte hyperplasia and organizing fibromyxoid and cellular exudates4243 the third phase includes septal and alveolar fibrosis42 several autopsies of sars patients have demonstrated secondary bronchopneumonia and the pathogens identified mainly consist of staphylococcus aureus mucor sp aspergillus sp pseudomonas aeruginosa and cytomegalovirus43 sars-cov also greatly affects the immune system for example hemorrhagic necrosis is usually obvious in the lymph nodes and spleen44 as described above sars-cov attacks immune cells especially t cells and macrophages with approximately 50 of lymphocytes and 30 of monocytes in the circulation becoming infected4245 under the influence of the virus the patients germinal centers disappear and both t and b lymphocytes are depleted in the spleen the white pulp shrinks hemorrhage and necrosis occur in the red pulp and the periarterial lymphatic sheaths decrease424546 with regard to the immune system sars-cov can infect the lymphoid component of the intestine for this reason the patients submucosal lymphoid tissue atrophies47 sars-cov can also infect epithelial cells in the mucosa of the small and large intestines and the digestive tract may undergo mild diffuse inflammation and atrophy of the submucosal lymphoid tissues47 according to previous reports symptoms in the liver include extensive hepatocyte mitosis balloon degeneration of hepatocytes mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltrates fatty degeneration and central lobular necrosis42 additionally apoptosis of liver cells has been confirmed in some cases48 on autopsy the kidneys of some sars patients showed focal bleeding and acute tubular necrosis of different degrees one of the major complications of ards is acute kidney injury424950 in many other cases the features are nonspecific including benign hypertensive nephrosclerosis and autolysis42 moreover researchers have detected viral particles and genome sequences in the cytoplasm of neurons of the hypothalamus and cortex in the brain51 which suggests that the virus can cross the bloodbrain barrier and cause degeneration and necrosis of neurons edema extensive glial cell hyperplasia and cellular infiltration42 pneumocytes and epithelial syncytial cells are important targets of mers-cov the lung tissue presents dad severe peripheral vascular diseases patchy cardiac fibrosis and hepatic steatosis have also been found in other organs52 another symptom is bronchial submucosal gland necrosis52 renal biopsy may show acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute tubulosclerosis with protein casts22 in covid-19 patients a bilateral sometimes unilateral distribution of patchy shadows and ground glass opacity in the lungs is typical based on ct scans29 plasma concentrations of interleukins ils 2 7 and 10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor interferonifn--inducible protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and tumor necrosis factor  are increased in most dying patients3953 in addition neutrophilia related to cytokine storms induced by virus invasion coagulation activation related to a sustained inflammatory response and acute kidney injury related to the effects of the virus hypoxia and shock may be involved in mortality29 those who survive intensive care may experience long-term lung damage and fibrosis due to aberrant and excessive immune responses39 moreover researchers found that as sars-cov-2 spread and changed across generations clinical symptoms started to differentiate those infected previously from those infected more recently the initial symptoms are becoming more insidious which indicates that the virus may gradually evolve into an influenza-like virus and lie dormant for longer in asymptomatic patients54 in conclusion in terms of outbreak times sars-cov was the earliest followed by mers-cov then sars-cov-2 to date mers-cov has the longest duration of infection and sars-cov-2 appears to be the most infectious sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections have similar symptoms including fever cough myalgia and shortness of breath among others the common transmission methods and symptoms of the three coronavirus infection are shown in fig 2 sars-cov is a coronavirus with a diameter of approximately 100 nm coronaviruses are the largest ssrna viruses and contain at least 14 orfs1655 among which five main orfs encode the replicase rep and the s e m and n proteins56 similar to other coronaviruses there is a wide array of spike proteins on the envelope of sars-cov that resemble a corona with its unique rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp sars-cov often switches template strands during replication thus if a cell is infected with several coronaviruses rna recombination may occur the n protein combines with viral rna to form a nucleocapsid which is involved in the replication of sars-cov and is the most abundant protein in virus-infected cells5657 the m protein is a membrane glycoprotein that is involved in budding and envelope formation the s protein of sars-cov is a type i transmembrane tm glycoprotein that is responsible for viral binding fusion and entry into cells as well as antibody induction1658 the s protein contains a signal peptide sp amino acids 112 and three domains called the extracellular domain amino acids 131193 the tm domain amino acids 11941215 and the intracellular region amino acids 1216125516 the extracellular domain consists of two subunits s1 and s2 the fragment located in the middle region of the s1 subunit amino acids 318510 is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor-binding region the s2 subunit comprises a fusion peptide fp and two x 7-valent element repeats hr1 and hr2 that are responsible for fusion between the virus and the target cell membrane58 thus the s protein may be key to develop a vaccine to generate antibodies and block virus binding and fusion in the coronaviruses fig 3 the 3 end of the sars virus genome encodes 12 structural proteins and helper proteins of which orf3a orf6 orf7a and orf7b have been proven to be viral structural proteins involved in the formation of viral particles the 5 end of the genome encodes 16 nonstructural proteins nsps which are important for virus assembly and may enable the design of small molecule drugs andor vaccines mers-cov belongs to lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus cov in the family coronaviridae order nidovirales and it is the first lineage c cov and the sixth cov known to cause human infection mers-cov is an enveloped ssrna virus similar to other covs but the amino acid sequence homology between mers-cov and other known covs is less than 9019 orf1a and orf1b located in the first two-thirds of the mers-cov genome are involved in virulence and encode nsps nsp116 the remaining third of the genome encodes four structural proteins the s e m and n proteins as well as five accessory proteins orf3 orf4a orf4b orf5 and orf8b5961 the flanking regions of the genome contain the 5 and 3 untranslated regions utrs62 most mers-cov proteins are found in the cytoplasm63 to date the ns4b protein and the orf3a-encoded protein are the only known coronavirus proteins to be detected in the nucleus64 nsp1 suppresses host gene expression in infected cells and its rna cleavage-inducing function promotes virus assemblybudding65 nsp16 is a viral 2-o-methyltransferase 2-o-mtase that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection suggesting that nsp16 is a conserved universal candidate for rapid design of a live attenuated vaccine66 orf4as protein can mask viral dsrna to play a role in immune evasion including type 1 ifn and protein kinase r-mediated antiviral stress responses67 mers-cov nsp13 is a full-length coronavirus helicase that contains multiple domains including an n-terminal cyshis rich domain with three zinc atoms a beta-barrel domain and a c-terminal superfamily sf 1 helicase sf1 core with two reca-like subdomains this protein might interfere with the nonsense-mediated mrna decay pathway to avoid degradation of viral rna68 the mers-cov s protein can recognize dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 on the cell surface promoting the fusion of the viral envelope and the cell membrane the mers-cov s protein a 1353-amino acid type i tm glycoprotein located on the viral envelope surface is composed of s1 and s2 subunits69 the structure of the s protein consists of four parts an sp located at the n terminus amino acids 112 an extracellular domain amino acids 131195 a tm domain amino acids 11961215 and an intracellular domain amino acids 1216125516 the s1 subunit contains two independent domains an n-terminal domain ntd amino acids 1835370 and a c-terminal domain amino acids 367588 both of which may function as receptor-binding domains rbds71 these domains serve as critical targets for the development of vaccines and therapeutics7273 and facilitate the involvement of the s1 subunit in cell receptor dpp4 binding the core structure of the mers-cov s protein rbd is a five-stranded antiparallel sheet with several short helices in which three disulfide bonds stabilize the core by connecting c383 to c407 c425 to c478 and c437 to c5851673 the accessory subdomain of the c-domain is a hypervariable region for receptor recognition and is called the receptor-binding motif rbm the accessory subdomains in sars-cov and mers-cov differ resulting from divergent evolution and leading to the use of different receptors71 dpp4 consists of an n-terminal hydrolase and a c-terminal -propeller domain composed of eight lancets74 and the rbd the s2 subunit of mers-cov contains an fp residues 943982 an hr1 domain residues 9841104 an hr2 domain residues 12461295 a tm domain residues 12961317 and an intracellular domain residues 1318135369 the s2 subunit is responsible for fusion between the virus and the target cell membrane after the s1 subunit binds to dpp4 the s2 subunit inserts its fp into the target cell membrane to change its conformation its hr1 helix then forms a homotrimer with an exposed surface that has three highly conserved hydrophobic grooves and binds with hr2 to form a six-helix bundle 6-hb core structure which facilitates fusion by bringing the viral and cell membranes into close proximity69 the genetic material of mers-cov then enters the host cell via the fusion pore69 sars-cov-2 which causes covid-19 is a spherical betacoronavirus with a diameter of 60140 nm and unique spikes ranging from 9 to 12 nm27 its rna has the typical betacoronavirus organization containing a 5 utr a gene encoding the replicase complex orf1ab the s gene e gene m gene and n gene a 3 utr and several unidentified nonstructural orfs2775 the length of the sequences is 265 nt for the 5 terminal region 229 nt for the 3 terminal region 3822 nt for the s gene 228 nt for the e gene 669 nt for the m gene and 1260 nt for the n gene75 the 21291-nt-long orf1ab gene contains 16 predicted nsps75 similar to sars-cov there is a predicted orf8 gene that is 366 nt in length and located between the m and n orf genes75 nucleotides 1 1029 and 1652 may be the recombination breakpoints because based on the fragments from nt 1 to nt 1029 and nt 1652 to the end sars-cov-2 seems to be related to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 however when considering the region from nt 1030 to nt 1651 sars-cov-2 is mostly likely to be grouped with sars-cov and bat sars-like covs more research is required to analyze the recombination of the genome as a whole75 with over 10 of its conserved replicase complex being different from those of other betacoronaviruses sars-cov-2 solely occupies a newly created subclade within the sarbecovirus subgenus2775 bats may be its natural host but owing to several arguments including the complicated environment in the wet markets in wuhan this remains unclear and further research is needed367577 the free energy of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is much lower than that of sars-cov indicating that sars-cov-2 is more stable than sars-cov78 the high similarity of the rbd sequences and of the spike protein structures between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov367579 also the simulation of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 binding to ace280 the receptor of sars-cov and results shown that ace2 plays a vital role in sars-cov-2 entry into hela cells76 indicating that sars-cov-2 also uses ace2 for cell entry structural modeling of the ace2-b0at1 complex b0at1 is used to obtain stable ace2 suggests that the complex can bind two s proteins simultaneously providing important clues to the molecular basis of coronavirus recognition and infection81 the rbd-ace2 binding free energy for sars-cov-2 is significantly lower than that for sars-cov in accordance with the fact that sars-cov-2 is more infectious than sars-cov78 a recent study found that cd147 a kind of tm glycoprotein facilitates cell entry of sars-cov-2 functionally and its affinity constant with the s protein is 185  107 m82 table 1 shows a comparison of the structures of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 the specific function of the sars-cov-2 proteins including s e m and n proteins need further study in conclusion sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are similar in structure their major proteins are structural proteins including the s e m and n proteins accessory protein and nsps nsp116 all these viruses rely on the s protein to identify cell targets and fuse with membranes their s proteins are composed of s1 and s2 subunits the s1 subunit contains an ntd and a c-domain in which there is an rbd the accessory subdomain of the c-domain is a hypervariable region for receptor recognition and is called the rbm the difference is that sars-cov recognizes ace2 sars-cov-2 recognizes ace2 and cd147 but mers recognizes dpp4 which results from the difference between the accessory subdomains of sars-cov sars-cov-2 and mers-cov the function of the accessory and nonstructural proteins of these three viruses is related to viral replication and assembly hence linked to virulence sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are nearly identical in terms of invasion and self-replication whereas mers-cov has different targets the cellular receptor of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is ace2 plus cd147 for sars-cov-2 while that of mers-cov is dpp4 the human ace2 protein is a typical zinc metallopeptidase that comprises 805 amino acids and contains a single catalytic domain it is a type i integral membrane glycoprotein that is oriented with an extracellular n terminus and a catalytic site that functions in metabolizing circulating peptides83 it is believed that there is a virus-binding hot spot on ace2 that is not pre-existent or preorganized but is induced to form upon virus binding84 the hot spot consists of a salt bridge surrounded by hydrophobic tunnel walls the general structural features of the hot spot favor virus binding it is located in a region on ace2 that is furthest from the membrane relatively flat and free of glycosylation and is thereby easily accessible to viruses the hot spot is mainly an intrinsic property of ace2 but it is also a dynamic structure and receives structural contributions from both ace2 and the viruses with the contributions of ace2 being more pronounced dpp4 is a type ii transmembrane glycoprotein that consists of approximately 766 amino acids dpp4 contains an n-terminal hydrolase and a c-terminal -propeller domain composed of eight lancets74 the s protein rbd binds to the side surface of the dpp4 propeller and the amino acid residues in lancets 4 and 5 including k267 q286 t288 r317 r336 q344 a291 l294 and i29574 the pathogenic mechanism of sars-cov is believed to include two parts the virus injures target cells directly and subsequent immune system dysfunction leads to indirect injury42 sars-cov spreads via droplet and contact transmission and via the fecaloral route through droplet inhalation the virus enters the respiratory tract and invades epithelial cells infection and replication of the virus and local inflammatory changes contribute to lung tissue damage subsequently sars-cov infects circulating and resident immune cells the key cells in this step consist mainly of t cells and macrophages the viruses are then carried to other organs including secondary lymphoid organs by these circulating immune cells42 sars-cov resembles hiv because both viruses attack immune cells and cause immunodeficiency42 sars-cov causes lung injury mainly by inhibiting the function of ace2 the virus binds to ace2 via the spike protein downregulating its function and contributing to lung injury ace2 is an important component of the reninangiotensin system ras in this system angiotensinogen is first converted to angiotensini angi by renin and then angiis converted to ang ii under the influence of ace2 ace2 downregulates the levels of angi and ang ii which can bind to the ang ii type i at1 receptor and cause certain types of lung injury mainly pulmonary hypertension pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury85 ang ii can directly induce pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells to grow or proliferate rapidly through at1 thus causing pulmonary hypertension86 ang ii contributes to pulmonary fibrosis by promoting the expression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-b1 causing fibroblasts to convert to myofibroblasts and accumulate collagen70 several strategies can be used by the virus to escape the innate immune response normally viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps are detected by host pattern recognition receptors prrs pamps include viral dsrna and mrna and prrs include retinoic acid-inducible gene i protein rig-i and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 mda5 production of type i ifn is induced via the nuclear factor-b nf-b pathway when ifn binds to the ifn receptor signal transducer and activator of transcription stat proteins are activated which increases the production of other antiviral proteins and thus blocks sars-cov replication for further infection11 additionally sars-cov could encode several proteins that hinder the signaling cascades downstream of prrs the cell receptor of mers-cov is dpp4 which is widely expressed on epithelial cells in the prostate alveoli kidneys liver and small intestine and on activated leukocytes thus the range of mers-cov tissue tropism is broader than that of any other similar coronavirus mers-cov infection of dendritic cells and macrophages can lead to the continuous production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tnf- il-6 cxcl-10 ccl-2 ccl-3 ccl-5 and il-887 compared to sars-cov infection mers-cov infection can cause higher expression levels of il-12 ifn- ip-10cxcl-10 mcp-1ccl-2 mip-1ccl-3 rantesccl-5 and il-887 induction of immune cell-recruiting cytokineschemokines might lead to the infiltration of a large number of immune cells into the lower respiratory tract causing severe inflammation and tissue damage87 mers-cov can also infect t cells and lead to apoptosis avoiding the host immune response and facilitating faster spread88 mers-cov has also evolved a mechanism to escape the host cell immune system when host sensors initiate signaling pathways transcription of type i ifn genes begins and the type i ifn response which is an essential component of antiviral innate immunity is initiated8991 ifn activates the transcription of numerous ifn-stimulated genes isgs and synthesizes 25-oligoadenylate 2-5a which causes rnase l activation9193 activated rnase l can cleave both viral and host ssrna leading to translation stagnation and apoptosis and limiting virus replication and transmission in vitro and in vivo9294 however the mers-cov protein ns4b has phosphodiesterase activity and antagonizes rnase l via enzymatic degradation leading to inference with ifn signaling although ns4b is mainly expressed in the nucleus the expression level of the ns4b protein in the cytoplasm is sufficient to prevent activation of rnase l88 in addition the mers-cov m orf4a orf4b and orf5 proteins are reported to be strong ifn antagonists among which the orf4a orf4b and orf5 proteins inhibit both type i ifn induction619596 and nf-b signaling pathways which are similar to the type i ifn signaling pathway96 providing a possible mechanism for mers-cov evasion of innate immunity8896 for sars-cov-2 the first cluster of patients was believed to be associated with a seafood market27 however due to the identification of patients without direct exposure to the market transmission between humans was proven97 hospital-related transmission has also been detected via infected medical workers and hospitalized patients main routes of transmission include respiratory droplets close contact and extended exposure to aerosol environments loaded with high concentrations of virions in addition to transmission through the respiratory tract exposure of unprotected eyes to sars-cov-2 might cause acute respiratory infection98 notably the virus can be transmitted during the incubation period99 the tm protease serine type 2 tmprss2 primes the s protein of sars-cov-2 for cell entry100 based on analysis of the ace2 rna expression profile in normal human lungs sars-cov-2 mainly infects type ii alveolar at2 cells only 064 of human lung cells can express ace2 83 of which are at2 cells and they express many other genes that facilitate sars-cov-2 infection101 moreover cd147 was also reported that it probably functionally facilitates cell entry of sars-cov-282 high expression of ace2 has also been detected in cells of the digestive system such as upper esophageal cells accordingly this system is a potential route of infection102 in addition to the lungs and intestines other organs such as the heart esophagus kidney bladder testis ileum and adipose tissue also express ace2 and the expression level is higher than that in the lungs103104 certain tumor tissues have higher expression of ace2 making cancer patients more vulnerable than other people104 in conclusion sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind cells expressing ace2 they affect the ras system due to the affinity for ace2 much stronger with sars-cov-2 than with sars-cov leading to the onset of symptoms mers-cov causes symptoms by producing inflammatory cytokines and invading t cells the specific pathogenic mechanisms of these three viruses are illustrated in fig 4 in addition to clinical manifestations definitive diagnosis and confirmation of a coronavirus infection requires specific testing the criteria for the diagnosis of sars from the who include 1 fever higher than 38 c or history of such in the past 2 days 2 radiological evidence of new infiltrates consistent with pneumonia 3 chills cough malaise myalgia or known history of exposure and 4 positive tests for by at least one assay as for mers the criteria for the diagnosis according to the who include 1 fever cough and hospitalization with suspicion of lower respiratory tract lesion 2 history of contact with probable or confirmed cases 3 history of travel or residence within the arabian peninsula and 4 positive tests by a pcr-based detection method using respiratory samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs nasopharyngeal or tracheal aspirates bronchoalveolar lavage bal and induced sputum or by serological tests such as the rapid immunochromatographic assay using highly selective monoclonal antibodies at room temperature the initial criteria for the diagnosis of sars included 1 a history of travel or residence in wuhan within 2 weeks before the onset of illness 2 exposure to patients from wuhan with fever and respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks before the onset of illness or the existence of clusters of diseases 3 fever accompanied by radiographic features of pneumonia a normal or decreased total number of white blood cells or a decreased lymphocyte count and 4 fluorescence pcr testing positive for nucleic acids of sars-cov-23759105107 early diagnosis of mers is difficult but several highly specific and sensitive molecular and serologic assays exist for diagnosis in both animals and humans108 among them a rapid immunochromatographic assay can detect mers-cov antigens based on the detection of the mers-cov nucleocapsid protein in a short time frame the relative sensitivity and specificity of this test are 939 and 100 respectively105 nucleic acid tests such as real-time pcr tests were mostly used to detect virus in the early stage of the outbreak of sars-cov-2 although this approach requires a relatively long time and is not conducive to accelerating diagnosis or large-scale application therefore alternative rapid diagnostic kits for sars-cov-2 may be used for example the colloidal gold detection kit uses serum plasma or whole blood samples to detect igmigg antibodies for diagnosis on the 7th day of infection or the 3rd day after onset and requires only 15 min the nucleic acid detection kit for six respiratory viruses including sars-cov-2 and influenza a virus uses thermostatic amplifier chips for diagnosis by detecting different infections it may help distinguish people with influenza from those with other viral infections a newly developed detection method nanopore targeted sequencing also has the potential for efficiently detecting viruses in a reasonable time moreover it could identify 40 other respiratory viruses and monitor changes in virulence and transmissibility caused by viral mutations109 all patients should be treated in isolation53 based on previous studies drugs may be developed to inhibit cell entry several strategies have been investigated to identify specific antivirals targeting the s protein including mers-rbd-targeted nabs that block viral attachment peptide inhibitors targeting s2 to prevent the formation of the fusion core and small molecules without defined mechanisms110 sdpp4 has been found to bind mers-cov rbd with high affinity suggesting that sdpp4 could serve as a blocker for mers-cov attachment to and entry into cells111112 one study reported a monoclonal antibody 7d10 that binds to the ntd to inhibit cellular entry of mers-cov113 experiments have shown that 7d10 not only inhibits the binding of mers-cov to cells but also has effects after viral-cell attachment 7d10 inhibits virus invasion by blocking the binding of the s1 subunit to the receptor and interfering with the conformational transformation of the s2 subunit when the virus fuses with the cell membrane113 a peptide fragment spanning residues 736761 of the s protein exerts neutralization activity by inhibiting membrane fusion and the entry of mers-cov suggesting that it is possible to develop vaccines targeting this neutralizing epitope114 griffithsin a lectin derived from red algae binds to oligosaccharides on the surface of sars-cov s protein and may also prove effective against sars-cov-234115 researchers found that antibodies raised against sars-cov such as css-2 -3 -4 and -5 could cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 by reducing s-driven cell entry although the efficiency was lower than that observed for sars-cov100 meplazumab an anti-cd147 humanized antibody binds with the cd147 in competition with the s protein116 thus significantly inhibiting virus from invading cells and reducing the time of negative conversion82106 chloroquine could effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro and hydroxychloroquine was even more potent than chloroquine117118 hydroxychloroquine could significantly help reduce the virus load and azithromycin could reinforce its effect119 arbidol could also contribute to condition improvement120 note that these studies were generally limited and further trials and development are necessary protease inhibitors also have the potential for coronavirus therapeutics protease inhibitors including disulfiram lopinavir and ritonavir have been reported to be effective against sars and mers and disulfiram a drug for alcohol dependence was reported to inhibit the papain-like protease plpro of mers-cov and sars-cov in cell cultures34108 in vitro sars-cov can be inhibited by both 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine targeting plpro121 when used together with ribavirin the protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir have improved the outcomes of patients with sars compared with those achieved with the use of ribavirin alone122 such inhibitors are also being tested in patients infected with sars-cov-2 but whether these inhibitors effectively suppress 3clpro and plpro of sars-cov-2 remains controversial34 drugs such as colistin valrubicin icatibant bepotastine epirubicin epoprostenol vapreotide aprepitant caspofungin perphenazine prulifloxacin bictegravir nelfinavir and tegobuvir bind to the main protease of sars-cov-2 and thus are potential candidates123 lianhua-qingwen formula a kind of traditional chinese medicine has been also recently described theoretically as a potential treatment candidate against the main virus protease124 the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate could partly block sars-cov-2 infection of lung cells by inhibiting tmprss2100 viral rna synthesis blockers also have potential remdesivir has broad-spectrum activity against mers-cov and sars-cov in cell cultures and animal models and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of ebola virus disease34125 it was also reported positively based on a patient with sars-cov-2 infection in the us126 and another study showed that it was able to inhibit the virus117 ribavirin is often used to treat sars and mers but it is uncertain whether it is potent enough against covid-1934108 regardless when used alone ribavirin has minimal activity against sars-cov and may cause strong side effects it is often used together with corticosteroids14127 a preclinical study of galidesivir bcx4430 an adenosine analog revealed antiviral activity against sars-cov and mers-covcov115 a study of favipiravir t-705 a guanine analog proved its activity against sars-cov-2 and randomized trials of favipiravir plus interferon- chictr2000029600 and favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil chictr2000029544 are in progress34 corticosteroids may be used to treat sars patients to suppress lung inflammation although this therapy is not associated with mortality in patients with mers it is associated with delayed clearance of mers-cov rna14128 moreover clinical evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids for covid-19 treatment129 regarding antibodies plasma therapy using convalescent plasma from fully recovered patients is effective against these coronaviruses including sars-cov-2108130 tocilizumab anti-human il-6 receptor may curb immunopathology and trials are ongoing now131 a study of novel monoclonal antibodies against the mers-cov spike protein suggests that mabs can be utilized for the identification of specific mutations of mers-cov132 wang et al provided an all-hydrocarbon-stapled peptide that likely mimics the native conformation of the c-terminal short -helical region of the mers-cov s protein which can block the formation of the hexameric coiled-coil fusion complex to inhibit viral-cell membrane fusion133134 current treatments for sars mainly include ribavirin ifn  plasma therapy host-directed therapies and systemic corticosteroids1441 due to the lack of clinical trial data adequate supportive care supplemented with different combinations of drugs remains the main treatment for patients1441 for mers despite many studies in humans there is no consensus on the best treatment thus randomized clinical trials are needed to assess potential treatment options134 several therapeutics are in development including convalescent plasma lopinavirritonavir ribavirin ifn and novel therapies including polyclonal antibodies and broad-spectrum antivirals108 antimicrobial peptides amps may be used as alternative therapeutic agents135 and many have been effective even against bacterial proteases agents136 antiviral drugs with effective activity in vitro include neutralizing monoclonal antibodies antiviral peptides mycophenolic acid lopinavir ifn ribavirin nitazoxamide mycophenolate mofetil mmf alisporivir silvestro and corticosteroids192159 although there is no agreement on the most ideal treatment option to cure covid-19 much research activities and pursued routes are underway the host-directed strategy is another approach for limiting viral replication host proteases such as cathepsin b and cathepsin l can cleave the spike protein of sars-cov drugs such as camostat inhibit host serine proteases and then interfere with the entry of sars-cov but they may cause many significant side effects14135 pegylated ifn -2a and -2b may be used to stimulate innate antiviral responses in patients and chloroquine an approved immune modulator was reported to have inhibitory effects against sars-cov-2 under certain conditions34 researchers have also proposed that some commercially available drugs with suitable safety profiles such as metformin glitazones fibrates sartans and atorvastin as well as nutrient supplements and biologics might reduce immunopathology boost immune responses and prevent or curb ards in addition ongoing cellular therapies using mesenchymal stromal cells from allogeneic donors have been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and are being evaluated in phase 12 trials in patients with ards these therapies may be assayed in sars-cov-2-infected patients40137138 expansion of antiviral t cells as cellular drugs could aid in preparing t cell products for adjunct treatment of patients with severe infection40 overall there are similarities and differences among the treatments for these three coronaviruses notably we summarize the potential drugs and vaccines in table 2 vaccination could be used to prevent infection or to reduce disease severity different kinds of vaccines such as dna vaccines recombinant proteins subunit vaccines and inactivated viruses were described14 however the highly sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms of viral pathogens and their high mutation rates make human vaccine development a major challenge136 the four nsps 3clpro plpro helicase and rdrp which are key enzymes in the viral life cycle and the s protein which is responsible for receptor binding during cell entry are attractive targets for developing vaccines against coronaviruses115 among them the s protein is most commonly targeted61 based on previous studies it is believed that the s protein receptor-binding domain s-rbd located in the s1 subunit is an important target for the development of a sars vaccine especially the key neutralizing region cnd indeed cnd can induce a strong neutralizing antibody response and cross-protection against sars-cov mutants one study showed that a recombinant fusion protein designated rbd-fc containing the 193-amino acid rbd and a human igg1 fc fragment can induce highly potent antibody responses in immunized rabbits the antibodies inhibited sars-cov infection serum dilution of 110240 and they are believed to be safer than other types of vaccines139 additionally with chloroplast transgenic technology it is possible to combine the fusion gene s-rbd and the carrier molecule cholera toxin b subunit into the tobacco chloroplast genome to obtain a chloroplast transgenic tobacco plant that stably expresses the oral sars-cov subunit vaccine140 for mers vaccines based on the viral s protein include full-length s or s-trimer protein-based vaccines such as a full-length s-based simian adenovirus vector vaccine chadox1 and dna vaccine gls-530061 s1-based vaccines such as an ad vector encoding mers-cov s1 extracellular domain ad5mers-s1 and an rabv vector encoding an s1-elicited antibody141142 rbd-based vaccines and vaccines based on other regions it has been confirmed that the s proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are quite similar but researchers recently found that the three monoclonal antibodies developed to bind to the s protein of sars-cov s230 m396 and 80r do not cross-react with the s protein rbd of sars-cov-2 suggesting that tailored vaccines and antibodies against sars-cov-2 must be designed143 dna vaccines are also quite promising specific igg antibodies against sars-cov can be promoted by the s gene dna vaccine as mentioned above the s protein of sars-cov plays an important role during the pathogenic process and synthetic peptides induced by dna vaccine in escherichia coli elicit specific antibodies against the sars-cov s protein which might provide another approach for further developing sars-cov vaccines42144 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a plasmid dna vaccine gls-5300 that expresses the s protein of mers-cov a phase i clinical trial on healthy volunteers was conducted in 2016 but the results were not reported another phase i trial utilizing the viral vector chimpanzee adenovirus oxford university 1 chadox1 containing the mers-cov s protein expression gene was started by oxford university in january 2018145 in addition camel vaccines against mers-cov are a consideration at present at least two promising candidate camel vaccines are undergoing development and field trial evaluation is in progress108146 one study found that the rbd fragment covering spike residues 377588 is a key neutralizing receptor-binding fragment and an ideal candidate for mers vaccines147 another potential neutralizing epitope is a peptide fragment covering 736761 residues of the s protein which blocks the membrane fusion and cellular entry of mers-cov114 fig 5 recombinant viruses may be employed to generate an immune response against the viruses there are two kinds of recombinant viruses which are promising for designing a protective vaccine the first is a defective or nonpathogenic vector capable of expressing viral proteins and the second is a vector that can be assembled in a test tube to stimulate the assembly of virus-like particles adenosine deaminase ada a kind of human enzyme could interact with dpp4 therefore ada could compete with mers-cov as a natural antagonist when the virus attempts to bind to cells148 in addition anti-dpp4 can play a similar role149 however it is not practical to use this method in vivo because dpp4 has important functions in the regulation of several different signaling pathways150 this topic has intrigued the community understanding certain mechanisms about virus interactions will support drug research activities for instance it was found that sars-cov-2 has a stronger more rapid spreading ability than many known viruses is it possible that it invades host cells via additional novel routes not limited to ace2 for example cd147 is probably involved in virus invasion82 is there an s-like protein involved in invasion the affinity of the human ace2 protein for the rbd of the new coronavirus is 1020 times higher than it is for that of the sars virus which likely explains why sars-cov-2 spreads more swiftly there is a distinct insert present in the peptide fragment spanning of s1s2 loop of the sars-cov-2 s protein which is not shared the similarity with sars-cov or any sars-related viruses does this peptide loop impact on the entry pathway type of sars-cov-2 compared to other known betacoronavirus lineage b furthermore the s protein is likely cleaved during virus assembly and delivery to the cell surface by golgi-resident proprotein convertases such as furin151 which is different from the behavior of its close relatives furin is found in a variety of human tissues including the lungs liver and small intestine therefore which are exactly the cell types that sars-cov-2 may attack yet in relation to the last two questions it should be noted that studies are also necessary to investigate any possibility of receptor-independent virus entry the sars-cov-2 genome encodes nonstructural proteins structural proteins and accessory proteins 3clpro plpro helicase and rdrp which belong to the first type and the s protein which belongs to the second have been recognized as promising targets for developing antiviral agents against sars-cov and mers-cov which therefore may be applied to sars-cov-2 nonetheless the rapid identification of effective interventions against sars-cov-2 is a major challenge however the subject of using currently known antiviral drugs has been frequently brought up by the community as a potential short-term strategy to combat sars-cov-2 drugs affecting such targets and their status for sars-cov-2 are listed below the main candidates as inhibitors of 3clpro include lopinavir ritonavir darunavir cobicistat and asc09f phase iii in combination with oseltamivir for sars-cov-2152 candidates as inhibitors of plpro include thiopurine analogs compound 6 preclinical and remdesivir phase iii for mars-cov121153 favipiravir ribavirin randomized trial for sars-cov-2 and remdesivir are among the candidate inhibitors of rdrp118 previously compounds that may interfere with atpase and helicase activities were reported before covid-19 such as bananins 5-hydroxychromone derivatives and triazole derivatives preclinical3478 candidates that may suppress viral entry by targeting the s protein include peptide p9 and -helical lipopeptides preclinical154 and those targeting the s2 subunit of the s protein mainly include hr1p hr1m hr1l hr2l hr2p and hr2l preclinical155 due to the strong affinity between ace2 receptor and the rbd of sars-cov-2 another opportunity might be through the development of antibodies to block ace2 the second method is to use a large amount of soluble ace2 to directly block the spike protein the third method is to find a drug that directly inhibits the spike membrane fusion process such as the aids drug enfuvirtide the fourth approach is to identify an agent that inhibits the activity of disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 adam17 which may also prevent viral release and proliferation in cells and protect ace2 and the lungs87 sars-cov-2 vaccines are already under development the mrna and dna vaccines are promising approaches to prevent cellular invasion by similar coronaviruses in the future in january 2020 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi announced three partnerships to develop a new coronavirus vaccine among them moderna and inovio presented mrna and dna vaccine technologies respectively the goal of the three teams is to have at least one candidate vaccine capable of preventing coronavirus infection in 16 weeks to be tested in a phase i clinical trial modernas vaccine model is designed to use mrnas to safely pre-expose the immune system to a small amount of encoded proteins usually generated by the pathogen so that the immune system becomes prepared to fight future pathogens and prevent infection the candidate genes developed by moderna contain mrnas and combining multiple mrnas into a single vaccine might be useful to rapidly induce responses which is an approach that may be applied for future emerging pandemic threats too at the same time because the mrna in the cell will be degraded over time the mrna vaccine will not continue to produce antigen components for a long time which can avoid the risk of continued stimulation of the immune system generally mrna vaccines are also described as simple to prepare and to yield remarkable results additional advantages as well as disadvantages of nucleic acid-based vaccines were described in detail furthermore the basis of traditional vaccines proteins or polysaccharides cannot be straight forward applied at present against many pathogens therefore mrna vaccines would be suitable for achieving rapid mass production of emergency vaccines in the event of a major epidemic however because rna is easily degraded inducing cells to absorb mrna quickly is a challenge in recent years the method for delivery of mrna into cells has been greatly improved and stemirna and moderna have adopted nanolipid lpp or lnp lipid nanoparticle drug-loading technology however this is still to be developed for mrnas furthermore ensuring safety and effectiveness is another challenge for viral mrna vaccines and clinical validation will have to be carried out carefully moderna is a worldwide leader in mrna therapy with currently nine mrna-type vaccine candidates eg mrna-1273 against sars-cov-2 the national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases niaid of the national institutes of health nih and the mrna vaccine giant moderna have teamed up to bring the new coronavirus vaccine possibly to phase ii within a few months and phase iii late this year simultaneously in january 2020 the translational medicine platform of dongfang hospital affiliated with tongji university cooperated with stemirna shanghai biotechnology co ltd to rapidly promote the development of a new coronavirus mrna vaccine in february 2020 the chinese scientific research team announced that animal testing of the newly developed coronavirus vaccine has begun if animal testing goes well this new vaccine will enter human clinical trials within a few months also in february 2020 zhuhai livanda biotechnology co ltd announced that the first batch of new coronavirus mrna vaccine standard samples completed during the spring festival had been delivered to relevant national authorities on for animal testing and efficacy verification the researchers detected the production of target antibodies in mouse serum at day 12 following immunization the company claimed that this was also the first time worldwide that new coronavirus vaccines developed based on mrna technology have resulted in antibodies in animals livanda is currently pushing ahead with the project through extensive cooperation with the academy of military medical sciences the guangdong provincial institute of supervision and the macau university of science and technology the antigen used in its development is the same as that used by moderna dna vaccine technology may have many advantages eg safe fast less technical barriers along with potential limitations too156 a phase i human clinical trial of the mers-cov vaccine has proven its safety and effectiveness157 the dna vaccine based on the sars-cov s protein developed by the team of barney graham and gary nabel of the us-nih vaccine research center vrc has achieved positive results in animal experiments and a clinical phase i trial158159 inovio pharmaceuticals has accumulated extensive safety and immunogenicity data for mers-cov vaccine studies because of the high degree of similarity between mers-cov and sars-cov-2 lessons from such a vaccine development process may be beneficial for the development of a dna vaccine against sars-cov-2 since january 2020 inovio has been collaborating with several experts and companies some in china and has currently already begun phase i clinical trials of the dna vaccine ino-4800 chinas cansino biologics might be the leader as it was announced it has moved to phase ii testing of a vaccine called ad5-ncov the latter is currently often being reported as a dna vaccine but to be precise it uses viral vectors adenovirus to deliver dna related to sars-cov-2 part of the project is carried out currently with the chinese military medical research institute the vaccine candidate is constructed using genetic engineering methods and defective human type 5 adenovirus as a vector that can express the sars-cov-2 s antigen to stimulate the body to produce strong humoral or cellular immunity sars-cov and mers-cov belong to subgroups 2b and 2c of the betacoronaviruses respectively and sars-cov-2 is a new member of betacoronaviruses distinct from sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are similar in terms of invasion and self-replication whereas mers-cov has different targets the cellular receptor of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is ace2 plus cd147 for sars-cov-2 while that of mers-cov is dpp4 cd26 all of them evolved a mechanism to escape the host cell immune system sars-cov and sars-cov-2 affect the ras system by suppressing ace2 leading to the onset of symptoms mers-cov causes symptoms by producing inflammatory cytokines and invading t cells sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections have similar symptoms including fever cough myalgia and shortness of breath among others current treatments for sars mainly include ifn- antiviral treatments eg ribavirin plasma therapy host-directed therapies and systemic corticosteroids for mers several therapeutics are in development including convalescent plasma lopinavirritonavir ribavirin ifn and novel therapies including polyclonal antibodies broad-spectrum antivirals and amps for covid-19 candidates mainly include drugs targeting the s protein nonstructural proteins 3clpro plpro helicase and rdrp and viral rna synthesis blockers such as remdesivir and ribavirin vaccines such as dna vaccine mrna vaccine and recombinant vaccines are being rapidly developed so far this century human beings have experienced several epidemic outbreaks and each outbreak had a negative impact at different levels including health economy and even psychology and human behavior in the future more precautious measures should be available to guide individuals and groups to take effective emergency measures and to support social stability and physical and mental health furthermore additional studies of coronaviruses and disease epidemics should continue to support the preparation for future responses medical therapies vaccines and methods of relieving personal anxiety this review has highlighted several approaches and the names and progress related to several compounds and biologics currently under research and development as well as the companies and researchers involved in these efforts for future directions it has also described the differences and similarities as well as the potential routes and possibilities for targeting each of the main three viruses investigated here  ovine rotavirus strain llr-85-based bovine rotavirus candidate vaccines construction characterization and immunogenicity evaluation ji-tao chang xin li hai-jun liu li yu   the rotaviruses rvs compose a genus within the family reoviridae and comprise seven distinct groups ag of which groups ac rotaviruses are those currently found in both humans and animals whereas viruses in groups dg have been found only in animals to date knipe and peter 2007 the rotavirus genome is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded rna and can undergo genetic reassortment during mixed infections leading to progeny viruses with novel or atypical phenotypes there were numerous descriptions of rotavirus strains isolated from human and animals that share genetic and antigenic features of viruses from heterologous species matthijnssens et al 2006 rahman et al 2005 santos and hoshino 2005 recently there were reports of novel rotaviruses that are apparently derived from transmission between human and sheep ciarlet et al 2008 matthijnssens et al 2009 the emergence of novel strains derived from interspecies transmission has implications for design and implementation of successful reassortant rotavirus vaccine strategies in prior studies a dual classification system based on the two major outer capsid proteins defines several g and p genotypes of group a rotaviruses to date 23 g and 31 p genotypes have been identified based on the glycosylated vp7 and the protease-sensitive vp4 schumann et al 2009 ursu et al 2009 recently a novel classification system based on the nucleotide sequences of all rotavirus genome segments has been suggested matthijnssens et al 2008a matthijnssens et al 2008b enabling a comprehensive characterization of rotavirus strains based on nucleotide identity cut-off percentages different genotypes were defined for each genome segment the calculated cut-off values for the 11 rotavirus rna segments vp7 vp4 vp6 vp1 vp2 vp3 nsp1 nsp2 nsp3 nsp4 and nsp56 are 80 80 85 83 84 81 79 85 85 85 and 91 respectively to designate the complete genetic makeup of a virus the schematic nomenclature was proposed gx-px-ix-rx-cx-mx-ax-nx-tx-ex-hx representing the genotypes of respectively the vp7vp4vp6vp1vp2vp3nsp1nsp2nsp3nsp4nsp56 encoding gene segments with x indicating the number of the corresponding genotypes group a rotaviruses which are transmitted by the fecaloral route and selectively infect the mature villous absorptive epithelial cells holland 1990 cause disease that varies in severity including asymptomatic infection mild and self-limiting diarrhea or severe diarrhea with excessive fluid loss and severe electrolyte imbalance diarrhea is one of the most important diseases of neonatal dairy and beef calves and substantial economic loss occurs due to increased morbidity and mortality treatment costs and reduced growth rates house 1978 for example livestock and poultry production with 70 billion per year industry in the united states is estimated to suffer a 1520 annual loss in potential productivity from disease and environmental problems united states department of agriculture 1987 in which calf loss from diarrhea is an important segment of total loss in cattle industry it was reported in the late 1970s that enteric pathogens killed up to 25 of calves per year resulting in more than 250 million in losses hunt 1985 rotavirus coronavirus escherichia coli strain k99 coccidia and cryptosporidium parvum are the main infectious agents inducing enteric infections in neonatal calves less than 2 months of age among the pathogens described above rotavirus as a major cause of neonatal bovine diarrhea bellinzoni et al 1990 bendali et al 1999 de la fuente et al 1998 maes et al 2003 reynolds et al 1986 was found to be responsible for approximately 46 of the scours cases in dairy calves snodgrass et al 1986 in addition to causing economic losses diarrhea in livestock is important because of the public health implications thus the availability of a safe and effective bovine rotavirus vaccine capable of preventing this enormous economic and public health burden would represent a global goal the advent in 1998 of the first licensed human rotavirus vaccine a rrv rhesus rotavirus -based quadrivalent vaccine rotashield wyeth-lederle vaccines and pediatrics philadelphia pa kapikian 2001 provided an impetus for the expansion of programs of global human rotavirus strain surveillance and assessment of the rotavirus disease burden in addition availability in the early 1990s of a reliable and relatively easy methodology for rotavirus g and p genotyping accelerated this trend das et al 1994 fischer and gentsch 2004 gentsch et al 1992 gouvea et al 1990 such information has indeed influenced the approaches to the development of an effective rotavirus vaccine for example additional candidate human rotavirus vaccines have been constructed that would give antigenic coverage not only for g1g4 but also g5 g6 and g810 as well as p1a8 p1b4 and p2a6 hoshino et al 2005 however there was limited research in the field of animal rotavirus vaccine the bovine rotavirus isolate the lincoln strain g6 genotype was adapted to serial propagation in cell culture fernelius et al 1972 mebus et al 1971 which resulted in an attenuated virus for calves mebus et al 1973 this attenuated strain was incorporated into a vaccine licensed by the us department of agriculture usda in 1973 for oral inoculation of newborn calves or intramuscular inoculation of pregnant cows to provide passive protection to their calves apart from this there was no advent of new bovine rotavirus vaccine in the world field surveys have demonstrated that so far g genotype g6 and g10 are the epidemiologically most important bovine rotavirus genotypes worldwide accounting for 90 of the rotavirus-caused diarrhea approximately next to the g6 and g10 genotypes g8 is the third typical bovine rotavirus genotype alfieri et al 2004 chang et al 1996 falcone et al 1999 garaicoechea et al 2006 monini et al 2008 parwani et al 1993 reidy et al 2006 snodgrass et al 1990 in china our epidemiologic surveillance has shown that rotavirus diarrhea is one of the most important diseases of neonatal calves and that g6 and g10 were also determined to be the most prevalent genotype of the bovine rotaviruses using nested rt-pcr and sequencing chang et al 2008 since monovalent rotavirus vaccine cannot completely protect against heterologous rotavirus infection feng et al 1994 the multivalent rotavirus vaccine candidates are the most important research goal for the protective immunity of rotaviruses in addition the reassortant rotavirus vaccine approaches have been successfully employed to develop various human rotavirus candidate vaccines that include rhesus rotavirus based and bovine rotavirus based multivalent vaccines listed earlier hoshino et al 2002 hoshino et al 2003 hoshino et al 2005 midthun et al 1985 midthun et al 1986 in this study an ovine rotavirus strain llr-85-based bovine rotavirus reassortant was constructed and combined with its parental virus llr-85 as bivalent vaccine candidates for providing an attenuation phenotype of an ovine rotavirus in bovines and antigenic coverage of the main bovine rotavirus genotypes for g6 and g10 our study showed that the bivalent vaccine candidates can induce immune response of igg and iga antibodies in the sera of the inoculated colostrum-deprived neonatal calves and fecal shedding of rotavirus is uncommon following oral inoculation of calves with the rotavirus vaccine candidates the bovine rotavirus strain ncdv g6 p1 which was originally isolated in the stool of a neonatal calf with diarrhea in nebraska usa in 1971 fernelius et al 1972 was obtained commercially from china institute of veterinary drug control beijing the ovine rotavirus strain llr-85 g10 p15 chen et al 2009 knipe and peter 2007 which was initially derived from a lamb with diarrhea in qinghai province china in 1981 zhou et al 1985 was propagated from monovalent human rotavirus vaccine llr lanzhou institute of biological products china bai et al 1994 these virus strains were adapted to growth in ma104 cell line and passaged 10 times on dmem medium gibco before a triple plaque purification colostrum-deprived newborn calves without antibodies to rotavirus were divided into three groups to orally inoculate candidate vaccines within 24 h after their birth the calves were kept separate from each group and fed the substituted milk primers for the amplification of gene segments vp4 vp6 nsp1 nsp2 nsp4 and nsp5 were synthesized table 1
 based on the previous study park et al 2006 rt-pcr was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step of 60 min at 42 c followed by pcr for activation at 94 c for 5 min 30 cycles of amplification 45 s at 94 c 45 s at 55 c and 60s at 72 c for vp4 vp6 nsp1 and nsp4 and 45 s at 94 c 45 s at 50 c and 60s at 72 c for nsp2 and nsp5 with a final extension of 10 min at 72 c the pcr amplicons were purified with the gel extraction kit tiangen biotech co ltd china and sequenced by shanghai sangon biological engineering technology  services co ltd china the sequences were analyzed with lasergene software version 72 rna polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page was done as previously described chudzio et al 1989 briefly the supernatant of the culture lysates were mixed with an equal volume of rna extraction buffer 002 m trishydrochloride ph 74 03 m nacl 001 m mgcl2 01 sodium dodecyl sulfate 0005 m edta 4 sucrose and 004 bromophenol blue and each preparation was mixed with an one-tenth volume of phenolchloroform 11 and vortexed for 30 s to yield a homogeneous suspension followed by spinning in a microcentrifuge at 12000  
g for 10 min the upper layer dark blue solution containing the double-stranded segments of rna was collected and stored at 4 c or 20 c for electrophoretic analysis by the standard 10 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis genomic rnas were electrophoresed at 10 ma for 16 h and the resulting migration patterns were visualized by staining of gel with silver nitrate confluent cell line of fetal rhesus monkey kidney ma104 was co-infected at a multiplicity of infection moi of one with bovine rotavirus strain ncdv and ovine rotavirus strain llr-85 when approximately 75 of the infected cells exhibited cytopathic effects the cultures were frozen and thawed three times and the lysate was plated on ma104 cells in a six-well plate for selection of the desired reassortant each desired reassortant was plaque purified three times in ma104 cells and then its genomic rnas were analyzed by page to confirm the origin of genes of each reassortant when the parental origin of a gene was questionable by page the indistinguishable rna segments were analyzed by sequence analysis for confirmation the plaque assay was performed with techniques similar to those of matsuno et al 1977 briefly ma-104 cell monolayers were prepared in six-well tissue culture dishes and washed three times with pbs buffer serial tenfold dilutions of virus prepared in dmem without fbs were inoculated in 02-ml amounts after 1 h of adsorption at 37 c each culture received 2 ml of agar overlay medium which consisted of 1 purified agar in dmem containing 5 g of trypsin per ml after the agar overlay solidified the dishes were placed in an inverted position in a co2 incubator at 37 c for 35 days then an equal amount of a second agar overlay medium containing 1 purified agar in dmem and 0003 neutral red was added and plaques were counted the next day two calves were orally inoculated with 36  106 tcid50 of the attenuated llr-85 two calves were orally inoculated with 32  1065 tcid50 of the reassortant r191 and seven calves were orally inoculated simultaneously with 18  106 tcid50 of the attenuated llr-85 and 16  1065 tcid50 of the reassortant r191 table 2
 rectal swab specimens were collected each day over the 7-day experimental period postinoculation to detect rotavirus blood samples were collected at postinoculation days pids 0 10 21 and 28 processed for serum and kept at 20 c until they were tested plates were coated overnight at 4 c with semipurified brv or mock-infected cell culture supernatant in 01 m carbonatebicarbonate buffer ph 96 followed by a blocking step of 1 h at 37 c with 5 nonfat dry milk the plates were washed three times with 05 tween 20 in pbs ph 74 serial twofold dilutions starting at 1100 of each test sample were added to duplicate wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 c after washing the plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against bovine igg or iga with dilution of 15000 and 12000 respectively for 1 h at 37 c after washing the plates were incubated with 18 tmb 3355-tetramethylbenzidine substrate for 20 min at room temperature the reaction was stopped with 2 m h2so4 the a

 electrophoretic migration patterns of genomic rnas of the parental viruses and the desired reassortant showed that the desired reassortant derived vp1 vp2 vp3 and nsp3 gene segments from the llr-85 strain and derived vp7 gene segment from the ncdv strain the remaining gene segments could not be confirmed by rna page and were further confirmed by sequence analysis a comparison of vp4 nsp1 vp6 nsp2 nsp4 and nsp5 gene segments of the desired reassortant with that of the parental viruses was shown in table 3
 for the vp4 nsp1 vp6 nsp2 nsp4 and nsp5 genes nucleotide sequence identities between the reassortant and llr-85 were 998 999 997 999 100 and 100 respectively whereas nucleotide sequence identities between the reassortant and ncdv were 711 760 844 876 812 and 927 respectively indicating that the desired reassortant derived vp4 nsp1 vp6 nsp2 nsp4 and nsp5 gene segments from the llr-85 strain thus the ovine rotavirus llr-85-based reassortant with a single vp7 gene of bovine rotavirus strain ncdv named as r191 here was confirmed by rna page fig 1 and sequence analysis table 3 r191 as well as its parental strains ncdv and llr-85 were propagated on confluent monolayers of ma104 cells at the equal moi of 01 to determine the growth property of the reassortant infection was terminated at postinoculation hours 12 24 36 48 and 72 and the titers of the harvested viruses were determined as plaque-forming units pfu per ml by plaque assay technique the results showed that the titers of the r191 and llr-85 on peak days of virus growth were very similar 1074 and 1072

 indicating that the replication efficiency of the reassortant r191 in ma104 cells was not influenced by substitution of the vp7 gene to evaluate the humoral immune responses induced by the oral administrations of the reassortant rotavirus r191 and one of its parental viruses llr-85 the colostrums-deprived newborn calves without antibodies to rotavirus were orally inoculated with the reassortant r191 andor the parental virus llr-85 within 24 h after their birth as described in table 2 two calves in the group 1 were inoculated with the reassortant r191 another two calves in the group 2 were inoculated with the parental rotavirus llr-85 and seven calves in the group 3 were simultaneously inoculated with the reassortant r191 and the parental rotavirus llr-85 blood samples were collected at pids 0 10 21 and 28 to prepare serum all sera were diluted hundredfold to detect igg and iga antibodies to group a rotavirus by indirect elisa the kinetics of rotavirus-specific igg and iga antibodies in sera of the calves inoculated with the rotavirus vaccine candidates were depicted in fig 3
 results showed that seroconversion of igg and iga antibodies to the rotavirus occurred at pid 10 in all of the inoculated calves and increased to the peak at pid 21 serum samples at pid 21 in all of the calves were serially twofold diluted starting at a dilution of 1100 followed by detection of the titers of rotavirus-specific igg and iga antibodies to group a rotavirus by indirect elisa the results showed that the titers of serum igg antibodies were between 1800 and 16400 and the titers of serum iga antibodies were between 1800 and 13200 table 4
 in order to determine the profile of virus shedding after inoculation of the rotavirus vaccine candidates fecal rotavirus shedding was investigated each day over the 7-day experimental period postinocuation low-speed centrifugation supernatants of suspensions of rectal swab specimens were detected and typed by rt-pcr gouvea et al 1990 gouvea et al 1994 and results are described in table 2 results showed that in the three inoculated groups during the first 7 days of oral inoculation with the rotavirus vaccine candidates 2 of 77 fecal specimens 26 collected from the 11 inoculated calves contained the inoculated rotavirus the two rotavirus-positive specimens were collected from the same calf no 4 in the group 3 at the first and third day postinoculation no inoculated rotavirus was detected in other fecal specimens collected from the inoculated calves between 1 and 7 days postinoculation in prior study theil and mccloskey 1995 rotavirus was detected in 1 of 41 daily fecal specimens collected from the calves following oral inoculation with a usda-licensed modified live bovine rotavirus-coronavirus vaccine in our study the low shedding rate 277 26 was similar to the result 141 24 of previous study indicating that our vaccine candidates are safe and well tolerated in the colostrums-deprived neonatal calves in 1969 a previously unrecognized virus recovered from diarrheic calves in nebraska usa was described and shown to induce diarrhea in experimentally inoculated hysterectomy-derived colostrum-deprived calves mebus et al 1969 this virus was initially referred to as neonatal calf diarrhea virus nebraska calf diarrhea virus reo-like virus or reovirus-like agent but is now known as bovine rotavirus the name rotavirus was ultimately chosen because of the wheel-like appearance of the virus on transmission electron microscopy tem today rotaviral infections are proven to be a common economically important cause of calf diarrhea throughout the world genotypic analyses of a major neutralization protein vp7 of a bovine rotavirus in diarrheal stools collected in different cattle populations throughout the world have shown that the majority of typeable rotavirus isolates belong to g genotypes 6 and 10 alfieri et al 2004 chang et al 1996 falcone et al 1999 garaicoechea et al 2006 monini et al 2008 parwani et al 1993 reidy et al 2006 snodgrass et al 1990 since the first licensed bovine rotavirus vaccine was a monovalent one monovalent rotavirus vaccine cannot completely protect against heterologous rotavirus infection feng et al 1994 we constructed a reassortant rotavirus strain r191 that contains a single vp7 gene encoding genotype g6 specificity of bovine rotavirus ncdv strain and the remaining 10 genes of ovine rotavirus strain llr-85 the reassortant r191 and its parental rotavirus strain llr-85 were used as bivalent vaccine candidates to provide i an attenuation phenotype of an ovine rotavirus in bovines and ii antigenic coverage for g6 and g10 of the main bovine rotavirus genotypes the attenuated virus strains r191 and llr-85 were shown experimentally in colostrum-deprived neonatal calves to be able to induce high levels of serum igg and iga antibodies to rotavirus whereas fecal shedding of the rotaviruses was uncommon in the inoculated calves and therefore are promising bivalent vaccine candidates for prevention of bovine g6 and g10 rotavirus infection the benefits for using the llr-85 strain instead of an attenuated bovine rotavirus strain in production of the reassortant for vaccine purposes are that the former is attenuated in calves due to host range restriction but the latter is often unstable and may develop back mutation thus the llr-85 is more safe to calves secondly the passage history of the llr-85 is clear it is an attenuated strain to lambs and children bai et al 1994 therefore should be safe to people and there is no public health problem thirdly the rna segments of the llr-85 are easily distinguished on the page electrophoretic migration pattern which is useful to identify the reassortant lastly and importantly the llr-85 strain is highly immunogenic to neonatal calves some nucleotide mutations of the vp4 nsp1 vp6 and nsp2 gene segments of the r191 occurred in the process of generation and purification of the reassortant there existed the insignificant differences of 2 nucleotides nt 1nt 1nt and 1nt between the r191 and the parental llr-85 for the vp4 nsp1 vp6 and nsp2 gene segments respectively obviously the possible reasons to induce these nucleotide mutations were serial tissue culture passage for the six-time plaque purifications of the reassortant r191 on ma104 cells the mechanisms responsible for immunity to rotavirus infections and illness are not completely understood in animals knipe and peter 2007 animal models have been particularly instructive in elucidating the role of antibodies and in dissecting the relative importance of systemic and local immunity initially the observations of some related studies suggested that antibodies in the lumen of the small intestine were the primary determinant of resistance to rotavirus illness whereas circulating serum antibodies failed to protect bridger and woode 1975 offit and clark 1985 snodgrass and wells 1976 woode et al 1975 but the subsequent study showed that systemic rotavirus antibodies are present in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract of neonatal calves if the level of circulating antibodies is sufficiently high such serum-derived mucosal antibodies can provide protection against experimentally induced infection and diarrhea besser et al 1988 the association between the titers of serum anti-rotavirus igg and iga antibodies and protection against infection and illness was investigated in 100 children under 18 months of age attending day care centers in the united states for one or two rotavirus seasons oryan et al 1994 these studies showed that preexisting serum anti-rotavirus iga titer of greater than 1200 or igg titer of greater than 1800 was associated with protection against infection a similar study of mexican infants also demonstrated that both serum iga and igg were protective but the titers needed to achieve significant protection were higher than those found in the us study velazquez et al 2000 these previous studies about the association between serum anti-rotavirus antibodies and protection against infection and illness suggested that serum antibodies if present at critical levels are either protective themselves or are an important and powerful correlate of protection against rotavirus disease even though other host effectors may play an important role as well in this study we want to evaluate the immunogenicity of the rotavirus vaccine candidates so we used the major structural protein in virus particles of the semipurified brv as antigen to detect the igg and iga antibodies against the group a rotavirus in serum of the inoculated calves and the results showed that the highest titers of serum igg and iga antibodies were obtained at pid 21 the calves in all inoculated groups developed high levels of serum anti-rotavirus igg antibodies range 1800 to 16400 and serum anti-rotavirus iga antibodies range 1800 to 13200 these results suggested that the animals inoculated with llr-85-based vaccine candidates would develop antibodies to the inoculated viruses and indicated that the attenuated virus strains llr-85 and r191 were well immunogenic to neonatal calves and preexisting serum anti-rotavirus iga titers range 1800 to 13200 reached to level of protective immunity however further evaluation is needed for a protective immune response of the llr-85-based candidate vaccines in future trials to date there is no criterion for fecal shedding rate of the rotavirus vaccine strains in prior study vaccine rotavirus was detected in only 1 of 41 daily fecal specimens collected from the calves following oral inoculation with a usda-licensed modified live bovine rotaviruscoronavirus vaccine by using negative stain electron microscopy in contrast rotavirus was demonstrable by the same negative stain electron microscopic examination procedure in 17 of 19 fecal specimens collected from the calves after inoculation with virulent bovine rotavirus field strains theil and mccloskey 1995 in our study vaccine rotavirus was detected in only 2 of 77 daily rectal swab specimens collected from 11 neonatal calves following oral inoculation with the rotavirus vaccine candidates this low shedding rate 277 26 was similar to the result of previous study 141 24 suggesting that the r191 and llr-85 are safe to calves based on the uncommon fecal shedding of the rotavirus the procedure that we have used in the present study for the successful construction and selection of the single vp7 gene substitution reassortant rotavirus vaccine is relatively easy to perform in recent years rare genotypes of bovine rotavirus such as g5 and g15 were also isolated in calves ghosh et al 2008 park et al 2006 so with this procedure additional llr-85-based reassortant rotavirus vaccine candidates that carry vp7 gene encoding a desired bovine rotavirus g genotype specificity can be generated readily in the future when the need for such g genotypes is warranted from epidemiologic studies  cepi

 in recent decades the world has been shaken by the emergence and spread of new viral diseases although the worlds response to the 20142015 ebola epidemic was laudable there is a general consensus that much more could have been done to prevent the deaths of thousands of people and billions of dollars of economic damage as a result of this epidemic 1 despite many laboratory studies of candidate vaccines before the trials of the vesicular stomatitis virusebola virus vaccine merck kenilworth new jersey in guinea in 2016 no vaccine had ever been developed in time to alter the course of a new disease outbreak and that vaccine arrived late in the epidemic 2 until quite recently coordination of stakeholder responses across institutions and sectors has lagged behind the epidemic curves of emerging infectious diseases eids 3 research and development rd priorities for improving preparedness have been driven primarily by bioterrorism concerns in some countries leaving sparse product development pipelines for eids that fall outside national security agendas 2 in addition development of eid countermeasures has been unappealing for manufacturers who see little commercial benefit because of the sporadic disease burden and lengthy risky and costly product development 4 these challenges notwithstanding the west african ebola epidemic led to a paradigm shift in eid preparedness 5 6 experimental vaccines and therapeutics were deployed during this outbreak thanks to over a decade of rd into biodefense-related ebola countermeasures and because the vesicular stomatitis virusebola virus vaccine manufactured by merck demonstrated effectiveness in field trials 7 however none of these products was ready to deploy in time to change the course of the outbreak due to the insufficiency of clinical data on safety and efficacy plus absence of product stockpiles although the trials assessing the vesicular stomatitis virusebola virus vaccine did not commence until late in the epidemic their success suggested a pathway for better preparedness against future epidemics namely advancement of biomedical countermeasures through human trials in anticipation of emergencies and making the most promising of these quickly available for efficacy testing and use if and when emergencies were to occur in acknowledgment that a better system would be needed to improve the worlds preparedness and response capacity against future epidemic threats 3 810 several important initiatives were launched shortly after the 20142015 ebola epidemic had been contained in may 2016 the world bank established the pandemic emergency finance facility to quickly release funds to affected countries for epidemic responses 11 at the same time the world health organization who published its blueprint priority diseases list for eid preparedness and response identifying 11 pathogens with the potential to cause severe outbreaks in the near term the initial list as of may 2016 8 comprised crimean congo hemorrhagic fever chikungunya ebola virus disease marburg virus disease lassa fever middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus mers-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome nipah virus disease rift valley fever severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome and zika virus the revised list as of february 2018 12 comprised crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever priority list ebola virus disease marburg virus disease priority list lassa fever priority list mers-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome priority list nipah and henipaviral diseases priority list rift valley fever priority list zika virus priority list disease x priority list arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers other than lassa fever watchlist chikungunya watchlist highly pathogenic coronaviral diseases other than mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome watchlist emergent nonpolio enteroviruses including ev71 d68 watchlist and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome watchlist earlier that year inspired by a call for a new vaccine fund 5 global thought leaders from governments industry and civil society also met at the world economic forum in davos switzerland and agreed to explore new ways to drive product innovation for high-priority epidemic threats 13 after the davos 2016 meeting 3 task teams convened in 2016 between february and june to define sustainable solutions for development of eid vaccines to improve global preparedness and response capacity 6 1113 the task teams comprised 200 thought leaders and experts representing more than 80 organizations who drew insights from who blueprint priorities 12 industry and civil-society perspectives on the role of vaccines for the prevention of humanitarian crises caused by eids each task team explored challenges for the development of eid vaccines that could be used in epidemics including pathogen prioritization clinical development manufacturing capacity regulatory pathways models for product development partnerships and funding strategies 13 14 task team recommendations led to the formation of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi 13 14 a coalition by design cepi reflects an explicit awareness that no organization can drive vaccine development against known eids or unknown pathogens of epidemic potential ie disease x alone only together through a multilateral and collaborative approach can the complexities of vaccine development and delivery be addressed for the public good as such cepi was formally launched at the 2017 world economic forum meeting in davos with close to us500 million initial funding from the governments of norway japan and germany the bill  melinda gates foundation and wellcome 15 cepis initial strategic objectives established in 2016 13 were aimed at advancing vaccine candidates against each of its first priority pathogens lassa virus mers-cov a nipah virus through to evidence of safety and immunogenicity in humans phase 2a by 2022 and to establish a diverse portfolio of platform technologies that can accelerate development manufacture and clinical evaluation of vaccines in response to outbreaks of new eids designated disease x by who in january 2019 cepi expanded its list of priority pathogens to include chikungunya and rift valley fever according to initial estimates a minimum of 1 billion would be required to bring at least 4 eid vaccines through to the end of phase 2a trials and to fund investigational stockpiles of these in case of an international health emergency 16 two years into operation cepi has already secured more than 750 million to support its mission through the contributions of 7 government donors the european commission and 2 philanthropic organizations three calls for proposals have been issued inviting applications for rd investment two of these calls invited applications for vaccine development against specific priority eids initially against lassa virus mers-cov and nipah virus 17 and more recently against rift valley fever and chikungunya another call invited applications for rapid-response platform technologies to accelerate development of vaccines in response to epidemic outbreaks of known eids or of unexpectedly emerging infections disease x 18 so-called vaccine platform technologies comprise standardized reproducible manufacturing processes that can be adapted to produce vaccines against different pathogens the flexibility of these platforms improves manufacturing efficiency and can shorten the overall time frame for vaccine development 1921 cepi has also recently invited proposals for blood-specimen collection from survivors of lassa fever to support improved characterization of immune response and support development of assays and standards should this approach prove effective for lassa virus cepi will also consider expanding it for mers-cov and nipah virus as of september 2019 cepi has signed 16 partnership agreements with vaccine development partners table 1 these agreements will enable accelerated development of lassa mers-cov nipah and rift valley fever vaccine candidates over 5 years from the late preclinical phase to phase 2 and manufacture of an investigational stockpile for use in large-scale efficacy trials during an outbreak as well as late-stage clinical development of advanced chikungunya vaccines to accelerate regulatory approval so at-risk populations have access to these vaccines so far cepi has initiated projects to develop 17 vaccine candidates against its priority pathogensincluding 5 against lassa virus 4 against mers-cov 4 against nipah virus 2 against rift valley fever and 2 against chikungunyaand 3 vaccine manufacturing platforms to demonstrate the advantage of these platforms additional vaccine candidates will be produced and tested including 2 against influenza 2 against rabies 1 against mers-cov 1 against marburg virus 1 against lassa fever 1 against respiratory syncytial virus and 1 against yellow fever cepis rd portfolio includes several vaccines based on attenuated viruses viral vectors dna rna and protein-based approaches some of these technologies are established and already being tested in the clinic such as a measles-vectorbased vaccine against chikungunya developed by themis bioscience vienna austria 22 an attenuated virus vaccine against chikungunya developed by valneva vienna austria 23 a dna-based vaccine against lassa virus 24 and mers-cov being developed by inovio pharmaceuticals plymouth meeting pa 25 and an adenovirus-vectorbased vaccine against mers-cov being developed by the university of oxford oxford united kingdom 26 other approaches such as rna vaccines are in earlier phases of development but show great promise for application against multiple pathogens and rapid production in addition cepi has set aside funds to support the development of ebola vaccines this research funding will be complementary to current efforts in this field and investments will be coordinated with other funders where necessary to avoid duplication of work over the past 2 years cepi has made efforts to engage and coordinate its work with partners throughout global health and vaccine development to ensure the sustainability of its approach to vaccine development the coalition has been working with industry partnersfrom small biotechnology companies to large manufacturersthrough partnerships that share the risks of vaccine development table 1 cepi also coordinates its efforts with several multilateral partners principally through an interinstitutional roundtable which we refer to as the joint coordination group the joint coordination group includes who and key organizations responsible for vaccine procurement delivery and implementation as well as representatives of important regulatory agencies and works to identify ways in which predictable access to vaccines for priority populations can be achieved in emergency situations the overall goal for the joint coordination group is to optimize allocation of resources across disease areas and vaccine development to minimize funding overlap with partners and to improve response times to unexpected epidemic threats preparing for the next epidemic requires investment in platforms capable of rapid vaccine development and coordination among multiple stakeholders to which cepi and its coalition partners have committed substantial resources and attention as cepi begins to turn its promises into progress several challenges ought to be acknowledged first vaccine development is widely acknowledged as a long complex process often lasting over 10 years from discovery to licensure 27 second vaccine development is inherently risky with at least two-thirds of preclinical vaccine candidates likely to fail before reaching clinical proof of concept 28 in view of this risk of failure the full cost of successfully advancing a vaccine candidate from preclinical to clinical efficacy trials and readiness for emergency use can vary on average from 300 million to 500 million 28 cepi has so far committed more than 458 million to eid vaccine-development projects and whereas the full costs of vaccine development are expected to be shared with funding and development partners concrete clinical outcomes are likely going to take several years to materialize if vaccines were to be developed for all of the eids prioritized by who an average 2837 billion would be needed to support vaccine development through phase 2 trials depending on cost structures of vaccine development programs and rd pipeline attrition 28 improved coordination among industry global health and civil-society institutions and guidance from regulators will also be needed to determine the public health needs for key diseases and to iron out technical and regulatory pathways for feasible vaccine development as additional resources become available 29 cepi is diversifying its current vaccine rd investment portfolio to include additional pathogens beginning with chikungunya a debilitating mosquito-borne disease spread by aedes aegypti and a albopictus that affects millions of people globally and rift valley fever a viral zoonosis of cattle and other domesticated livestock that also infects humans 30 chikungunya infection can lead to substantial morbidity patients can experience arthralgia for months or even years and chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease develops in small subset of patients 28 the substantial burden of this disease for example coupled with a large vaccine pipeline relative to other eids could justify investments that might yield clinically relevant outcomes in a shorter time the quantity of antigen is generally expected to be different across eids however not knowing what quantity of antibody would be required to induce protection against chikungunya could make the identification of situations that would allow statistical demonstration of efficacy challenging feasibility of development would consequently depend on technical hurdles and regulatory guidance for appropriate clinical trial design in the case of rift valley fever 9 outbreaks have occurred between 2000 and 2016 with more than 4600 confirmed and suspected cases and more than 950 deaths 31 viral transmission in people occurs primarily through contact with the blood or organs of infected animals 31 however aedes and culex mosquitoes can also act as viral reservoirs and vectors 31 rift valley fever has a wide geographical range spreading throughout africa and into the saudi arabian peninsula 32 risk of further spread into europe and north america is also high 31 no licensed vaccine is available for human use but at least 2 vaccine candidates are currently in phase 2 trials 28 definition of regulatory pathways for clinical trials and emergency use will need to account for the specifics of each vaccine and the challenges posed by each eid at present it is unclear how regulatory processes for vaccine candidates could be accelerated in the event of an outbreak of known eids or disease x enhanced regulatory guidance and normative directions by coalition partners will be needed for approval of clinical trials and equitable access to eid vaccines during outbreaks prioritization of various countermeasures eg human vaccine vs animal vaccines or their combinations might also be required to optimize development of the most effective preparedness strategies for unexpected emergencies related to eid outbreaks such as rift valley fever and mers-cov as eid threats evolve increased coordination with who and public health agencies worldwide will be required to ensure product development is prioritized accordingly sustainable manufacturing solutions will also need to be negotiated soon for vaccine candidates nearing completion of safety and immunogenicity testing in humans mechanisms for funding and maintaining global stockpiles of investigational vaccines must be established as vaccine candidates continue to move through development cepi and its coalition partners soon must lay out a concrete plan for how such a procurement and stockpiling system could be established how much a system would cost by whom it would be operated and when it would need to be operationalized eids remain a major threat to global health security 4 years after the 20142015 ebola outbreak in west africa this threat is only likely to grow in the coming years as various ecological demographic and economic factors accelerate disease emergence and re-emergence in 2018 alone there were outbreaks of 6 of the 10 who priority pathogens 33 including 2 separate ebola outbreaks in the democratic republic of congo thankfully thousands of doses of the vesicular stomatitis virusebola virus vaccine have already been manufactured and the vaccines rollout will help avert a large-scale epidemic in the context of ebola cepi plans to make rd investments that complement current research efforts thanks to partnership efforts between cepi and a broad range of vaccine developers 5 vaccine candidates against lassa fever 4 for mers-cov and 4 for nipah virus are under development 2 rift valley vaccine candidates are about to initiate late-stage preclinical development and 2 chikungunya vaccine candidates are about to resume late-stage clinical development with additional cepi funding some of these vaccine candidates hopefully will meet the safety and immunogenicity profiles required for investigational stockpiling and use in large clinical trials and humanitarian responses in outbreak conditions the development of 3 rapid-response platform technologies for other threatening eids has also been initiated including pilots for lassa fever mers-cov influenza rabies respiratory syncytial virus marburg virus and yellow fever cepi will continue to enhance epidemic preparedness through targeted funding and technical oversight ultimately however cepis success will depend on the strength of the coalitions collaborative efforts across sectors institutions and geographic regions to develop effective eid vaccines and to ensure equitable access to them in global health emergencies  coronavirus vaccine light at the end of the tunnel krishna ella m v mohan krishna krishna mohan   structural analyses have shown that

cases 6  considering the infectivity and the severity of covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics to tackle this deadly disease are the greatest need of the hour global pandemic is a major public health concern modern means of travel and the volume of travel make it easier for any virus to rapidly spread across the world pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime low-probability event but a high-cost problem that should not be ignored the next pandemic was anticipated to be a more virulent form of influenza but the world is currently in the midst of a novel coronavirus pandemic though middle east respiratory syndrome mers and sars were featured in the whos list of critical infectious diseases in 2018 it was not anticipated to cause a global disease within a short span of time 7  such is the unpredictability of a global pandemic that the world is currently facing as the infectivity of the sars-cov-2 virus is very high compared to other corona viruses reported so far an effective vaccine is the best way to contain the rapidly escalating proliferation of this infection although the mortality rate is lower compared to other similar viral respiratory diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the magnitude of the infection caused by sars-cov-2 is severe and higher to a large extent leading to increased number of deaths worldwide sars-cov-2 infection has the potential to become a seasonal disease like influenza and persist with humanity in the future 8  an effective vaccine can help in reducing the rate of infection and can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 vaccine can also the world is currently facing an unprecedented global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 predicting the next source of the pandemic can be very challenging as vaccination is the best way to prevent an infectious disease the development of an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 can not only reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with it but can also lessen the economic impact as the traditional method of vaccine development takes many years for a vaccine to be available to the society the vaccine development for sars-cov-2 should be speeded up using a pandemic approach with fast-track approvals from the regulatory authorities various challenges associated with developing a vaccine during the pandemic such as technological hurdles clinical development pathways regulatory issues and support from global funding agencies are expressed here published online april 15 2020 pii s097475591600163 decrease the probability of resurgence of the disease and its future impact the implementation of an effective vaccination is the only way to moderate the economic burden of this unprecedented pandemic there is an urgent need to expedite the development of covid-19 vaccine the vaccine industry was able to develop h1n1 vaccine fairly rapidly because the technology and regulations were already in place to develop influenza vaccine global experiences with influenza vaccines have outlined the urgency for investing in modern technologies for faster vaccine development as well as increasing the scale of production customizing these technologies to various other viruses can speed up vaccine development during a pandemic organizations such as coalition for epidemic preparedness innovation cepi an innovative global partnership between public and private organizations are striving to quicken vaccine development for various potential and critical diseases as well as facilitate uniform availability of these life-saving vaccines cepi aims to develop vaccines for various pathogens till phase 2a stage which can be expedited to full-scale development during future outbreaks 9  cepi and the world bank organized a conference on the three main imperatives for covid-19 vaccine effort speed manufacture and deployment at scale and global access which has ultimately led to the formulation of covid-19 vaccine development taskforce 10  the wide ranges of technologies that are being developed for sars-cov-2 include nucleic acids protein subunit replicating viral vector non-replicating viral vector and inactivated virus approaches newer approaches based on nucleic acids such as dna or mrna can facilitate potentially rapid production as they do not need fermentation 9  for some platforms adjuvants could improve the immune responses with lower doses thus ensuring vaccination of larger populations without any reduction in efficacy 11  currently several platforms are being developed and the list of sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates in development is given in web table 1  the development of a vaccine for sars-cov-2 can cause distinct challenges  developing a viable immunogen using the various proteins of sars-cov-2 such as s protein n protein m protein is the initial challenge  development of successful animal model for covid-19 may be challenging although two animal models one hace2 transgenic mice model and another primate macaques model have been successfully developed this may be due to the highly infectious and pathogenic nature of the virus 12   vaccine development is a lengthy process starting from product development to the competition of the phase iii clinical trial before marketing the vaccine which can take several years usually 10 to 20 years  preclinical experience with other sars vaccine candidates has created red flags about worsening of the disease which may be attributed to antibodydependent enhancement  correlates of protection are not known  planning and coordinating clinical trials in these emergency-like situations can be difficult both for predicting the trial sites for outbreak as well as ensuring the sites preparedness  in a high-mortality situation such as covid-19 pandemic regulators may not accept conventionally designed clinical trials such as comparison with a placebo arm  viral mutation may lead to different subtypes thus causing difficulty in vaccine design  vaccines are generally manufactured using good manufacturing practices gmp to ensure that quality is controlled and consistency is maintained for many vaccine candidates in the current pipeline for sars-cov-2 these gmp processes need to be developed which can be time consuming  for vaccines that will be developed with novel technologies gmp needs to be developed from the beginning thus adding to the financial burden and delaying the production of vaccines  issues related to vaccine ownership funding pricing and supply chain and the coordinated administration strategy can pose significant barriers the traditional vaccine development process follows various phases such as product development preclinical clinical trial phases phase i ii and iii before the vaccine gets regulatory approval for marketing although phase iv and post-marketing surveillance studies are volume 57  may 15 2020 ella and mohan coronavirus vaccine light at the end of the tunnel conducted after marketing the product this traditional approach is time consuming and not feasible to follow during the pandemic keeping greater benefit of the vaccine for the societal need vaccine development using pandemic approach will be the best approach for rapid development of vaccines as shown in fig 1  this type of innovative approach can save the time spent in pre-clinical and clinical trial phases the regulators should consider this approach for faster approval of vaccines vaccine development during a pandemic should be considered as a global health emergency and not as any specific disease related issue which is a prerogative of vaccine manufacturers public funding for vaccine development should be the top priority as any vaccine development particularly during a pandemic can be a very risky investment and public funding can reduce the potential risk for vaccine manufacturers especially in the low and middle income countries pioneering finance mechanisms such as the international finance facility for immunization iffim that have been successful in the past should be used to fund the development of covid-19 vaccines 10  global alliance for vaccines and immunizations gavi board members also expressed support for the use of gavis innovative financing instruments such as its iffim and gavis advance market commitment to accelerate vaccine development and access where needed 13  there should be a global consensus and urgency for the development of a pandemic vaccine at both national and international level to ensure that the vaccines are available and affordable to those who need them the most 14   for novel platform technologies large-scale manufacturing can pose a significant financial risk as these facilities necessitate huge investments  high-income countries can procure large doses of vaccine for their own population creating disparities in the global supply and demand  high risk populations should be identified through epidemiological and serological studies and vaccine delivery should be prioritized this can halt the spread of the disease  as sars-cov-2 is a newer disease without adequate exposure in the population any new vaccine may probably necessitate more than one dose of the vaccine and protective immunity is usually achieved after the second dose massive effort will be needed to ensure vaccine distribution and administration  there can be a scenario albeit low-probability where the pandemic threat has been abruptly curtailed in such cases vaccine development should be continued for potential vaccine candidates to restrict future threats  the global vaccine development efforts for covid-19 pandemic are unparalleled in the current scenario there is an indication that vaccine could be available as early as 2021 this would be an extraordinary shift from the usual vaccine development timeframe which can range between 10-20 years a new virus target and newer technologies can multiply the vaccine development risks and dictates meticulous evaluation of safety and efficacy at every stage of vaccine development robust coordination between vaccine manufacturers regulatory authorities public health authorities and governments is essential to make sure that potential vaccine candidates are fast-tracked for approval manufactured and distributed seamlessly particularly for low-income countries considering the economic impact that covid-19 has already caused in the initial 3-4 months of this global calamity it is worthwhile to start investing in vaccines against emerging viruses including neglected diseases which can potentially cause significant human deaths and also impact the global economy global pandemics are inevitable there should be strategically prepared protocols and emergency plans to develop vaccines in months rather than years lessons learned in managing the covid-19 pandemic should pave the way for creating better roadmaps to face the next pandemic  identification of potential vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 a step forward to fight novel coronavirus 2019-ncov a reverse vaccinology approach ekta gupta rupesh kumar mishra ravi ranjan kumar niraj   b  the recent coronavirus disease 2019 causes an immense health crisis to global public health the world health organization who declared the covid-19 as a pandemic the covid-19 is the etiologic agent of a recently arose disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 presently there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease therefore it is indeed a need of the hour to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this decidedly pandemic disease in the current study we collected sars-cov-2 genome from indian geographical origin against human host further more using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics tools here we claim effective vaccine candidates that can be mile stone in battle against covid19 this novel study divulged two promising antigenic peptide gvyfastek and nfrvqptesiv from surface glycoproteins protein accession no -qia985831 and qhs345461 of sars-cov-2 which were predicated to be interacted with class i and class ii mhc alleles and showed up to 90 conservancy and high value of antigenicity subsequently the molecular docking studies were verified molecular interaction of these prime antigenic peptides with the residues of hla-a11-01 allele for mhc class i and hla drb104-01 allele for mhc class ii after vigorous analysis these peptides were predicted to be suitable epitopes which are capable to elicit the strong cell-mediated immune response against the sars-cov-2 consequences from the present study could facilitate selecting sars-cov-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines in the immediate future this novel research will certainly pave the way for a fast reliable and virtuous platform to provide timely countermeasure of this dangerous pandemic disease covid-19  the coronavirus disease 2019 begin in december 2019 like a viral outbreak in wuhan city of china 1  it gained rapid foothold across the world resulting in who declared it as a pandemic 2  as on april 5 th  worldwide total 1205825 cases and 64978 deaths were reported by who 3  in this period of time when the continuous transmission of the virus across borders and health burden on the global scale is rapidly increasing more urgent studies are required and in the absence of effective cures majorly drugs vaccination or immunization therapy is imperative in order to target whole population likewise to move forward vaccine development pipeline immunoinfomatics tools have been proved crucial 4  since the covid19 has affected almost all of the worlds population promiscuous epitopes binding to a variety of hla alleles for larger dissemination is vital for that in silico approaches will be remarkably useful in helping develop a cure in as fast manner as possible 5  the antibody generation by activation of b-cell as well as acute viral clearance by t-cells along with virus-specific memory generation by cd8 t-cells are analogously important to develop immunity against the virus 6  the s protein is considered highly antigenic and thereby can evoke strong immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can block the attachment of virus to the host cells 7  in reverse vaccinology various tools of in silico biology are used to discover the novel antigens by studying the genetic makeup of a pathogen and the genes that could lead to good epitopes are determined this method is a quick easy and cost-effective way to design vaccine 8  it is a process of vaccine development where the novel antigens are identified by analyzing the genomic information of a virus or other organism reverse vaccinology approach facilitates an easier and productive process of antigen discovery 9  herein we explored the proteome of sars-cov-2 of indian geographical origin against human host to identify potential antigenic proteins and epitopes that can effectively elicit cellular mediated immune response against covid-19 to do so we collected sars-cov2 genome from indian geographical origin against human host and applied in-silico approach this significant research disclosed two promising antigenic peptide gvyfastek and nfrvqptesiv from surface glycoproteins protein accession no -qia985831 and qhs345461 of sars-cov-2 they were predicted to be interacted with class i and class ii mhc alleles and displayed up to 90 conservancy and significant antigenicity further molecular docking analysis were confirmed the molecular interaction of such prime antigenic peptides with the residues of hla-a11-01 allele for mhc class i and hla drb104-01 allele for mhc class ii after careful evaluation these peptides were foreseen to be appropriate epitopes proficient to elicit the strong cell-mediated immune response against the sars-cov-2 the reverse vaccinology approach facilitates an easier and productive process of vaccine candidates determination the outcomes from this very significant analysis could help selecting sars-cov-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines soon this novel research will certainly pave the way for a fast reliable and virtuous platform to provide timely countermeasure of this dangerous

qia985831 and qiapgqtgkiad and ilpdpskpskrs from surface glycoprotein qhs345461 vaccine is one of the most important and extensively produced pharmaceutical products millions of infants and people are getting vaccinated every year however the development and research processes of vaccines are costly and sometimes it takes many years to develop an appropriate vaccine candidate against a pathogen in modern times various tools and methods of immune-informatics bioinformatics and reverse vaccinology are extensively used for vaccine development which save time and cost of the vaccine development process 8 22  in current study the physicochemical study revealed that surface glycoproteins qia985831 and qhs345461 had the highest extinction co-efficient of 148960m-1 cm-1 and 147470 m-1 cm-1and

antigenic determinant portion 31  the allergenicity is defined as the ability of that substance to act as allergen and induce potential allergic reactions within the host body 32  moreover the cluster analysis of the mhc class-i alleles and mhc class-ii alleles were also carried out to identify their relationship with each other and cluster them functionally on the basis of their predicted binding specificity 15  in the next step the peptide-protein docking was carried out between the selected epitopes and the mhc alleles the mhc class-i epitopes were docked with the mhc class-i molecule pdb id

also analysed by hpepdock server based on global energy gvyfastek and nfrvqptesi generated the best scores in the peptide-protein docking respectively all the vaccine candidates were proved to be potentially antigenic and non-allergenic for this reason they should not cause any allergenic reaction within the host body however more in vitro and in vivo researches should do to finally confirm the safety efficacy and potentiality of the predicted vaccines candidates in the face of the enormous tragedy of suffering death and social disaster caused by covid-19 pandemic it is of utmost importance to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this highly pandemic disease bioinformatics reverse vaccinology and related technologies are widely used in vaccine design and development since these technologies reduce the cost and time in this study first the potential proteins belong to sars-cov-2against host human country india are identified further the potential b cell and t cell

justified as a powerful tool for identifying new vaccine candidates and their consequent precise application this study will lead the research in a new and effectual direction and the outcome of our study will provide a fast reliable and significant platform in search of effective and timely cure of this dangerous pandemic disease covid-19 caused by sars-cov2   middle east respiratory syndrome obstacles and prospects for vaccine development amy papaneri b reed johnson f jiro wada laura bollinger peter jahrling b jens kuhn h   high-consequence pathogens continue to emerge or re-emerge globally leading to increased public health concerns about potential pandemics 1 current human viral disease outbreaks of concern include an ongoing ebola virus disease epidemic in west africa 2 avian influenza caused by a novel influenza a virus subtype h7n9 in china 3 enterovirus d68 infections in the usa 4 and the topic of this review middle east respiratory syndrome mers caused by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 2012present 5 emerging infections often first present as limited disease outbreaks caused by rare or unknown pathogens increasing the likelihood that their significance is overlooked consequently financial resources are routed toward other infectious diseases that are deemed more pressing at a given time examples of rare agents that caused very few human infections for many years only to then erupt in outbreaks involving thousands are rift valley fever virus more than 100000 cases from 1930 to 2015 6 and ebola virus 1581 cases and 1136 deaths since its discovery in 1976 until late 2013 24701 cases and 10194 deaths from december 2013 to march 18 2015 2 other agents such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov emerge unexpectedly and eventually cause large epidemics 8096 cases and 774 deaths only to seemingly disappear again 7 consequently global public health professionals are challenged with the ever more important task of rapidly developing improved methods for infectious disease detection surveillance control prevention and containment through widespread efforts to provide a swift response to an emerging disease mers an impressive spectrum of prevention and treatment strategies was established in vitro in a relatively short period of time from antivirals to monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and vaccines 818 in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing led us to the same predicament that the scientific community faced during the sars epidemic laboratory research is all too often inefficiently translated into clinical testing of candidate therapeutics and prophylactics delaying clinical licensure by the authorities and final administration during outbreaks here we summarize and evaluate the progress made in mers vaccine development to provide an example of various challenges that are encountered on the path to medical countermeasure licensure mers was first recognized as a new disease in a 60-year-old saudi male patient with respiratory distress admitted to a hospital in jeddah saudi arabia in june 2012 19 soon after the index case was detected more and more people were identified who suffered of the same ailment 2021 the majority of mers infections were reported from western asia in particular from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates but also from jordan lebanon kuwait oman qatar and yemen later mers was also diagnosed in europe austria france germany greece italy the netherlands uk northern africa algeria egypt tunisia northern america usa south-eastern asia malaysia philippines and southern asia iran among people with a travel history to western asia 5 human-to-human transmission of mers-cov is estimated to account for approximately 60 of the total mers cases 22 and the origin of infection with mers-cov is unexplained in the rest of the cases the risk of virus transmission is substantially greater from index cases than from secondary cases 22 the increasing distribution of mers cases within the arabian peninsula is worrisome for instance for the past 2 years concerns about the initiation of a mers pandemic prompted travel restrictions to makkah saudi arabia for millions of muslim pilgrims preventing tens of thousands of potential travelers from making the religiously significant hajj journey although a major outbreak of mers has not occurred as a direct result of recent hajjes trepidations remained high 2324 studies revealed that older men and individuals with comorbid conditions eg diabetes hypertension chronic cardiac lung or renal disease are at greatest risk for developing fatal mers although the gender bias is epidemiologically unclear 202529 whether physiological genetic or cultural factors play a role in the increased risk toward men is unknown at the time of writing 1075 mers cases were confirmed including at least 404 deaths 5 however increasing evidence of subclinical infections 30 suggests that the actual number of human mers cases is much higher than the currently confirmed number the etiological agent of mers a novel betacoronavirus was rapidly identified and named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 193132 how mers-cov was originally introduced into the human population and why mers cases were not recorded before 2012 remain to be determined one-humped camels camelus dromedarius are currently suspected to be the animals from which mers-cov is transmitted to humans this suspicion stems from the detection of mers-covneutralizing antibodies in one-humped camel herds of egypt 33 ethiopia 34 kenya 35 jordan 36 nigeria 34 oman 37 qatar 36 saudi arabia 3839 somalia 40 spain 37 sudan 40 tunisia 34 and united arab emirates 4142 mers-cov or mers-covlike genome fragments and coding-complete genomes highly similar to human mers-cov genomes were detected in one-humped camels 38394349 and mers-cov was directly isolated from several one-humped camels and grown in tissue culture 394950 one-humped camels experimentally infected with mers-cov develop only minor clinical signs of respiratory disease but mers-cov replicates in the upper airways 51 serologic evidence for mers-cov infection was not found in people with potential exposure to infected one-humped camels in three serosurveys 395253 therefore zoonotic transmission from one-humped camels to people might be a rare event however such a conclusion should be regarded with caution until further serosurveys are performed and published it is therefore possible that mers-cov is widely distributed among one-humped camels but that particular genotype of the virus had to evolve to allow a jump into the human population a genomic study indeed revealed the presence of several genetic variants of mers-cov in individual one-humped camels whereas mers-cov in humans exposed to these one-humped camels appears to be infected with clonal mers-cov populations 44 as one-humped camels are frequently exported from africa to the arabian peninsula of western asia an animal native to africa could be transmitting mers-cov to one-humped camels prior to exportation figure 1 based on the presence of genome fragments genomes or replicating viruses many betacoronaviruses seem to be maintained in africa europe and asia by phylogenetically highly diverse bats these viruses include sars-cov and sars-covrelated viruses from horseshoe bats rhinolophus spp 54 but several viruses even more closely related to mers-cov have not been detected in humans 5563 therefore researchers speculate that mers-cov could be a bat-borne virus the bat-origin hypothesis is based on betacoronavirus phylogeny and receptor usage 55566467 and isolation of mers-cov from one individual egyptian tomb bat taphozous perforatus 66 however these studies are suggestive and epidemiological evidence of bat-to-human or bat-to-one-humped camel transmission of mers-cov figure 1a has yet to be gathered 68 after an incubation period of 912 days mers generally presents in humans as a lower respiratory infection with fever often with chills or rigors dry or productive cough and dyspnea more infrequently patients develop chest pain headaches hemoptysis myalgia andor sore throat in severe cases the illness can quickly progress to severe atypical pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe hypoxemic respiratory failure 2026282969 mers often includes extrapulmonary manifestations involving the circulatory renal andor gastrointestinal systems abdominal painnausea diarrhea emesis that can rapidly advance to septic shock renal failure or refractory multiple organ failure 202870 chest x-ray or computed tomography imaging often reveals subtle to extensive unilateral or bilateral abnormalities such as consolidation increased bronchovascular markings pleural or bronchial wall thickening reticulonodular airspace opacities or cardiomegaly clinical chemistry is characterized by increased alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase concentrations in some patients and increased l-lactate dehydrogenase concentration in about 50 of the cases low albumin and hemoglobin concentrations are frequent findings as are lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia whereas lymphocytosis occurs more rarely 2026282969 viral loads are usually high in the respiratory tract reaching 106 genome copiesml but may be low or absent in the blood 286970 at the moment specific antiviral agents for the treatment of mers are not available however several in vitro studies identified drugs already in clinical use that potentially could be repurposed for treatment of mers these drugs include an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor mycophenolic acid used to treat other coronavirus infections 131516 a pan-coronavirus inhibitor that targets membrane-bound coronaviral rna synthesis k22 71 the guanosine analog ribavirin used in the treatment of hepatitis c respiratory syncytial virus and arenavirus infections interferon- 131672 inhibitors of estrogen receptor 1 used for cancer treatment toremifene citrate inhibitors of dopamine receptors used as antipsychotics chlorpromazine hydrochloride and triflupromazine hydrochloride kinase signaling inhibitors imatinib mesylate and dasatinib 12 endocytosis inhibitors chlorpromazine and chloroquine 18 an antidiarrheal agent loperamide the hiv-1 protease inhibitor lopinavir 18 and the transmembrane protease serine 2 protease inhibitor camostat 73 unfortunately few of these drugs have been evaluated in animal models of mers an exception is 72 which in part is due to the absence of animal models that truly reflect the human disease see below in the absence of approved specific antiviral agents against mers-cov treatment therefore is based on supportive care after initial laboratory blood tests and chest radiography patients are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to control often nosocomial secondary bacterial infections however the majority of in-patient mers cases escalate to respiratory failure requiring intubation mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy and therefore admission to an intensive care unit 2026282969 treatment and disease management for mers can be a tremendous financial burden to local economies in the event of a pandemic the financial burden may prove to be catastrophic especially in countries with limited financial resources based on the small number of treatmentcost analyses available from the 2003 outbreak of sars 7475 at tourcoing hospital france additional hospital administration and material resource costs alone approximated us79150 per in-patient due to the need for increases in staff containment apparatuses and personal protective equipment required when dealing with a high-consequence pathogen moreover the average mers in-patient incurs the added costs of a prolonged intensive care unit stay 945 of cases with mechanical ventilation 86 of cases and renal replacement therapy 50 of cases figure 2 the world bank estimates global economic losses of trillions of us dollars in the event of a severe influenza pandemic and considers mers to be a pathogen of pandemic potential 14 global costs for the 2003 sars epidemic alone were estimated at us40 billion 76 the cost of developing a successful vaccine is approaching us500 million an effective vaccine for a high-consequence pathogen has the potential to save 10 times its cost in a single year of use as estimated for the smallpox vaccine however a true cost-to-benefit analysis must be performed to determine if vaccine development efforts will provide benefit if we assume that mers cases continue at the rate of roughly 450 per year with a 62 hospitalization rate 77 and that the additional cost per in-patient is approximately us714000 on average cumulative average cost per day per intervention per in-patient multiplied by median stay per respective intervention the cost of developing the vaccine would be justified within 25 years figure 2 therefore if sustained human-to-human mers-cov transmission were to occur the benefit would outweigh the cost in general vaccine development is a worthwhile pursuit and steps should be taken to expedite approval of safe and effective vaccines for emerging pathogens the emergence of mers-cov infection has spurred a conglomeration of traditional and novel vaccine strategies the success of which hinges on a thorough understanding of the genetic makeup and mechanism of action of this virus mers-cov is a member of the genus betacoronavirus subfamily coronavirinae nidovirales coronaviridae 78 like all nidoviruses mers-cov has a positive-sense single-stranded rna linear monopartite genome the mers-cov genome encodes 16 nonstructural proteins 4 major structural proteins and 7 accessory structural proteins table 1
31 the nonstructural proteins produced through proteolytic cleavage of two polyproteins coded from two open reading frames are the major components of the polymerase complex and manage replication and transcription similar to many other coronaviruses the major structural proteins spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleoprotein n are the primary targets of the host antibody-mediated immune response and are the focus in vaccine development efforts s is the surface glycoprotein of the mers coronavirion s mediates the attachment of the virion to target cells and its subsequent entry into the cell by fusing viral and host cell membranes 79 these functions involve two distinct domains of s referred to as s1 and s2 respectively s1 contains the host cell receptor-binding domain 428081 which engages the primary mers-cov cell-surface receptor cd26dpp4 11 s2 contains epitopes that are cross-reactive with homologous epitopes of other group a and b betacoronaviruses 7982 suggesting that the development of a general multivalent betacoronavirus vaccine might be possible the e and the m work to secure the structural integrity of the virion the nucleoprotein n encapsidates the viral genomic rna 83 the identification of the natural host reservoir of an emerging human pathogen is the first ideal step toward prevention of transmission then the human population could be educated to avoid the host or to implement proper safety measures when coming in contact with the reservoir if contact with the reservoir host cannot be avoided eg abundance economic importance vaccination of such a host may be a straightforward approach to prevent host-to-human transmission in addition the development of an animal vaccine may ultimately be cheaper to produce and faster to achieve as regulatory hurdles to obtain licensure may not be as stringent as those in place for human vaccine development for example vaccination of wildlife reservoirs against rabies reduced human cases in the usa by 98 84 this strategy is also a relatively new pursuit for the eradication of tuberculosis in parts of europe through vaccination of cattle and wildlife 8586 unfortunately as described above the natural mers-cov reservoir and the mers-cov transmission cycle remain to be defined vaccination of one-humped camel herds could be feasible as these animals are often keptraisedsold by humans and wild animals could be identified relatively easily however some adult one-humped camels tested positive for mers-cov despite the presence of anti-mers-cov antibodies 3839 and pre-existing neutralizing anti-mers-cov antibodies do not necessarily protect against re-infection with mers-cov 39 this observation suggests that camel vaccination may have to be repeated regularly or may not be effective at all probably even more unrealistic is the vaccination of bats due to sheer number of these relatively small and dependent on species often quite abundant animals the absence of a clearly defined zoonotic virus ecology prompts researchers to contemplate development of human vaccines as mers tends to be acute and is not yet widespread targeting specific human populations at high risk of infection for vaccination is a logical strategy for prevention or limitation of infections development and distribution of vaccines should therefore be expedited for one-humped camel handlers and herders healthcare workers and veterinarians and travelers to areas where mers-cov infection is prevalent if widespread infection throughout the general population is expected other high-risk populations eg aged people persons with cormorbidities should be targeted for vaccination given the lack of a suitable mers animal model and relatively few clinical data on mers-cov patients the nature of a successful immune response to mers-cov infection is difficult to establish serology and pcr-based assays indicate that many people may test positive for mers-cov despite being asymptomatic 253087 it is unknown if all of the asymptomatic positive individuals were transiently exposed established a carrier state or developed a subclinical easily controlled infection few human patient data are available however faure et al performed an ex vivo comparison of two mers patients to determine the immune response to infection 88 the experiment was based on bronchoalveolar lavages obtained from two patients and identified that the one who succumbed to mers did not develop a th1 response this patient had lower concentrations of interferon- interleukin-12 and interferon- compared to the patient who did not succumb although the experiment involved a limited sample size the data support the necessity of a th1 response zhao et al investigated knockout mice to evaluate the immunological requirements of clearance of mers-cov 89 the authors demonstrated that interferon- and myd88-deficient mice could not clear mers-cov as rapidly as wild-type mice similarly t-cell and b-cell knockout mice could not clear the virus as efficiently as control mice furthermore vaccinated mice had reduced viral titers and serum transfer experiments provided protection against homologous mers-cov infection these data suggest that both an efficient t- and b-cell response are required for protection indirect or direct b- and t-cell functional response should be included as criteria for candidate vaccine evaluation until more clinical data become available correlates of protection will be difficult to establish historically the first vaccines against viral pathogens were homotypic live-attenuated viruses the virus isolate was passaged in an animal host or cell line until a nonvirulent live-attenuated strain evolved and this nonvirulent virus was then used for vaccination 90 a more recent method for developing vaccines is to genetically engineer the virus to be avirulent or replication incompetent 9192 replication-deficient vaccine virus constructs were generated that expressed human parainfluenza virus-3 or human respiratory syncytial virus 9394 similarly replication-deficient adenoviruses were developed as vaccines against ebola virus and hiv-1 infection 9596 a phase iia clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of a replicating modified vaccinia ankara mva expressing influenza a virus proteins 97 replicating mva has also been used to boost the effect of replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccine responses 98 the main concern with replicating live viral vaccines is the possibility of disseminated infection in immunosuppressed populations eg disseminated vaccinia virus infection with heterotypic vaccine platforms or the possibility of reversion to virulence in the case of homotypic candidates 99 new methods of replicating vaccine development typically incorporate fail-safe mechanisms such mechanisms include deletion of a gene encoding a protein required for viral propagation or introduction of a sufficient number of genomic mutations to make reversion extremely unlikely 91100 for instance almazan et al engineered a recombinant mers-cov lacking the e open reading frame as a mers candidate vaccine however its protective efficacy has not yet been demonstrated 101 whole inactivated virion preparations often provide the immunogenicity of a replicating viral vaccine without the possibility of reversion to a virulent phenotype virions are killed or inactivated by chemical or radiological methods prior to use in a vaccine while the preparation is not able to replicate in the host the recipients immune system still mounts a response against the presented antigens although examples of inactivated mers-cov virions are not yet published inactivated sars-cov particle vaccines have been tested with minimal success in laboratory mice and domestic ferrets 102104 use of inactivated virion preparations has prompted several concerns one concern is that toxic reagents used in virion inactivation must be completely removed from the product before administration another concern is that irradiation used as an alternative to toxic agents may destroy crucial epitopes and therefore render the preparation nonimmunogenic the third concern is that inactivation could be for whatever reason incomplete resulting in preparations containing fully virulent viruses these concerns are exacerbated by the increasing stigma that exists among the general public regarding vaccines in general and chemical additives in vaccine preparations in particular 105106 recombinant viral vectors are an upgrade to the replicating viral vaccine strategy the ability to optimize for safety and immunogenicity via bioengineering is an obvious benefit using vaccine platforms such as adenoviruses 107 vesiculoviruses 108 or mva 109112 the foreign gene of immunological interest can be inserted into a heterotypic viral genome with proven success as a vaccine the recombinant virus will express the foreign protein which will stimulate a protective immune response in the inoculated host this approach has also been used successfully to develop multivalent vaccines such vaccines can confer protection against not only multiple variants or strains of the same pathogen but also multiple pathogens simultaneously 98113115 recently escriou et al showed evidence of bivalent protection of laboratory mice from measles virus and sars-cov infection 115 for such constructs codon optimization for host recognition may increase attenuation and protein expression yielding greater safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine for instance two vaccines an mva vaccine and an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing codon-optimized mers-cov s elicited serum antibodies in laboratory mice that were used to neutralize mers-cov in vitro
111116 as an alternative method to immunogen presentation by a viral vector nanoparticles of the protein of interest can be formulated with a suitable adjuvant for use as a candidate vaccine for instance micellular nanoparticles with mers-cov s trimers expressed on the surface novavax inc gaithersburg md usa were concentrated from preparations of a recombinant baculovirus autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus acmnpv expressing mers-cov s the acmnpv genes were codon-optimized for expression in the insect cells in which the virus was propagated 117 again mers-covneutralizing antibodies were induced in immunized laboratory mice dna vaccines typically consist of a viral genomic segment encoding a neutralizing epitope contained in a plasmid and combined with an adjuvant for administration 118 while early fabrications failed to yield protective immune responses more recent studies testing dna vaccines corrected this shortcoming by optimizing constituents and delivery methods also due to the relatively simple and low-cost processes for production and manufacturing dna vaccines are a competitive pursuit one such dna vaccine a quadrivalent vaccine against hpv infection caused by types 6 11 16 and 18 is widely used in vaccination programs in numerous countries 119123 unpublished data from inovio pharmaceuticals suggest strong neutralizing antibody elicitation possible multiple strain coverage and broad cd8 t-cell responses in mice after immunization with a mers-cov dna vaccine inovios proprietary technology involves using the syncon dna vaccine platform inovios proprietary technology involves using the syncon dna vaccine platform this platform incorporates dna from multiple strains andor antigens the dna is transfected by electroporation resulting in a more efficient delivery into muscle or skin cells 124 other novel vaccine development strategies of interest use immunoinformatics to predict the most immunogenic parts of a virus that should be included in a vaccine to achieve the most potent and relevant neutralization the resulting candidate vaccines are also known as subunit vaccines current mers candidate vaccines focus on the receptor-binding domain of s1 as a precise source from which the adaptive immune response would generate effective neutralizing antibodies 404281 using immunoinformatics sharmin and islam chose to focus on an epitope found in rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp that is conserved across all human coronaviruses 125 while blocking viral replication by affecting the rdrp may be effective in vitro this method has yet to be proven effective in protecting a host from infection by an rna virus one drawback to this approach is that the rdrp epitopes may not be readily detected by the host immune system as the rdrp is usually not a major structural component of virions also antigenic processing should lead to a wide range of t-cell and b-cell immunoreactive epitopes therefore focusing on rdrp epitopes would not provide broad effective cellular and humoral responses in combination with the aforementioned immunoinformatics technology a more realistic approach is based on the use of b-cell and t-cell epitope predictions based on viral genome sequence neutralizing antibodies to mers-cov structural proteins primarily s are believed to be required to inhibit infection 81111116117 in addition to humoral immunity t-cell responses are now considered to be a major determinant of protection from infectious diseases 126127 such an approach using b-cell and t-cell epitopes was used by researchers such as terry et al and oany et al to develop a mers candidate vaccine 128129 while this approach is innovative no actual in vivo mers-cov neutralization has been demonstrated to date the evaluation of any candidate vaccine against a high-consequence viral disease is critically dependent on the availability of animal models the us fda animal rule permits use of efficacy data from animal models that closely mimic human disease for approval of medical countermeasures when evaluation in humans is not ethically feasible due to the high lethality of the virus under evaluation 130 to the best of our knowledge the fda has not determined that mers medical countermeasure development falls under the animal rule however the identification and development of a suitable animal model for any human disease has many challenges and caveats upon exposure to mers-cov animals should display respiratory distress fever tussis dyspnea gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting and diarrhea and renal failure 202629 since mers-cov was first identified several groups have attempted to develop such mers animal models laboratory mice syrian hamsters mesocricetus auratus and domestic ferrets mustela putorius furo were evaluated as potential models for medical countermeasure screening and for understanding mers-covinduced pathogenic mechanisms 117131 initial experiments included screening of wild-type balbc and stat-1 knockout laboratory mice for susceptibility to mers-cov infection and development of disease however the mice did not develop clinical signs of disease and infectious virus could not be recovered 117 zhao et al overcame this hurdle by transducing balbc mice with human cd26dpp4 using an adenovirus construct 89 transduced mice were permissive to mers-cov infection and demonstrated minimal weight loss however candidate medical countermeasures in this mouse model can only be evaluated by comparing the changes in viral titer in the lungs at 4 days post-inoculation between treated and untreated animals transduction-based models may also prove quite variable due to infection efficacy of the transducing vector nonhuman primates such as rhesus monkeys macaca mulatta crab-eating macaques macaca fascicularis grivets chlorocebus aethiops or common marmosets callithrix jacchus are frequently used in the development of animal models for human viral disease because of their immunological similarity to humans mers-cov inoculation into rhesus monkeys gave varied results leading to disease with limited similarity to human disease 72132133 for instance a study by yao et al revealed that intratracheal inoculation of rhesus monkeys with mers-cov resulted in a nonlethal disease and some limited pathology could be observed at 28 days post-inoculation 133 de wit et al described a study of nonhuman primates following inoculation with a combination of intratracheal intranasal oral and conjunctival routes 132 rhesus monkeys were euthanized on days 3 and 6 post-inoculation with mers-cov and evaluated for virological immunological and histopathological changes 132134 at the euthanasia time points the animals had signs of pneumonia and replicating virus could be demonstrated in tissues and mucous membranes by quantitative pcr however inherent in the serial-sampling design the disease progression induced by viral infection was truncated limiting the data gleaned from the study a follow-up study by falzarano et al demonstrated that administration of anti-inflammatory immunomodulators interferon-2b and ribavirin reduced the viral burden and lessened disease severity following intratracheal intranasal oral and ocular challenge with mers-cov 72 x-ray radiographs indicated lung infiltrates at days 3 and 5 post-inoculation suggesting virus-induced lung disease however these two studies did not include mock-inoculated controls to demonstrate that the observed clinical signs were not due to generalized inflammation from inoculation and handling procedures more recently falzarano et al described intratracheal inoculation of common marmosets with mers-cov which resulted in partially lethal disease 135 however the animals received a large volume bolus of mers-cov 05 ml intratracheally which was disproportionate based on the small lung volume 1525 ml of a common marmoset johnson rf unpublished observation measured by computed tomography n  10 in addition the experiment did not include animals that only received control inocula therefore the extent of virus-induced pathology compared to pathology due to animal manipulation remains unclear overall a suitable nonhuman primate model of human mers is still lacking if one-humped camels are the reservoir of mers-cov see above then their vaccination against mers-cov infection may provide an intervention opportunity figure 1b indeed three one-humped camels inoculated by intranasal intratracheal and conjunctival routes with mers-cov developed benign clinical signs but shed large quantities of the virus from the upper respiratory tract 51 comparisons drawn from a uniformly lethal animal model against this one-humped camel model would be interesting a mers animal model based on one-humped camels has many challenges the large size of these animals their relative scarcity in the western world and the classification of mers-cov as a who risk group 3 pathogen requiring biosafety level 3 bsl-3 containment limit the number of facilities that could perform such studies colorado state university kansas state university united states department of agriculture ames ia usa and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation commonly known as csiro clayton south australia all have bsl-3 labs that could handle such large animals an alternative is the use of other camelids such as alpacas vicugna pacos guanacos lama guanicoe llamas llama glama or vicuas vicugna vicugna as these camelids are smaller and may be easier to obtain than bactrian camels camelus bactrianus such camels are as big as one-humped camels and rarer however the consequence of mers-cov inoculation in these animals requires evaluation the recent emergence of mers-cov and the re-emergence of several other high-consequence pathogens in recent years have spurred a retooling of current vaccine strategies and development procedures many current mers vaccine development strategies are based on sars research 136 however in the 11 years since the first description of sars no vaccine to prevent sars-cov infection has been approved this fact does not bode well for researchers and clinicians while researchers are not deficient in mers candidate vaccines more emphasis should be placed on improving translational research licensure procedures and animal model development for emerging pathogens 89133 for transient outbreaks of infectious diseases such as mers that appear to subside relatively quickly on their own justification of funding and research efforts for vaccine development is not always straightforward unfortunately vaccine development often seems reactionary rather than prospective for instance vaccine development against ebola virus disease was overall a niche activity until the current 20132015 outbreak affected thousands of people for any rare or emerging pathogen costbenefit analyses for vaccine development must be calculated based on a limited knowledge of its pandemic andor re-emergence potential as the example of mers-cov shows even with sparse economical data available cost estimates as shown in figure 2 warrant mers vaccine development as economic losses from even small infectious disease outbreaks far outweigh the costs associated with vaccine development however faster methods to move a candidate vaccine from the laboratory bench into the clinic are essential such on-demand acceleration strategies are in current evaluation and support for these efforts should be advanced 137139 in light of the 2014 ebola virus disease outbreaks added efforts to accelerate clinical trials regulatory filings and licensure approvals will affect vaccine development for high-consequence pathogens in future companies like novavax and inovio pharmaceuticals have an advantage of established pipelines for developing an approved mers vaccine a mers wildlife vaccine targeting one-humped camels should also be evaluated considering the encouraging rate at which new technologies are being developed for emerging pathogen treatment strategies a licensed mers vaccine is feasible within 5 years after an appropriate mers animal model becomes available a typical timeline for vaccine development by the manufacturer prior to regulatory submission is approximately 375 years figure 3  rapid response research to emerging infectious diseases lessons from sars b finlay brett raymond see h robert brunham c   throughout human history infectious diseases have had an important role in shaping and evolving our world pandemics and epidemics have been commonplace as the density of the worlds population and international travel and trade have increased to support the global spread of pathogens microbial pathogens are constantly evolving and new pathogens are continually emerging from nature the recent emergence of many new pathogens including hiv enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli west nile virus legionella pneumophila cryptococcus neoformans subspecies gattii and various influenza a strains is actually biology taking its normal course as microorganisms evolve to exploit new or altered ecological niches12 therefore it is no surprise that the first pandemic of the twenty-first century appeared quickly late in 2002 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov causing significant morbidity approximately 8500 cases and mortality 774 deaths and had an estimated economic impact of us 90 billion worldwide3 the sars outbreak provided an excellent opportunity to attempt to harness the power of modern science to provide rapid solutions to a public health emergency and placed pressure on many microbiologists worldwide to identify and sequence the virus characterize the disease apply modern epidemiological techniques to track and trace the virus and its origins and develop strategies to treat and control the pathogen worldwide scientists responded to these challenges with extreme vigour and many achievements were made fig 1 including identifying the causative agent sequencing its genome developing animal models of infection and determining where the pathogen originated in nature and how it was globally spread in human communities however despite the acquisition of this large body of scientific information as sars was spreading around the world a method of controlling the virus was required in case it escaped containment measures this meant that alternative therapeutic and preventative methods were urgently needed the development of vaccines and other therapeutic agents usually takes at least a decade and costs hundreds of millions of dollars yet a practical solution for sars was needed before the beginning of the next respiratory virus season in addition other new microbial threats are likely to emerge and scientists will again be asked to provide rapid solutions so a fast and successful response to sars could provide an example of how science can be effectively applied in response to other new and emerging diseases unfortunately the usual scientific process is not designed to be focused on quickly solving a practical problem grant applications peer review and funding mechanisms are traditionally not rapid processes responding to emerging infectious diseases of pressing public health importance requires a scientific process that is significantly different from traditional procedures such a response must focus the science directly on a practical solution to the problem and solve several scientific problems in parallel instead of in sequence the sars pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to attempt to develop such a system 
a savi solution to sars
 with the emergence of sars many scientific groups worldwide began to study the disease canada was particularly affected by sars  there were 438 cases 44 deaths and a world health organization who travel health advisory was issued  and therefore had a strong interest in the pandemic34 the michael smith genome sciences centre in vancouver had an emergency management plan in place that allowed the entire facility to be dedicated to the rapid sequencing of an infectious agent in collaboration with the british columbia centre for disease control and health which supplied the sars clinical virus strain known as toronto 2 or tor-2 this centre generated the first genome sequence of the sars-cov within six days of receiving the viral nucleic acid5 several other groups followed with other genome sequences shortly thereafter67 the key to sequencing the genome so quickly was having a rapid response emergency management plan already in place this entailed a top-down management approach to be taken with team members in parallel projects able to dedicate their time and expertise to their assigned tasks this success coupled with the concern that in canada quarantine would not contain the sars-cov led to the provincial british columbia government providing cdn 26 million in april 2003 to establish the sars accelerated vaccine initiative savi that was dedicated to developing a human sars vaccine as rapidly as possible a vaccine approach was chosen for several reasons including previous success with animal coronavirus vaccines the ease of product development and the use of vaccines to prevent infection in cases of defined risk exposure such as healthcare workers in hospitals savi was established to apply rapid response research to a public health issue it was designed with only one goal  to develop a safe and effective human sars vaccine as rapidly as possible all savi-funded vaccine-development initiatives were evaluated with this goal in mind a senior management committee was established that had significant expertise in animal coronavirus vaccines and epidemiology clinical trials and grant-funding mechanisms an emergency management strategy was adopted with weekly teleconferences between all members as well as regular management committee discussions parallel research strategies were designed with vaccine development as the ultimate goal so in addition to identifying vaccine candidates immunological assays clinical trials regulatory affairs and international collaborations were all developed in parallel instead of sequentially as soon as the genome became available a bioinformatics web site was created which was used by savi scientists as well as many other sars researchers around the world see sars bioinformatics suite in the online links box in addition there was a large demand worldwide for full-length sequenced clones of the various sars coronavirus genes several programmes were put in place to clone and express viral proteins that could be used both as reagents and in vaccine studies methods were developed for growing the virus in tissue culture using vero cells and a neutralization assay was developed both of which were necessary for vaccine development an important factor in producing a vaccine quickly is the early availability of information about the basis for immunological protection against disease although the immune correlates for protection against sars-cov are not yet completely defined individuals convalescing from sars are known to develop high titres of neutralizing antibodies8 the appearance of these neutralizing antibodies coincided with the onset of resolution of sars pneumonia910 and as with other coronaviruses11 there is an inverse relationship between disease severity and the levels of pre-existing serum antibodies so neutralizing antibodies are likely to be important in protection against sars t-cell immunity is also likely to be necessary for protection from sars as it is for many other viruses for instance low concentrations of cd4 and cd8 t cells during a sars infection are correlated with increased disease severity and mortality12 and specific human leukocyte antigen hla class i alleles have been correlated with sars susceptibility13 taken together the data indicated that a vaccine for sars would need to induce neutralizing antibodies and possibly cd4 and cd8 t-cell responses this knowledge proved helpful in selecting vaccine candidates and immunization approaches there are many potential vaccine strategies that can be considered for the sars-cov including a whole killed viral vaccine an attenuated virus such as adenovirus or vaccinia virus expressing sars proteins recombinant sars proteins or dna vaccines successful vaccines have been developed for animal coronaviruses indicating that one or more of these strategies might work information about which sars proteins could be used as candidate vaccine antigens was also obtained from the development of other animal coronavirus vaccines14 these include the spike s surface glycoprotein that is found on the viral surface giving the viral particle a crown and therefore its name and the nucleocapsid n protein that is found inside the viral particle and which packages the rna viral genome fig 2 deciding on which antigens and which vaccine approach to use posed significant challenges as each has both advantages and disadvantages most research groups chose a particular vaccine method that they were familiar with by contrast savi chose to develop three vaccine approaches in parallel only making the final decision on which candidate should progress to human clinical trials after a direct comparison of the three vaccines in relevant animal infection models this strategy also provided the opportunity to use more than one vaccine in a prime-boost strategy if necessary although this approach initially required more work it was thought that it would significantly increase the likelihood of a successful vaccine being developed so work began on the three strategies developing whole killed inactivated virus developing a recombinant s protein and modifying adenovirus and vaccinia virus to express the sars-cov s and n proteins both whole killed virus and recombinant s protein were targeted at inducing neutralizing antibodies whereas the adenovirus and vaccinia virus vectors were targeted at inducing both cellular immunity and neutralizing antibodies as the main goal of savi was to expedite vaccine development only approaches and adjuvants that were already approved for use in humans were used in the studies despite the potential advantages of many newer adjuvants15 and technologies such as dna vaccines16 that were not approved by the us food and drug administration fda using this rapid response model savi scientists were able to develop three vaccine candidates within six months these candidates are now being tested in ferret and mice models of sars with results of vaccine efficacy expected by mid-july 2004 another important consideration in vaccine testing is the availability of a relevant animal infection and challenge model when the vaccine studies were initiated there were no animal models available but it was assumed that they would be developed quickly as rapid vaccine development was the ultimate goal it was decided assuming they became available to initially test the vaccine candidates in the most relevant animal infection model possible  non-human primates small-animal vaccine models can be misleading and time consuming soon after a macaque infection model was published1718 and significant efforts were made to secure primates for these studies however recently there have been significant concerns that primate models are not the best infection models and tests in many laboratories indicate that they only exhibit mild respiratory infections19 at present ferrets seem to be the most relevant disease model20 and relevant murine models have been developed that allow viral replication21 owing to the high costs of doing primate experiments in biosafety level iii containment facilities and the concerns about the relevance of a primate challenge model at present savi vaccines are first tested in ferrets and mice and then in non-human primates or other small animals for safety and immunogenicity similarly other groups are testing adenoviruses22 modified vaccinia viruses23 and a dna vaccine24 in both murine and macaque models although this additional step adds time to the project it is necessary and imperative to show protection in an animal infection model that closely mimics human disease it was anticipated that testing in multiple animal models would also help eliminate concerns regarding vaccine-induced immune enhancement or immunopathology14 
rapid response issues raised
 in addition to the fundamental scientific questions associated with vaccine development there are several related issues that impacted directly on the success of the project fig 3 intellectual property to successfully commercialize a vaccine a strong intellectual property position is needed25 savi was fortunate in that it is partnered with the group that sequenced the sars-cov and they protected the genome sequence5 however additional intellectual property issues will arise as the project progresses and there will also be pre-existing intellectual property in place that must be incorporated such as the use of live attenuated vectors or protein expression systems savi decided to not make itself a legal entity but to leave the ownership of intellectual property with the inventors and their home universities this saved significant time as intellectual property mechanisms are already established at the various partner universities and issues such as royalty rates are already settled an appropriate way to deal with intellectual property remains a significant challenge worldwide for the development and commercialization of sars vaccines regulatory issues regulatory issues are another consideration when rapidly developing a vaccine vaccines often take many years to develop yet the need for a sars vaccine was urgent so at the beginning of the initiative discussions were held with the appropriate regulatory bodies health canada and the us fda to gain their support and obtain documents describing regulatory guidelines for biological agents in addition savi worked with regulatory authorities and consultants to define the steps that were needed for vaccine development including the use of clinically approved cell lines for vaccine generation avoidance of animal products for vaccine production identification of plasmids and vectors suitable for human vaccines understanding the vaccine manufacturing process under good manufacturing practice gmp and an understanding of what was needed to file a pre-investigational new drug application for vaccines it was important to establish exactly what was needed and to begin to solve these issues quickly difficult questions arise when one attempts to obtain rapid approval for a vaccine for example can clinical trials take place in a country such as china where sars is prevalent and still be approved for use in north america can the trials be expedited who should the vaccine be tested on  healthcare workers who are at risk in a hospital setting or an at-risk community population what happens if the number of sars cases decreases such that there is not a population that is at risk from sars on which the vaccine can be tested as is currently the case the regulatory agencies in canada and the united states were extremely supportive and willing to work according to a riskbenefit platform and if sars had developed into the next major pandemic they would have done everything possible to expedite the approval process to counter the risk of disease now that sars is currently not a major threat most agree that normal regulatory approval mechanisms should apply and expediting vaccine approval might be unnecessary handling the media any major disease outbreak receives significant media attention and there is a continual demand for updates about research progress into potential therapeutics and preventatives such as vaccines therefore mechanisms need to be in place to deal responsibly with media requests as these projects progress consequently a system was established that enabled effective communication with the media as needed and provided a consistent message that handled but did not expand expectations and provided important messages about the progress of the project media briefings were also provided every six months scientific symposia were held every six months to keep the entire savi group of collaborators abreast of progress being made in different areas of the project funding mechanisms an important hurdle in rapid response research is distributing funds to researchers in a timely manner the timeframe from starting to write a peer-reviewed grant application to when funds are received in the laboratory is usually more than one year which is unsuitable for rapid response research so rapid funding mechanisms must be established to ensure that appropriate research is carried out in a timely manner when savi was established the michael smith foundation for health research the provincial health research funding agency in british columbia was used to control and dispense the research funds using a five-member senior management committee consisting of senior scientists a rapid review mechanism was established short 2-page focused research proposals together with a proposed research budget which dealt directly with aspects of vaccine development were solicited and accepted from the research community the committee reviewed and evaluated the projects on the basis of scientific merit and the direct need for the project and funds were dispersed to successful applicants immediately  usually 24 hours after the application was submitted while ensuring that applications were peer-reviewed this rapid review process significantly enhanced the speed of the project and proved important in bringing together disparate research communities into a common effort researchers who obtained funding are still held accountable to standard grant regulations and research guidelines including adequate accounting and reporting on completion of the project a project director periodically reviews progress with each of the funded collaborators to ensure adequate progress and relevance as well as coordinating diverse research groups international collaboration and vaccine development as sars was a pandemic international coordination and collaboration was essential the who had an important role in coordinating responses during and following the epidemic in addition in october 2003 the who hosted a meeting in geneva that was attended by nearly all of the main research groups working on the sars-cov and sars vaccines this meeting was useful in many respects including allowing the various groups to discuss strategies and progress resolving intellectual property and regulatory issues and selecting and developing animal models several additional collaborations were formed at this meeting as well as a better understanding of where the world stood with regard to vaccines more recently in february 2004 the who held a meeting in rotterdam to reach a consensus regarding which animal models represent the best infection models to test sars vaccine candidates although a macaque model has been described for sars17 there were still questions regarding its suitability for vaccine testing at least three north american laboratories have had little success in observing lung pathology and severe clinical signs in macaques after live sars-cov challenge19 factors such as the dose or strain of sars-cov the route of administration and the day of autopsy might account for the variability between the laboratories the consensus at the who meeting in rotterdam was that standardization of conditions for sars-cov challenge was needed in the different laboratories before non-human primates could be used for vaccine testing some strains of mice such as balbc and c57 have been shown to support sars-cov replication but do not demonstrate significant pathology or clinical disease21 other small-animal models for sars such as ferrets20 and hamsters unpublished observations at the who meeting in rotterdam 2004 ref 19 also support viral replication and demonstrate some level of pathology that is similar to humans these animals offer an alternative inexpensive disease model compared with non-human primates although reports on the use of these small animals for sars-cov vaccine testing is scarce however despite these different animal models no single animal species has been shown to reproduce all of the clinical signs and lethality that is observed in humans that are infected with sars-cov anticipating that a re-emergence of sars would be most likely to occur close to its original site of origin savi initiated a collaboration with chinese scientists in guangdong province in southern china this resulted in a bilateral agreement to work together on sars vaccine trials this collaboration was greatly facilitated by strong political support from both china and canada two countries that were significantly affected by sars the most obvious question is how sars vaccines will be evaluated for human efficacy given the lack of human sars cases globally this year ordinarily phase i to phase iii human clinical trials are designed to provide an understanding of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in humans as well as identification of correlates of immunity without an outbreak of sars that could be used to test the efficacy of the vaccines in humans licensure of the vaccine under emergency conditions might have to take place under the fdas animal efficacy rule which states that vaccines or other biological agents can be licensed if they meet two criteria human safety and the demonstration of adequate protection against a deliberate infection challenge in two species of animals see vaccine policy in the online links for the sars vaccines to go directly from animals to humans under these conditions vaccine efficacy and safety must be evaluated in animals followed by phase i safety evaluation and immunogenicity testing in healthy human volunteers such a phase i study is currently ongoing in china with an inactivated sars virus19 at present there are not enough sars cases to test the vaccine further in phase ii and iii trials despite the lack of an ongoing sars threat rapid response initiatives such as savi will continue to be necessary as it is important to have a vaccine available should sars return furthermore such initiatives are strongly supported by internationally recognized scientists each with a strong expertise in a particular area of research and development this is in contrast to pharmaceutical companies where product focus is more diffuse and the expertise is suitable for gmp vaccine manufacturing and organizing clinical trials in humans 
rapid response lessons learned
 the ability to do rapid research in response to an emerging infectious disease has significant appeal as sars was seen as a major public health threat in canada and several countries in asia these countries in particular felt compelled to act collaboration and cooperation experiences in canada indicated that the concept of working together in rapid response research towards a sars vaccine was rapidly accepted by all researchers who were approached in fact other scholars from the non-life-science areas of academia also freely offered their time and skills to deal with related problems all scientists were willing to contribute their relevant expertise and a portion of their laboratorys resources to work towards a common goal with no particular individual gain immediately obvious although this willingness is probably accentuated when one perceives a significant threat to ones country it is also a powerful motivating factor when seeking to obtain particular expertise during rapid response research similarly international cooperation and coordination are needed to avoid significant duplication and redundancy of efforts as well as to share progress in an ideal situation expertise around the world would be coordinated but this poses major logistical and political challenges the who had a pivotal role throughout the sars pandemic not only in tracking the disease but also by convening meetings of researchers working on potential vaccine therapeutics and diagnostics in the face of future pandemics a coordinated international rapid response research approach will be essential to develop new ways of controlling these scourges a main difficulty with sars research was the limited availability of clinical samples to researchers and the standardization of such samples some countries had national centres for disease control that collected and coordinated clinical samples whereas in others it was left to the individual hospitals an important problem with studying emerging infectious diseases that was exemplified by sars is patient consent when clinical samples are taken especially early during the outbreak the potential research uses of such samples are not known and it is difficult to specify exactly what they will be used for however having a large collection of clinical samples is crucial to understanding an infectious disease and mechanisms for collecting and sharing such samples must be in place before an outbreak occurs manufacturing considerations for any vaccine or therapeutic product to be used in human clinical trials it has to be made under stringent gmp26 ideally all rapid response research would be done under such conditions from the start but this is nearly impossible especially with infectious agents instead once a candidate vaccine or therapeutic is identified the work has to be reproduced under such conditions which significantly lengthens the production time at the outset if standardized cell lines such as vero cells attenuated viral vectors such as adenovirus and adjuvant alum are chosen that are already approved for human use significant time can be saved in product development1526 sars is particularly challenging as it requires biosafety level iii containment all animal studies must be done in stringent containment facilities of which there are only a few in the world similarly if a whole killed viral vaccine is to be manufactured highly specialized biosafety level iii gmp facilities are needed again few of which exist worldwide27 owing to the perceived threat of biological agents several biosafety level iii containment facilities have recently been approved for construction however performing rapid response research on highly infectious agents that are new to the world places a major burden on such specialized facilities especially biosafety level iii large animal primate and gmp facilities efficient use of such space requires global cooperation and judicial prioritization commercialization commercialization of a sars vaccine raises several complex issues as it seems that sars is not a worldwide threat at present there is not a significant commercial market so vaccine companies are unwilling to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars that are needed to commercialize a vaccine as they are unlikely to recover their expenses28 there are several reasons why industry is unwilling to commit to developing specific vaccines first the huge cost of vaccine development up to us 500 million and the small and uncertain revenue from traditional vaccines have made vaccine manufacturers wary of investing in development and production scale-up second the lack of understanding of some diseases and the complexity of the science involved in producing the appropriate immune response for vaccines are also a deterrent finally consumers are more willing to pay for treatment than prevention this is one reason why vaccines represent less than 2 of the world pharmaceutical market2829 the solution to this problem is the establishment of public healthbiotechnology industry partnerships public and private sectors need to work together to ensure a winwin system for vaccine development governments can help support vaccine development in several ways set up public-sector laboratories and research facilities to help reduce research and development costs sponsor human clinical trials to reduce costs and help acceleration of the product to market set up tax credits to stimulate research and development in selected areas set up public sector advocacy to stimulate demand and purchase large volumes or stockpiles of vaccines which would help reduce market uncertainty2829 companies provide valuable expertise in areas such as gmp production facilities and clinical trials and are therefore poised to take products further down the commercialization route successful contracts have been established between the us national institutes of health nih and two vaccine companies to produce gmp-grade whole-killed vaccine that the nih can test in phase i human clinical trials this should be ready for use in about one year although often difficult to structure partnerships between corporate entities and research agencies are crucial to move findings from rapid response research forward into clinical practice 
concluding remarks
 many valuable lessons were learned from the sars pandemic research methodologies are significantly improved and the application of rapid response research to sars demonstrated that it is possible to rapidly identify a new pathogen sequence its genome and develop preventative therapeutic and diagnostic approaches within a very short time frame fig 1 although it required a slight redirection of researchers and resources the response to sars has shown that there are ample mechanisms available to use emergency management procedures and apply them to rapid response research with a direct goal in mind2730 although one cannot predict where or what the next pandemic will be we know with certainty that there will be more we need to learn from our research experiences with sars and put the mechanisms and models in place to allow us to effectively respond rapidly to such threats by so doing we will be in a much better position than just relying on quarantine isolation and infection-control precautions which may or may not contain the outbreak these approaches will provide the world with new and better ways to control emerging infectious diseases in a just-in-time fashion  vaccines to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-induced disease luis enjuanes marta dediego l enrique lvarez damon deming tim sheahan ralph baric   severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus sars-cov marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 sars was detected for the first time in the guandong province of china in late 2002 spread

declared the end of the sars outbreak in july 5th 2003 nevertheless several isolated outbreaks subsequently occurred because of accidental contaminations in laboratories of taiwan singapore and mainland china httpwwwwhointcsrsarsen in late 2003 and early 2004 newly infected persons who had contact with animals infected with sars-cov strains significantly different from those predominating in the 20022003 outbreak were reported in guandong china peiris et al 2004 these events indicate that a sars epidemic may recur at any time in the future although this event most likely would require the generation of new isolates evolving from sars-cov-like virus circulating in animals jiang et al 2005 as a consequence of this possibility and because sars-cov could be used as a biological weapon it has been declared as a category c priority pathogen by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases biodefense httpwww2niaidnihgovbiodefensebandc priorityhtm sars-cov infection results in severe acute respiratory disease pneumonia diarrhea and sometimes death peiris et al 2003 sars-cov is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier most likely originating from bats and has been amplified in other species preferentially civets lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 woo et al 2006 the sars-cov like viruses that exist in animals do not cause typical sars-like disease in the natural host and are not easily transmitted from animals to humans under certain conditions the virus may have evolved into the early human sars-cov with the ability to be transmitted from animals to humans and from humans to humans resulting in localized outbreaks and mild human disease jiang et al 2005 in fact the virus most likely crossed the species barrier before the 2002 outbreak as sera samples collected in 2001 were positive in 18 of the cases zheng et al 2004 furthermore 40 of animal traders whereas only a 5 of vegetable traders in guandong markets were seropositive for sars-cov without showing signs of disease guan et al 2003 sars-cov vaccines are urgently needed to prevent potential sars epidemics as sars-cov disease severity has been linked to age with higher mortalities for ages over 45 special attention should be paid to vaccine development to protect elderly people several types of vaccines are being developed including inactivated viruses subunit vaccines virus-like particles vlps dna vaccines heterologous expression systems and vaccines derived from sars-cov genome by reverse genetics this paper will review previously published sars vaccination strategies and announce new accomplishments in sars-cov based vaccination approaches while focusing on the correlates of protection detected serotypes vaccination side effects and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the sars-cov genome knowledge on the diversity of serotypes is essential information for vaccine design phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov isolates from animals and humans strongly suggest that the virus originated from animals most likely bats lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 poon et al 2005 was amplified in palm civets and transmitted to human population via live animal markets kan et al 2005 the neutralization of a set of eight pseudoviruses expressing the spike glycoprotein of eight sars-cov strains selected from the three phases of

al 2005 human monoclonal antibodies against the s protein of the frankfurt isolate fra-1 derived from epstein-barr virus transformed b lymphocytes were used the virus tested in the neutralization assays included pseudotypes made with the s protein from members of the four main genetic clusters defined with the bayesian analysis of the sars-cov glycoproteins fig 1a deming et al 2006igroup 1 originating from animals isolated in 2003 a prototype of this group is the isolate sz16 which primarily uses civet but not human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptoriigroup 2 low pathogenic viruses originating from civets raccoon dogs or sporadic human cases such as strain gd03 reported from a sporadic sars case in december 22 2003 this virus represented an independent

 basically all virus pseudotyped with s proteins from different strains were neutralized to the same extent except the human gd03 and the two civet cat isolates sz16 and sz3 indicating that there were at least two human sars-cov serotypes most likely originated from two independent transmissions of the virus from civet cat to human baric et al 2006 yang et al 2005 it will be important to determine if recombinant viruses bearing zoonotic s glycoproteins display similar neutralization kinetics as pseudotyped viruses bearing sars spikes the sars-cov-like isolated from bats identified in rhinolophus spp has a nucleotide identity with tor-2 strain higher than 92 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 in addition six novel coronaviruses from six different bat species have been described woo et al 2006 four of these coronaviruses belong to group 1 and two of them to group 2 based on sequence data these authors have proposed the classification of bat cov in three subgroups 2a 2b and 2c subgroup 2b comprises both sars-cov and a bat-sars-cov rp3 isolate the sequences of these sars-cov isolates differ in the s1 domain of the s protein where sequence identity fell to 64 this sequence divergence in the s1 domain corroborated the serum neutralization studies which indicate that although bat sera have a high level of cross-reactive antibodies they failed to neutralize human or civet cat sars-cov when tested in vero e6 cells li et al 2005 in contrast other authors lau et al 2005 have reported that 42 of the bat sera samples tested neutralized human sars-cov isolate hku-39849 using frhk-4 cells the discrepancy could be due to the presence of a different sars-cov-like virus serotype in the bats studied by the two different groups or to the two test systems used in the evaluation consequently vaccine design should take into account this antigenic diversity interestingly recent characterization of the antigenic structure of sars-cov s protein with a large panel of mabs has shown that at least one epitope providing susceptibility to sars-cov that maps in the rbd for ace-2 is highly conserved in most virus strains and therefore may confer protection to most sars-cov strains he et al 2006 sars-cov has at least seven structural proteins s 3a e m 7a 7b and n fig 2
 huang et al 2006 schaecher and pekosz 2006 weiss and navas-martin 2005 sars-cov s 3a e and m proteins are viral membrane proteins with domains exposed to the external face of the virus ito et al 2005 shen et al 2005 that in principle could be involved in protection by induction of neutralizing antibodies it has been shown that proteins s and 3a induce in vitro sars-cov neutralizing antibodies with s protein being the main component of protective immunity qiu et al 2005 saif 2004 although strong immune responses are elicited against both s and n proteins buchholz et al 2004 subbarao et al 2004 wang et al 2005 zhu et al 2004 passive transfer studies illustrate that only s-specific antibodies confer protection from sars-cov replication in the mouse model bisht et al 2004 subbarao et al 2004 the relevance of s protein in protection against sars-cov has been reinforced by the identification of neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients the majority of the coronavirus neutralizing epitopes are located within the spike protein of the virus buchholz et al 2004 hogan et al 2004 two domains are defined in the spike protein the amino-terminus s1 and the carboxy-terminus s2 halves in some coronaviruses but apparently not in the case of sars-cov the s protein is processed in these two halves weiss and navas-martin 2005 wong et al 2004 recent evidence has determined that sars-cov neutralization is sensitive to deglycosylation of the spike protein suggesting that conformational epitopes are important in antibody recognition song et al 2004 the rbd located in the s1 subunit of s protein contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes this suggests that recombinant proteins containing rbd and vectors encoding the rbd sequence can be used to develop safe and effective sars vaccines jiang et al 2005 the continuous viral epitopes targeted by antibodies in plasma samples from convalescent sars patients have been identified by biopanning with a m13 phage display dodecapeptide library zhong et al 2005 these epitopes converged to very short peptide fragments one on each of the spike nucleocapsid 3a 9b and nsp3 proteins immunoassays found that most of the patients 82 that recovered from sars developed antibodies to the epitope-rich region on the spike s2 domain indicating that this domain also is an immunodominant site on the s protein these s2-targeting antibodies were shown to effectively neutralize sars-cov moreover it is possible that s2-specific antibodies provided protective immunity to help the patients recover from viral infection zhong et al 2005 in fact among the rabbit antibodies elicited by different fragments covering the entire s protein expressed in e coli some of them were specific for aa 10291192 which include the heptad-repeat sequence of the s2 domain that interacts to form s protein trimers and had neutralizing activities indicating that this region of the s protein also carries neutralizing epitopes sars-cov 3a protein consist of 274 amino acids contains three putative transmembrane domains and is expressed on the virus and cell surface ito et al 2005 tan et al 2004b the topology of 3a protein on the cell surface was experimentally determined the first 34 aa located before the first transmembrane domain are facing the extracellular matrix akerstrom et al 2006 and its c-terminal after the third transmembrane domain aa 134274 is facing the cytoplasm tan et al 2004b interestingly in two separate cohorts of sars patients one from taiwan liu et al 2004 and the other from hong kong zhong et al 2005 b cells recognizing the n-terminal region of 3a protein were isolated from patients moreover significant proportion 40 of the convalescent sars patients examined in a dot blot assay using a synthetic peptide with a sequence corresponding to amino acids 1227 of the n terminus of the protein were positive zhong et al 2005 in addition it was recently reported that the n-terminal domain of 3a protein elicits strong and potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients zhong et al 2006 accordingly rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 1528 of 3a protein inhibit sars-cov propagation in vero e6 cells in contrast to antibodies specific for the c-terminal domain of the protein akerstrom et al 2006 sars-cov e m and 7a proteins have shown low immunogenicity tan et al 2004a sera from three convalescent phase sars patients do not recognize these proteins expressed in mammalian cells accordingly sars-cov e protein peptides were not recognized by convalescent patient antisera using a protein microarray qiu et al 2005 in a study using rabbit antibodies to 13 recombinant fragments associated with sars-cov s e m n 3a 3b 6 7a and 9b proteins strong neutralizing antibodies were only elicited by the s1 fragment aa 241591 of s protein qiu et al 2005 the incorrect folding of the proteins expressed in e coli could be responsible for the lack of detection of antibodies to other viral proteins such as the 3a protein that is known to induce neutralizing antibodies see above the m protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev is required for virus assembly and budding and m protein specific antibodies significantly but weakly neutralize tgev and mediate complement-dependent lysis of tgev infected cells delmas et al 1986 risco et al 1995 woods et al 1987 consistent with the tgev data described above it has been shown that sars-cov m protein also induced virus neutralizing antibodies in the absence of complement buchholz et al 2004 in addition a mixture of s and m proteins showed a synergistic effect in the in vitro synthesis of tgev neutralizing antibodies by immune leukocytes anton et al 1995 in the case of sars-cov immunization of hamsters with a parainfluenza virus vector has shown a differential role of s m e or n proteins in protection buchholz et al 2004 parainfluenza virus expressing s protein alone provided complete protection against sars-cov challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract this protection was slightly augmented by co-expression with m and e proteins buchholz et al 2004 nevertheless expression of m e or n proteins in the absence of s protein did not confer detectable protection these results identify s as a main sars-cov neutralization and protective antigen among the structural proteins and confers a limited role to sars-cov m protein in protection sars-cov n protein specific antibodies do not neutralize the virus in vitro as it could be expected for an internal virus protein pang et al 2004 however sars-cov n protein induces t-cell responses gao et al 2003 accordingly dna immunization using sars-cov n gene induces potent th1 polarized immune responses in mice as well as specific antibodies in these animals in fact the highest levels of humoral response and t cell proliferation activity were induced by the n gene construct jin et al 2005 analysis of the immune response to another coronavirus tgev using an in vitro antibody synthesis system has shown that the optimum combination of viral proteins to stimulate the production of tgev neutralizing antibodies in vitro was a mixture of s and n proteins or a combination of s protein oligomers rosettes and the n or n protein-derived peptides anton et al 1996 anton et al 1995 these data in principle suggest that n protein could be used in a vaccine to promote the synthesis of s-specific neutralizing antibodies 9b protein 98 aa elicits antibodies in sars-cov patients indicating that it is expressed in natural disease and that it is immunogenic qiu et al 2005 zhong et al 2005 in fact 100 of convalescent phase patients sera were positive for 9b protein based on this data it has been speculated that 9b protein could be structural qiu et al 2005 nevertheless the presence of 9b protein in sars-cov virions needs to be further proved in summary with the available data sars-cov proteins s and 3a elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses whereas protein m only induces a reduced neutralizing humoral immune response these antigens probably are relevant in the protection against sars-cov in addition other structural proteins such as e m 7a 7b and n and possibly protein 9b could also play a role in protection to study the role of the humoral immune response to sars-cov spike specific monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the virus have been developed berry et al 2004 subbarao et al 2004 traggiai et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 passive transfer of these monoclonal antibodies or immune serum into nave mice protected them from infection with sars-cov subbarao et al 2004 using epstein-barr virus transformed human b cells the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from sars-cov infection has been rescued traggiai et al 2004 some of the monoclonal antibodies exhibited neutralization activity in vitro and some of them also conferred protection in a mouse model of sars-cov infection in addition human igg monoclonal antibodies neutralizing sars-cov developed using phage display libraries protected ferret from lung disease and virus shedding in pharyngeal secretions ter meulen et al 2004 in both mouse and ferret models administration of human monoclonal antibodies with in vitro neutralization activity reduced sars-cov titers in the lungs 3 to 6-log10-unit protecting from lung pathology in ferrets ter meulen et al 2004 overall these data indicate that humoral immune responses alone can protect against sars immune responses to sars-cov elicited by a dna vaccine encoding a codon optimized sars spike protein yang et al 2004 or the s1 fragment induced neutralizing antibodies zeng et al 2004 as well as t-cell responses nevertheless protection from sars-cov challenge was mediated by a humoral immune response but not by a t-cell-dependent mechanism yang et al 2004 surprisingly immunodeficient mice can clear a sars-cov infection showing the role of innate immune responses in the defenses against sars-cov c57bl6 mice that lack nk-t cells cd1 or nk cells or those that lack t and b cells ragl cleared the virus by day 9 after infection glass et al 2004 and displayed high induction of proinflammatory cytokines these data suggest that the nk cells and the adaptative immune response were not essential for virus clearance in mice possibly interferon pathways were relevant in viral clearance the importance of interferon response was reinforced by infecting stat1-deficient mice with sars-cov hogan et al 2004 stat1 is important to the regulation of interferons and stat1-deficient mice produced one hundred-fold increase in viral titer over control mice additionally the mutant mice developed interstitial pneumonia not seen in control mice hogan et al 2004 but not alveolar damage as seen in lungs of human patients it is unclear at this time if the observed pathological differences between human and stat 1-deficient mouse lungs were due to time of sampling or to differences in host responses hogan et al 2004 neutralizing antibodies were detected 23 weeks after the onset of disease in immunocompetent sars patients and 90 of patients recovered without hospitalization ksiazek et al 2003 these data indicate that most patients successfully respond to sars-cov infection although many types of vaccines for sars-cov have been attempted such as expression of recombinant proteins or the use of virus vectors these vaccines require considerable research set-up time bradbury 2003 therefore the classical approach using inactivated cell-culture based sars-cov is likely to be the easiest way for sars vaccine development based on the experience with available vaccines including inactivated or live polio and rabies vaccines montagnon 1989 zhou et al 2005 this is the case of companies that favored the development of an inactivated candidate whole virus vaccine based on the well-established technologies for the development of such vaccines spruth et al 2006 the fast spreading of sars initially prompted a chinese company sinovac biotech of beijin to develop a vaccine in collaboration with the chinese academy of medical sciences that started tests of the vaccine an inactivated form of sars-cov as early as 2004 using 30 volunteers marshall and enserink 2004 no side effects were reported for the first patients that were injected with the inactivated virus sars-cov inactivation to produce the killed vaccines has been performed using different methods for instance sars-cov purified by ultracentrifugation has been inactivated with -propiolactone and administered with or without alhydrogel as adjuvant see et al 2006 the virus subcutaneously administered to mice was more efficient than recombinant adenoviruses expressing either the s or n proteins provided by the intranasal or intramuscular routes an alternative method was the inactivation of sars-cov by -propiolactone before initiating the purification step immunization with this virus was compared with vaccination using dna or adenovirus vectors the humoral immune response was most effective using inactivated virus with adjuvants such as mf59 chiron vaccines or alum pierce rockkford il and was associated with stimulation of the cd4 but not the cd8 response supporting the use of inactivated sars-cov as vaccine kong et al 2005 sars-cov has also been purified up to 98 homogeneity by ultrafiltration gel filtration and exchange chromatography and inactivated with -propiolactone cynomolgus macaques were immunized with different amounts of the purified virus in the absence or in the presence of adjuvant monkeys were challenged by the nasal route 30 days post-immunization high levels of neutralizing antibodies that prevented the replication of sars-cov and interstitial pneumonia were induced qin et al 2006 interestingly no side effects were observed even in the presence of low titer neutralizing antibodies indicating that the purified sars-cov vaccine is safe in monkeys in other approaches sars-cov partially purified in sucrose cushions was completely inactivated with formaldehyde this virus efficiently competed the binding of infectious virus to cells indicating that the inactivated virus kept a functional rbs qu et al 2005 polyethyleneglycol precipitated virus alone or in the presence of cholera toxin b ctb sigma or cpg administered to mice by the intranasal route elicited serum sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies and iga specific antibodies in the trachea and lungs qu et al 2005 in another approach formaldehyde inactivated whole virus prepared in vero cells was used in intramuscular immunization of 25 year-old rhesus monkeys zhou et al 2005 after 3 weeks monkeys were challenged with sars-cov doses of 05 or 5 gmonkey protected most of the monkeys against challenge with 108 pfu of sars-cov and higher doses 50 g conferred complete protection in contrast the control animals developed a typical sars-cov infection after challenge the immunization preferentially induced th1 responses but also enhanced other cellular immune responses including the production of ifn- that can increase the activity of natural killer cells and inhibit virus replication no systemic side effects were observed in vaccinated animals post-immunization even at the high dose 5000 gmonkey and after two injections one vaccine manufactured to large scale using fermenter cultures of vero cells in serum free medium has been based in a double-inactivated whole virus vaccine spruth et al 2006 virus infection at a moi of 0001 resulted in generation of high viral titers around 108
 tcid50ml culture supernatants were harvested and inactivated by formalin treatment followed by uv inactivation this two step inactivation procedure was utilized in order to ensure a high safety margin with respect to residual infectivity mice immunized twice with l g of sars-cov vaccine using adjuvant 02 aluminium hydroxide developed high antibody titers against sars-cov spike protein as determined by an elisa test the use of the adjuvant aloh3 had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine in addition cell mediated immunity as measured by the production of inf- and il-4 stimulation was elicited the vaccine confers 100 protection that was correlated to antibody titer against the sars-cov s protein and to neutralizing antibody titer induction of neutralizing antibodies with titers 114 and an s-specific elisa titer 25600 resulted in 100 protection against intranasal challenge with 105 tcid50 of infectious virus a polypeptide containing amino acids 14762 of the sars-cov spike protein has been expressed using the baculovirus system bisht et al 2005 the affinity purified protein was administered to mice with either saponin or ribi as adjuvants both regimens induced binding and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies although the best results were obtained with saponin and polypeptide which provided the highest antibody response after challenge protective immunity was shown by the reduction of sars-cov titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract this subunit vaccine induced higher neutralizing antibody and more complete protection against an intranasal challenge than that achieved by inoculation of mice with live sars-cov subbarao et al 2004 vaccinia virus ankara mva expressing the full length s protein bisht et al 2004 or dna expressing the full-length s or s protein lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains yang et al 2004 n protein by itself does not provide protection against sars-cov infections still a large number of reports using n protein as an antigen have been published the immune response of mice vaccinated with a purified n protein fused to glutathione s-transferase gst was analyzed and compared with the response of two dna-based vaccination approaches gupta et al 2006 the immunization with n-gst elicited a strong t-cell il-4 and antibody responses but minimal ifn- response this response differed markedly with the immune response shown by mice immunized with both dna encoding unmodified cytoplasmic n protein and dna encoding n as a lamp-1 chimera targeted to the lysosomal mhc ii compartment dna immunizations elicited a strong t-cell ifn- and ctl responses nevertheless the t-cell responses to the three immunogens were elicited by the same n peptides as shown by the elispot analysis of antigen-activated t cells in vivo protection experiments were not performed with these vaccines the n protein of sars-cov was expressed in e coli and purified liu et al 2006 balbc mice were vaccinated with n protein emulsified in montanide isa-51 containing the oligodeoxynucleotide cpg or in pbs in the first case anti-n antibodies were found to be mainly igg2a suggesting a prevalence of th1 immune response in contrast anti-n protein antibodies of mice immunized with n protein in pbs were found to be mainly igg1 reactivity of antisera raised against n protein formulated in isa-51cpg in mice and monkeys and that of sera from patients were tested with a panel of overlapping peptides the region around residues 156175 of n protein is immunogenic in the three models in addition peptides corresponding to residues 130 86100 306320 and 351365 contained murine immunodominant t-cell epitopes using and ifn- secretion cell assay peptides containing residues 8195 were capable of stimulating cd4 and cd8 cell proliferation in vitro peptides corresponding to residues 336350 were capable of stimulating inf- production in t-cell cultures derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs of macaques immunized with the n protein emulsified in isa-51cpg no protection experiments were performed with this immunogen the requirements for sars-cov vlp formation differs using different expression systems and cell types production of viral proteins in insect cells using baculovirus has shown intracellular sars-cov vlps assembly by expressing m and e proteins ho et al 2004 secretion of these vlps to the extracellular media required the co-expression of s protein mortola and roy 2004 in these experiments secretion of vlps was relatively efficient 200 g per 1  109 infected cells these results are at variance with those obtained by expressing sars-cov proteins in human 293 renal epithelial cells under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter using dna plasmids huang et al 2004 in this system any combination of genes that expressed m and n proteins with or without s or e proteins generated intracellular vlps and the pseudoparticles did not form in the absence of the m and n proteins no single viral gene was able to support the formation of viral capsids within these cells the additional expression of the s protein allowed the formation of budding particles with morphology typical of sars and related coronaviruses different types of vlps could be formed depending of the protein composition of these sars-cov vlps protection by the administration of vlps has not been reported the development of plant-based vaccines against different coronaviruses tgev infectious bronchitis virus ibv and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv using the oral delivery of recombinant s protein that elicit protective immunity has been reported bae et al 2003 lamphear et al 2004 tuboly et al 2000 zhou et al 2003 one of these studies include a s protein plant-based vaccine candidate against tgev that has advanced into early phase farming trials tuboly et al 2000 more recently to develop a safe effective and an inexpensive vaccine candidate the s1 domain of sars-cov s protein has been expressed in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants pogrebnyak et al 2005 high expression levels of recombinant s1 protein 01 total soluble protein were observed in several transgenic lines by western blot analysis using s protein specific antibodies plant-derived antigen induced systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice which showed significantly increased levels of sars-cov specific iga after oral ingestion of tomato fruits expressing s1 protein pogrebnyak et al 2005 sera of mice parenterally primed with tobacco-derived s1 protein revealed the presence of sars-cov-specific igg several approaches based on dna vaccination have been described in order to elicit protection against sars two of them used prime-boost strategies and showed that the combination of the dna vaccine and the whole chemically inactivated vaccine can be used to enhance the magnitude of the immune response and also to change the balance of humoral to cellular immune response zakhartchouk et al 2005a a combination of the dna and inactivated virus induces th1 immune responses while the whole killed virus vaccine induces th2 immune responses mice immunized intramuscularly with a dna vaccine expressing s protein and intraperitoneally boosted with e coli expressing s peptides showed high neutralization titers 11280 this vaccine might have a practical value to immunize in farms growing civet cats due to its low cost woo et al 2005 other dna vaccines express n protein alone or linked to calreticulin the first ones preferentially induce igg responses of the igg2a isotype ifn- and il-2 and cd8 ctl responses to n protein but produce strong delayed-type hypersensitivity dth that could have undesired side effects zhao et al 2005 the expression of n protein linked to calreticulin increases major histocompatibility complex mhc class i presentation to cd8 t cells in the absence of reported adverse effects in mice kim et al 2004 these vaccines led to the generation of strong n-specific humoral and t-cell-mediated immune responses in mice but no protection experiments were shown n protein has also been expressed linked to hlamp n-hlamp that target antigen to the mhc class ii leading to a stronger and higher memory cellular immune response associated to high ifn- production than immunization with n protein alone gupta et al 2006 studies on dna immunization to protect against sars using three forms of the spike protein full-length s and s proteins with the cytoplasmic or the transmembrane domains deleted have been reported yang et al 2004 these vaccines induced neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses resulting in protective immunity in mice viral replication was reduced more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these s plasmid dna expression vectors protection was mediated by a humoral but not a t-cell dependent immune mechanism as shown by adoptive t-cell transfer in which donor t-cells were unable to reduce pulmonary viral replication in recipient animals by contrast passive transfer of purified igg from immunized mice but not control igg provided immune protection against sars-cov yang et al 2004 the vector expressing the s protein with the cytoplasmic domain partially deleted induced the most potent neutralizing antibody response using the highly attenuated modified mva sars-cov s protein has been expressed by several groups bisht et al 2004 chen et al 2005 the first one has shown that intranasal or intramuscular immunization of balbc mice elicited protective immunity as shown by the reduction of sars-cov titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract after challenge furthermore passive transfer of serum from mice immunized with the recombinant mva expressing s protein to nave mice also reduced the replication of sars-cov in the respiratory tract after challenge demonstrating a role for s protein specific antibodies in protection the second group chen et al 2005 showed the induction of neutralizing antibodies in mice ferrets and monkeys although protection experiments were not performed in an antibody absorption assay the majority of the antibodies raised by the mva recombinant expressing the full-length s protein were absorbed by an s protein fragment including aa 400600 that includes the rbd indicating that the major sars-cov neutralization mechanism likely occurs through blocking the interaction between the virus and the cellular receptor ace2 in contrast other authors immunized ferrets using mva expressing the sars-cov s protein inducing a vigorous immune response that did not prevent virus infection and spreading czub et al 2005 weingartl et al 2004 liver inflammation was found in all mva-spike vaccinated ferrets these authors suggested that their results indicate the induction of antibody dependent enhancement ade of disease similar to that caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv sars vaccines based on the use of adenovirus vectors have shown that expression of s protein alone or in combination with n protein led to the protection of mice against the challenge with sars-cov the efficacy of immunization with adenovirus vectors was compared with that of chemically inactivated partially purified virus whole-killed virus vaccine was more effective in conferring protective immunity against live sars-cov see et al 2006 other adenovirus vaccines tested in mice have expressed either the s or the n protein zakhartchouk et al 2005b and shown that the s2 domain and the n protein contain strong t-cell epitopes but reported no challenge experiments in the monkey model adenovirus-based vaccines induce strong sars-cov-specific immune responses indicating that these vectors are promising vaccine candidates but again no information on protection have been provided gao et al 2003 the adenovirus ad5 vector with a deletion in the e1 and e3 regions have also been used to express the s1 domain of the sars-cov s protein 490 aa liu et al 2005 wistar rats immunized three times throughout consecutive weeks produce antiserum capable of protecting from sars-cov infection in cell culture histopathological examination found no evident side effects in the immunized animals nevertheless in vivo protection experiments were not performed therefore additional experiments are required with the adenovirus based sars vaccines severe disease and high death rates were noted in senescent human populations infected with sars-cov while children under 12 years of age did not develop the severe disease that was seen in adults baric et al 2006 deming et al 2006 ng et al 2004 these data suggest that the quality of the immune response may play a role in the outcome of virus infection the ability of vaccines to induce robust immune responses in senescent populations has been evaluated to determine if protection can be elicited in elderly populations with senescent immune systems to evaluate vaccine efficacy against homologous and heterologous strains the urbani s glycoprotein and nucleocapsid genes were inserted in vee virus replicon particles vrp-s or vrp-n baric et al 2006 deming et al 2006 in addition expression of the influenza a ha glycoprotein vrp-ha was used as a control using reverse genetics synthetically resurrected recombinant viruses bearing the gd03 s glycoprotein that replicated to high titers in vero and human airway epithelial cells have been obtained baric et al 2006 deming et al 2006 importantly human convalescent sera had plaque reduction neutralization titre of 50 prnt50 values of about 11600 against late phase isolates like urbani yet were reduced about 1015 fold against the heterologous icgd03 virus prnt50 1150 fig 3a young and senescent balbc mice with ages exceeding 1 year at the time of challenge were vaccinated with vrp-ha vrp-s vrp-n or a combination of vrp-s and vrp-n and challenged with recombinant sars-cov expressing the urbani s protein or the antigenically different gd03 s protein fig 3b in vaccinated animals vrp-s vaccines provided complete short- and long-term protection against homologous challenge protecting both young and senescent mice from the urbani strain replication after challenge vrp-s and vrp-s  vrp-n vaccinated mice displayed little if any pathologic lesions in the lung whereas vrp-ha vaccinated aged mice demonstrate pathological lesions in the lung similar to that reported in the literature roberts et al 2005a vrp-s vaccines also provided short-term protection in young mice challenged with the heterologous gd03 s strain despite the significantly reduced ability of anti-urbani s antibody to neutralize virus expressing gd03 s in contrast vaccination of senescent mice with vrp-s provided limited protection 38 and the combination of vrp-s  vrp-n vaccines provided little long-term protection against infection by the antigenically different sars-cov gd03 although virus titers were reduced about 10-fold compared with vrp-ha controls the sars-cov gd03 challenge also produced pathological lesions in both the vrp-ha and sars-vaccinated animals that were virtually indistinguishable from those produced by infection with the sars-cov-urbani strain therefore it is likely that declining immunity of senescent animals in combination with the reduced ability of antibody to neutralize heterologous challenge viruses resulted in vaccine failure in aged animals it seems that vaccine approaches that induce less robust neutralization responses like dna and killed vaccines might completely fail in protecting senescent populations against sars-cov gd03 challenge sars-cov disease severity was linked to age and other co-morbidities with mortality rates increasing with age and exceeding 50 in individuals over 65 it is also known that elderly respond poorly to new antigens as compared to younger populations but overall this phenomena is poorly studied consequently vaccine efficacy in the elderly is a key property of efficacious sars-cov vaccines immunosenescence is common in animal models and in clinical studies that occur during aging and vaccine efficacy is often attenuated in the elderly frasca et al 2005 song et al 1997 zheng et al 1997 immune complications include a generalized decrease in the function of b and t cell and innate immune function diminished macrophage and granulocyte function diminished cellular traffic cell growth and differentiation and decreased natural killer cell numbers and activity new and different vaccine regimens should be developed and tested with the ultimate goal of eliciting complete protection against antigenically heterologous forms of sars-cov especially in the most vulnerable elderly populations and that there is a need for further testing developing vaccines that induce an anti-n response in more animal models similarly to what has been described in other viral systems frech et al 2005 mcelhaney 2005 a vector based in an existing live attenuated parainfluenza virus that is being developed for intranasal pediatric immunization against human parainfluenza virus type 3 hpiv3 was used to express sars-cov s protein bukreyev et al 2004 vector administration to monkeys resulted in the production of systemic immune response by mucosal immunization after challenge with sars-cov all monkeys in the control group shed sars-cov in contrast no viral shedding occurred in the group immunized with the parainfluenza vector expressing the s protein recombinant viruses expressing sars-cov structural s m and n proteins individually or in combination have been evaluated for immunogenicity and protection in hamsters that support the replication of both sars-cov and parainfluenza vector buchholz et al 2004 a single intranasal administration of the vector expressing the s glycoprotein induced a high titer of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies only two fold lower than that induced by sars-cov infection this response provided complete protection against sars-cov challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract in contrast expression of m n or e proteins did not induce detectable serum sars-cov neutralizing antibodies a recombinant rabies virus vector has been used to express the s protein of sars-cov faber et al 2005 immunogenicity studies in mice showed the induction of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies after a single dose but no protection studies have been shown similarly an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus vsv vector was used to express the s protein of sars-cov kapadia et al 2005 mice vaccinated with vsv-s developed sars-cov neutralizing antibodies that controlled challenge with sars-cov performed at 1 or 4 months after a single vaccination in summary immunization to prevent sars using different live vector systems has shown that protection is mainly mediated by humoral immune responses to the s protein a warning signal was that at least with some vectors such as vee virus the expression of n protein may lead to side effects the effect of the deletion of group-specific genes in different coronaviruses has been studied reports using mouse hepatitis virus mhv as a model have shown that deletion mutants removing orfs 4 5a 7a and he are attenuating in the natural host de haan et al 2002a similarly studies deleting orf 7 of tgev ortego et al 2003 and orfs 3abc and 7ab of fipv haijema et al 2004 led to virus attenuation however sars-cov deletion mutants lacking orfs 3a 3b 6 7a or 7b did not significantly influence in vitro and in vivo replication efficiency in the mouse model yount et al 2005 all recombinant viruses replicated to wild-type levels in the murine model suggesting that either the group-specific orfs play little role in in vivo replication efficiency or that the mouse model is not of sufficient quality for discerning the role of the group-specific orfs in disease in fact it has been surprising that orfs like 3a 7a and 7b that encode structural virus proteins huang et al 2006 schaecher and pekosz 2006 yount et al 2005 have little influence on in vivo virus replication in the mouse model only deletion of orf 3a has shown a minor decrease about one log unit in virus growth yount et al 2005 furthermore deletion of more than one gene such as deletion of orfs 3a and 3b and orf6 showed a 115 log reduction in vero cells but little effect on growth in the murine model at day 2 postinfection moreover little difference in growth or pathogenesis were noted in the mice model between wt and deletion mutants lacking orf3a and orf7 therefore the effect of sars-cov gene deletions needs to be tested in more relevant animal models interestingly the simultaneous deletion of larger combinations of group-specific genes such as 6 7a 7b 8a 8b and 9b has lead to the production of an infectious sars-cov deletion-mutant that propagates in cell culture with a titer similar to that of the parental wild type virus the potential of this deletion-mutant as a promising vaccine candidate is being studied ml dediego and l enjuanes unpublished results a recombinant sars-cov rsars-cov that lacks the e gene generated from a bacterial artificial chromososme bac was attenuated in vitro and in an animal model dediego et al 2007 the e gene was previously shown to be a non-essential gene for the group 2 mhv coronavirus kuo and masters 2003 although elimination of this gene from mhv genome reduced virus growth in cell culture more than one thousand-fold in contrast for group 1 tgev coronavirus expression of the e gene product was essential for virus release and spread propagation of e gene deleted tgev tgev-e was restored by providing e protein in trans curtis et al 2002 ortego et al 2002 the role of e protein in sars-cov propagation was studied by constructing sars-cov with a deleted e gene dediego et al 2007 interestingly viable viruses were recovered in vero e6 cells with a relatively high titer around 106
 pfuml and also from huh-7 and caco-2 cells with reduced titers fig 4
 indicating that sars-cov e protein is not essential for virus replication in cell culture electron microscopy observation of vero e6 cells infected with the sars-cov wt or the e deletion mutant showed much higher assembly efficiency for the wt virus fig 5
 in this respect sars-cov-e behaves as mhv the other group 2 coronavirus studied although sars-cov-e grows to a considerably higher titer the differential behavior of e mutant viruses from different coronavirus groups may indicate basic differences in virion assembly or life cycles among the different groups the hamster model has been used to study sars-cov-e virus pathogenicity because it demonstrates elements present in human cases of sars-cov infections including interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation dediego et al 2007 an ideal animal model that completely reproduces human clinical disease and pathological findings has not been identified nevertheless the hamster model reproducibly supports sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract to a higher titer and for a longer duration than in mice or non-human primates virus replication in this model is accompanied by histological evidence of pneumonitis and the animals develop viremia and extrapulmonary spread of virus roberts et al 2005b although overt clinical disease is absent the hamster model is a useful model for the evaluation of sars-cov infection titers of recombinant sars-cov rsars-cov achieved in the respiratory tract of hamsters fig 6
 were similar to those previously reported roberts et al 2005b and were 1001000-fold higher than titers of the rsars-cov-e virus suggesting that this mutant virus is attenuated histopathology examination of lungs from infected hamsters was performed at two and five days post-infection because it has been shown that pulmonary disease was most notable at these time points detection of viral antigen was reduced in lungs from rsars-cov-e infected hamsters and pulmonary inflammation was less prominent in these animals than in rsars-cov-infected animals indicating that rsars-cov-e is attenuated in vivo dediego et al 2007 in fact reduction of sars-cov titers in patients has been associated with a considerable reduction in pathogenicity and survival rates chu et al 2004 hung et al 2004 in contrast challenge of hamsters with recombinant viruses lacking single group specific orfs3a and orf7 did not result in significant reductions in virus titier or pathology baric et al unpublished therefore sars-cov-e attenuated virus is a promising vaccine candidate that is being evaluated in different animal models mice ferrets and macaques live attenuated virus vaccines face a series of potential concerns including reversion to wt and recombination repair with circulating heterogeneous human coronaviruses or zoonotic sars strains consequently live virus vaccine formulations should include rational approaches for minimizing the potential for reversion to wt phenotype and simultaneously resist recombination repair it is clear that modifications of sars-cov genome could lead to viruses with an attenuated phenotype that could be considered safe and effective vaccine candidates the replicase as a target for attenuating coronaviruses is undiscovered territory likely ripe with alleles that might influence replication efficiency and virulence the sars-cov replicase represents a major target of future research endeavors coronaviruses have a characteristic strictly conserved genome organization with structural genes occurring in the order 5-polymerase pol-s-e-m-n-3 mhv virus mutants with the genes encoding the structural proteins located in different order were constructed de haan et al 2002b these recombinant viruses were tested for the ability to replicate in the natural host the mouse the results indicate that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for in vivo replication some of the mutants showed an attenuated phenotype similarly to what has been observed for the vsv ball et al 1999 therefore deliberate rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of attenuated coronaviruses which due to their reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses would make safer vaccines vaccines based on modifications of the replicase gene could in principle be generated by mutagenesis as modifications introduced in the mhv nsp-1coding regions have identified residues important for protein processing and viral rna replication that may affect virus virulence and could be introduced in vaccine candidates brockway and denison 2005 sars nsp1 blocks host macromolecular synthesis and abrogates ifn signaling kamitani et al 2006 providing further evidence that nsp1 coding regions represent potential virulence determinants alternatively tyr6398his substitution in open reading frame orf 1b-nsp14 has been demonstrated that attenuate mhv replication in mice sperry et al 2005 similarly deletion of the nsp2 gene in mhv and sars-cov has been shown to yield viable attenuated mutant viruses that replicate about one log less efficiently than wt virus in cell culture and in animals and may also provide a foundation for the design of live vaccines graham et al 2005 as the nsp14 tyr residue and nsp 2 are completely conserved it may be possible to engineer common coronaviridae attenuating alleles via recombinant dna techniques alternatively changes in gene order within the replicase or even relocation to the 3-end of the genome if tolerated may led to attenuated virus phenotypes other options to include safeguards into the genetically engineered vaccines particularly those that can prevent the recovery of the original virulent phenotype by recombination between the vaccine strain and viruses circulating in the field such as hcov-229e -oc43 or -nl63 have been developed one of them is the construction of replication-competent propagation-defective viruses pseudovirions that are defective in one gene conferring an attenuated phenotype or even the ability for virus propagation enjuanes et al 2005 these viruses could be grown in packaging cell lines providing in trans the missing protein in the case of sars-cov vaccine candidates without the e gene have been constructed in order to prevent the rescue of the virulent phenotype by recombination with a circulating human coronavirus the deletion of an essential gene located in a position distant from gene e and the relocation of the deleted gene to the position previously occupied by gene e has been proposed a potential recombination leading to the rescue of gene e would lead to the loss of the essential gene enjuanes 2005 an alternative approach for developing safer recombination resistant live coronavirus vaccines has been developed by modifying the transcriptional regulatory sequences trs of a vaccine strain to a sequence incompatible with the trs of any known circulating coronavirus the idea being that recombinant events between wt coronaviruses and trs remodeled sars-cov would result in genomes containing lethal mixed regulatory sequences that block expression of subgenomic mrnas fig 7a yount et al 2006 trs sequences among coronaviruses are highly conserved and direct the expression of subgenomic mrnas using a molecular clone the sars-cov trs network was remodeled from acgaac to ccggat fig 7b this rewiring of the genomic transcription network allows for efficient replication of the mutant virus icsars-crg the icsars-crg recombinant virus replicated to titers equivalent to wt virus and expressed the typical ratios of subgenomic mrnas and proteins interestingly some new transcripts were noted initiating from the replicase gene most of which could encode n-terminal truncated orf1a polyproteins it is not clear if these novel transcripts might influence pathogenic outcomes although in some instances nsp3 is truncated potentially allowing for the establishment of dominant negative phenotypes on replication in cell culture and animals an attractive sars-cov vaccine could further be modified by building attenuating mutations on the genetic template of the recombination-resistant trs rewired virus either for use as a safe high titer seed stock for making killed vaccines or as a live virus vaccine one interesting refinement of this approach would be to include secondary traps that are activated in recombinant genomes in this instance wt trs sequences can be designed into intragenic sites in essential orfs like the s and m glycoprotein genes in recombinant viruses encoding wt leader trs sequences subgenomic transcription might initiate from within the essential structural genes and the resulting n-terminal deletions would likely be lethal or severely attenuating both humoral and t-cell-mediated responses to animal coronaviruses may exacerbate disease or cause new health problems zhong et al 2005 t-cell responses have been implicated in the demyelinization of the brain and spinal cord following infection with neurotropic mhv castro and perlman 1995 wu et al 2001 a group 2 coronavirus like sars-cov adverse humoral responses to another group 2 coronavirus bovine coronavirus bcov have also been linked to the development of shipping fever in cattle oconnor et al 2001 moreover previous exposure to fipv or passive or active immunization against this virus a group 1 coronavirus was found to cause the early death syndrome instead of providing immune protection pedersen et al 1981 weiss et al 1980 this disease exacerbation was due to the virus-specific antibodies that facilitated and enhanced uptake and spread of the virus causing ade of infectivity porterfield 1986 vennema et al 1990 weiss and scott 1981 that is caused by spike protein specific antibodies corapi et al 1995 corapi et al 1992 olsen et al 1993 olsen et al 1992 with this scenario of side effects caused by some coronavirus vaccines a safety concern is that sars-cov could induce similar antibody- or cell-mediated immune pathologies this concern was increased mainly by three reports one study utilizing lentivirus pseudotyped with various sars-cov s proteins yang et al 2005 indicated that within the s protein the major target for vaccine and immunotherapy there are minor differences among eight strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003 whereas substantial functional changes were detected in s derived from a case in late 2003 from guandong province isolate gd03 and from two palm civets sz16 and sz3 the gd03 spike pseudotyped virus is markedly resistant to antibody neutralization alternatively antibodies that neutralized most human s glycoproteins enhanced virus entry mediated by two civet cat virus s glycoproteins related to the gd03 isolate yang et al 2005 in another report it has been shown that the administration into ferrets of mva-based sars-cov s vaccine but not mva alone followed by live sars-cov challenge resulted in enhanced hepatitis weingartl et al 2004 these side effects have not been reported in other studies with sars-cov in ferrets in which it has been shown that ferrets are a useful model for sars-cov martina et al 2003 similarly these data were not reproduced by other groups he et al 2006 furthermore ade of disease has not been observed with any human sars-cov strain therefore it will be important to assess vaccines in relevant animal models as they become available antibodies directed against sars-cov were found to be protective and not to enhance viral infectivity in the mouse or hamster models bisht et al 2004 roberts et al 2005b subbarao et al 2004 yang et al 2004 using inactivated sars-cov or immunization with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the s and n proteins of sars-cov see et al 2006 although their effect in humans remains unknown zhong et al 2005 side effects have not been observed in other animal models such as african green monkeys that 2 months after administration of sars-cov into the respiratory tract were challenged with sars-cov and no evidence of enhanced disease upon re-challenge was shown mcauliffe et al 2004 consistent with these results cynomolgus macaques immunized with different amounts of purified virus in the absence or the presence of adjuvant challenged by the nasal route 30 days post-immunization showed no side effects even in the presence of low titer neutralizing antibodies temperature breathing appetite mental state and all biochemical indexes were normal for immunized monkeys and no abnormalities were observed in major organs such as lung liver kidney etc all control non-vaccinated animals showed interstitial pneumonia these results indicate that the purified sars-cov vaccine is safe in monkeys qin et al 2006 in summary immunization of mice using either s protein or whole inactivated virus spruth et al 2006 or of monkeys with whole inactivated sars-cov qin et al 2006 zhou et al 2005 most frequently resulted in the absence of side effects after providing different types of sars-cov vaccines in contrast vee virus expressing n protein failed to induce protection in either young or senescent animals and resulted in enhanced immunopathology following viral challenge between days 4 and 14 post-infection therefore caution has to be taken before including n in vaccine formulations by expressing n protein using dna immunization or vee vectors deming et al 2006 as no protection was elicited in mice against homologous challenge and no benefit to vaccination with a cocktail of both s and n proteins was observed rather the co-expression of n protein in vaccine regimens which failed to simultaneously induce a strong neutralizing anti-s antibody response led to an increased number of lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates which are also characteristic of the immune pathology observed with respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection following vaccination with formalin inactivated rsv de swart et al 2002 hancock et al 1996 therefore the concern has been raised that expression of n protein may result in vaccine-enhanced pulmonary disease as previously described for viruses like rsv kim et al 1969 the data suggest that the presence of n protein in vaccines should be evaluated in each vaccine formulation deming et al 2006 although thus far no human sars-cov s vaccine has been shown to be involved in ade of disease possible immunopathological complications of sars vaccine candidates require rigorous clinical and immunological evaluation whereas the production of effective and safe vaccines for animal coronavirus previously reported has not been satisfactory cavanagh 2003 enjuanes et al 1995 saif 2004 the production of inactivated subunit or vaccines based on dna recombinant vectors or by reverse genetics using sars-cov genomes seem more

gerd sutter asisa volz   the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov a hitherto unknown -coronavirus emerged as a causative agent of a severe respiratory disease in humans in 2012 this new coronavirus was first isolated from the sputum of a patient suffering from severe pneumonia and renal failure 1 to date the mers-cov still causes disease and death in humans with a total of 2260 confirmed cases including 803 fatalities 23 epidemiological data suggest that the mers-cov is endemic in saudi arabia which accounts for the majority of primary community-acquired cases many of those primary cases are due to virus exposure through direct contact with dromedary camels the primary animal reservoir of mers-cov alternatively camel workers undergoing subclinical infections are suggested to mediate virus transmission to other susceptible individuals 45 other outbreaks of mers have been caused by nosocomial transmissions in health care settings 6789 most of the mers-cov infections occur within the arabian peninsula ie saudi arabia qatar and united arab emirates however mers cases have been reported in various other countries around the world 910 at present there is still relatively little known about the pathogenesis of mers-cov the highest incidence of severe disease is observed in elderly and immunocompromised individuals 11 those at general risk for infections are health care workers and people in close contact with dromedary camels 1213 these groups are therefore considered relevant target populations for prophylactic vaccination against mers-cov infection and prevention of mers the world health organization who and the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi have listed mers as priority target for vaccine development 14 however so far no candidate vaccines have proceeded beyond phase iiia clinical testing 15 one of these candidate vaccines is based on modified vaccinia virus ankara mva a safety-tested and replication-deficient vaccinia virus serving as an advanced viral vector platform for the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer for review see 16 in that context we still know relatively little about the correlates of vaccine induced protection against mers-cov it is well-known that virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against the spike glycoprotein s protein correlate with protective immunity against coronavirus infections in general 17181920 since the s protein is present on the cell surface s protein is considered as the major antigen to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and as a key immunogen for the development of mers-cov candidate vaccines 2122232425 however based on current knowledge from the biology of -coronaviruses we hypothesize that also other viral proteins warrant consideration as immunogens and targets of virus-specific antibodies and t cells among those the nucleocapsid protein n protein is produced at high levels in infected cells and has been proposed as useful candidate protein for clinical diagnosis 2627282930 the coronavirus n proteins have been associated with multiple functions in the virus life cycle including the regulation of viral rna synthesis the packaging of the viral rna in helical nucleocapsids and in virion assembly through interaction with the viral m protein 31323334 furthermore several reports suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov n protein functions as an immune evasion protein and an antagonist of the host interferon response 353637 recently the overexpression of mers-cov n in human a549 cells was found to be linked to an up-regulation of antiviral host gene expression including the synthesis of the inflammatory chemokine cxcl10 38 despite this possible immune modulatory activity sars-cov n-specific immune responses are reported to be long-lived and more broadly reactive when compared to sars-cov s-specific immunity 39 likewise we were curious as to the suitability of the mers-cov n protein to serve as a vaccine antigen the n protein is not present on the surface of mers-cov particles nor is it predicted to be expressed on the surface membrane of mva infected cells from this we hypothesized that the most relevant part of mers-cov n-specific immunity is based on cd8 t cell responses relying on the processing and presentation of intracellular antigens currently there is little information about mers-cov n-specific immune responses including the in vivo induction of n-specific cellular immunity in this study we investigated the synthesis and delivery of the mers-cov n protein as a privileged antigen by a mva vector virus the recombinant mva expressing a synthetic gene sequence of full-length mers-cov n mva-mers-n proved genetically stable and fully replication-competent in chicken embryo fibroblasts an established cell substrate for mva vaccine manufacturing upon in vitro infection mva-mers-n produced high amounts of the heterologous protein that were detectable with mers-cov n-specific antibodies furthermore mva-mers-n was tested as an experimental vaccine in balbc mice and elicited mers-cov n-specific interferon  ifn--producing cd8 t cells using peptide library covering the whole mers-cov n polypeptide we identified new h2-d restricted peptide epitopes of mers-cov n in balbc mice this data will be highly relevant for further assessment of n antigen-specific immune responses in the well-established mers-cov-balbc mouse immunizationchallenge model 4041424344 female balbc mice 6 to 10-week-old were

roche diagnostics penzberg germany as recommended by the manufacturer at 48 h after infection the cell cultures were harvested and recombinant mva expressing the mers-cov n protein was clonally

miltenyi biotec bergisch gladbach germany statistical analysis was performed by t-test using graphpad prism version 5 software graphpad software san diego ca usa p-values less than 005 were considered to be statistically significant recombinant virus mva-mers-n was formed in cef that were infected with mva and transfected with the mva vector plasmid piiih5red-mers-n figure 1a the mva dna sequences in piiih5red-mers-n flank-1 flank-2 targeted the insertion of the n gene sequences into the site of deletion iii within the mva genome the clonal isolation was facilitated by co-production of the red fluorescent reporter protein mcherry allowing for the convenient detection of mva-mers-n infected cells during plaque purification the repetitive dna sequence of flank-1 fr served to remove the marker gene mcherry from the genome of the final recombinant virus through initiating an intragenomic homologous recombination marker gene deletion after pcr analysis confirmed the presence of more than 95 mva-mers-n recombinant viruses in the cultures we selected the final marker-free recombinant viruses by plaque purification and screening for plaques without mcherry fluorescence to confirm genetic integrity and proper insertion of the heterologous n gene sequences within the mva-mers-n genome we analyzed viral genomic dna by pcr using specific oligonucleotide primers specific for mva sequences adjacent to the deletion iii insertion site figure 1b additional pcrs specific for mva sequences within the c7l gene locus or adjacent to the major deletion sites i ii iv v and vi served to control for the genetic identity and genomic stability of mva-mers-n figure 1c and data not shown next we evaluated the recombinant virus mva-mers-n by multi-step growth analysis in different cell lines figure 1d in cef the cell culture routinely used to propagate recombinant mva vaccines mva-mers-n efficiently replicated to titers similar to those obtained with non-recombinant mva in contrast the human cell lines hacat and hela proved non-permissive for productive virus growth confirming the well-preserved replication deficiency of the recombinant mva-mers-n in cells of mammalian origin to confirm the synthesis of mers-cov n protein upon mva-mers-n infection total cell proteins from infected cef and hacat cells were separated by sds-page and analyzed by immunoblotting figure 2 consistent with the expected molecular mass of the mers-cov n protein we readily detected a 45 kda polypeptide using the n-specific mouse monoclonal antibody at 24 hours post infection hpi a prominent band of n protein was visible in the lysates from both cell lines suggesting efficient synthesis of the recombinant protein under permissive and non-permissive growth conditions for mva-mers-n figure 2a in addition the comparative western blot analysis of cell lysates from mva-mers-n or mva-mers-s infected cef with antigen-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies suggested the production of comparable amounts of both mers-cov candidate antigens figure 2b this observation is in line with the fact that the mva-mers-s candidate vector vaccine expresses the mers-cov s gene sequences using the identical pmh5 promoter system 23 as shown in previous studies we detected two mers-cov s-specific protein bands upon infection with mva-mers-s indicating the authentic proteolytic cleavage of the full-length s glycoprotein 210 kda into an n-terminal 120 kda s1 domain and a c-terminal 85 kda s2 domain not detected subunit 235051 following this we used the total protein lysates from mva-mers-n or mva-mers-s infected cef to assess the recognition of the mers-cov n and s antigens by sera from experimentally mers-cov infected animals the western blot analysis of sera from an infected rabbit figure 2c or a cynomolgus monkey figure 2d revealed the presence of antibodies specific for the mers-cov n protein the recognition of the mers-cov n protein was at least as prominent as the mers-cov s antigen which was suggestive of the induction of substantial n-specific antibody responses after experimental mers-cov infections t cell responses against coronaviruses are known to be long lived and mostly target the more conserved cov internal structural n protein however information on mers-cov n antigen-specific t cell specificities is still limited thus we aimed first to identify n polypeptide-specific t cell epitopes in balbc mice immunized twice with recombinant virus mva-mers-n or non-recombinant mva as a control via the intraperitoneal and intramuscular routes eight days after the final immunization splenocytes were prepared and the purified cd4 and cd8 t cells were restimulated in vitro with overlapping peptides corresponding to the n protein overlapping peptides were pooled using a two-dimensional pooled-peptide matrix system table s1 and screened by ifn- elispot the stimulation of splenoctyes from mva-mers-n immunized mice with the peptides from 16 out of the total 18 peptide pools did not result in the detection of ifn- producing t cells above background numbers obtained with splenocytes from mock or mva-control vaccinated animals stimulation with the peptides from pools h8 n  10 and v8 n  10 as well as the use of the vaccinia virus positive peptide f2l 49 data not shown showed elevated numbers of ifn- spot forming cells sfc in cd8 t cell cultures figure 3ab mva-mers-n immunizations given by ip and im routes resulted in comparable t cell stimulatory capacities of overlapping n-specific peptides from pools v8 and h8 in contrast peptides from other pools showed no or only minor stimulatory activities as exemplified for peptides in pools v4 and v6  following this the peptides within the v8 and h8 peptide pools were used to elucidate in more detail the t cell epitope specificities we subdivided the peptides from h8 and v8 in four new pools each containing five peptides h81 h82 v81 v82 in addition we separately tested the two 15-mer peptides 89 and 90 which were shared between pools h8 and v8 we again vaccinated balbc mice with mva-mers-n using ip or im inoculations in a prime-boost regime splenocytes were prepared at day eight after the last vaccination and purified cd8 t cells were restimulated with subpools v81 v82 h81 and h82 figure 4a stimulation with peptides from pools v81 or h81 activated only minor levels of ifn- producing cells with mean levels about 23 sfc106 splenocytes yet the stimulation with subpools v82 and h82 revealed clearly higher numbers of activated t cells with 83-176 ifn- sfc106 splenocytes comparable numbers of ifn- producing cells were again induced by ip or im immunization of note the stimulations with the 15-mer peptides 89 n353-367  qnidayktfpkkekk or 90 n357-371  ayktfpkkekkqkap alone resulted in detection of substantial quantities of ifn- producing cells mean levels about 71107 sfc106 splenocytes in mice that had been vaccinated with mva-mers-n by both immunization routes figure 4b cd8 t cells purified from mice receiving non-recombinant mva or mock vaccine pbs did not produce ifn- following stimulation with peptides from subpools v81-h82 and with peptides 89 and 90 when checking for the specific peptides contained within the subpools we observed that the strongly stimulatory peptides 89 and 90 were part of the subpools v82 and h82 whereas these peptides were absent in v81 and h81 this data suggested that the overlapping 15-mer peptides 89 and 90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of mers-cov n-specific cd8 t cell responses to map more precisely this specific epitope within the mers-cov n protein we concentrated on the overlapping 11-mer peptide shared between peptides 89 and 90 and obtained nine 8-10-mer peptides table 1 using these peptides for the stimulation of splenoctyes from mva-mers-n vaccinated mice we obtained the highest numbers of ifn- producing t cells with peptide 102 mean levels of 94 to 97 sfc106 splenocytes while the other peptides 101 91 92 93 81 82 83 84 induced weaker responses with a mean of 576 ifn- sfc106 splenocytes figure 5ab furthermore we tested the 102 peptide to monitor n-specific t cell responses by ifn- ics and fluorescence activated cell sorting facs analysis indeed we could detect significant numbers of 102 peptide-specific cd8 t cells being induced and activated by the mva-mers-n prime-boost vaccination in comparison the cd4 t cell populations from splenocytes of immunized animals demonstrated only background levels of ifn- producing cells figure 5c the vaccinia virus-specific immunodominant cd8 t cell determinant f2l 49 served as control peptide for the detection of mva-specific cd8 t cells figure 5d the availability of appropriate mers-cov-specific immune monitoring tools is a prerequisite for the successful development of vaccines and therapeutic approaches the development of these tools is hampered by the fact that we still know little about the relevant viral antigens and the overall pathogenesis of the mers-cov infection recent studies describe a number of cases with asymptomatic mers-cov infection in humans and raise questions as to which factors influence the clinical manifestation of mers 5253 since asymptomatic or mild clinical manifestations of mers-cov infection are often associated with low levels of seropositivity the analysis of mers-cov-specific cellular immune responses may facilitate further insight into the immune correlates of disease prevention moreover in order to characterize the pathogenesis of mers-cov infection it will be indispensable to monitor the role of virus-specific t cells in animal models of mers and to precisely identify the antigen specificities of these t cell responses in the present study we identified a major histocompatibility complex mhc haplotype h2-d restricted peptide epitope in the mers-cov n protein by stimulating t cells from mva-mers-n vaccinated balbc mice with a 2-d matrix pool of overlapping peptides these mice have already been used in various preclinical studies to establish the mers-cov s protein as an important vaccine antigen for induction of virus neutralizing antibodies 2340414254 moreover balbc mice transduced with the human cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hdpp4 using an adenovirus vector are susceptible to productive mers-cov lung infection which allows for the testing of the protective efficacy of mers-cov-specific immunization using the mers-cov s protein 2440414344 here we wished to specifically assess the suitability of an mva-delivered mers-cov n antigen for the activation of cellular immune responses in mice in general the n protein is a well conserved internal protein and the major structural component incorporating the viral rna within the viral nucleocapsid 55 in previous studies the sars-cov n protein has also been used as candidate antigen for vaccine development 56 and an experimental dna vaccine efficiently induced sars-cov n-specific cellular immunity 5758 in line with this data recent studies in mers patients demonstrated that both antibody and t cell responses are associated with recovery from mers-cov infection 59 the recombinant virus mva-mers-n produced stable amounts of mers-cov n antigen upon in vitro infection of human cells indicating the unimpaired expression of the target gene at the level of viral late transcription using the synthetic vaccinia virus-specific promoter pmh5 46 moreover the mers-cov n antigen produced in mva-mers-n infected cells was strongly recognized by antibodies from experimentally infected laboratory animals suggesting that n-specific immune responses were potently activated upon mers-cov infection it seems noteworthy that mers-cov productively replicates in rabbits but viral loads are low and the animals develop no overt disease symptoms however haagmans et al found infectious virus in the lung tissues of the rabbits and revealed the presence of the mers-cov n antigen in bronchiolar epithelial cells and in the epithelial cells of the nose 60 the localization of n in these respiratory epithelial cells may result in an efficient recognition by innate and also adaptive immune cells similar to those described for other viruses inducing robust protective immunity 61 this might be a possible explanation for efficient activation of mers-cov n-specific antibodies despite a barely productive mers-cov infection similar outcomes of infection were observed upon mers-cov infection in cynomolgus macaques and other relevant non-human primate models 6263 thus the induction of n-specific immune responses in these animals emphasizes the potential usefulness of the mers-cov n protein to serve as vaccine antigen nevertheless the immunogenicity of n requires further characterization in preclinical models for mers-cov infection in addition to the induction of mers-cov-specific antibodies the mers-cov n protein holds promise to efficiently activate virus-specific cd8 t cell responses for more detailed studies characterizing the possible role of these t cell specificities in mers-cov-associated immunity or pathogenesis it is highly relevant to determine the n peptide epitopes allowing for the appropriate mhc-restricted antigen presentation and the activation of virus-specific t cells in this study we identified a new h2-d restricted cd8 t cell epitope in the mers-cov n protein using a 2-d matrix and pools of 84 overlapping 15-mer n peptides first we have identified two mers-cov n derived peptides n353-367  qnidayktfpkkekk and n357-371  ayktfpkkekkqkap and further mapped these 15-mer peptides to the minimal aa sequence of n358-367  yktfpkkekk representing a decamer peptide epitope figure s1 64 analysis of mers-cov sequences reveals that n358-367 is conserved among different strains of mers-cov table s2 65 the availability of such an epitope may allow for more detailed experimental monitoring of cellular immune responses induced by a mva based candidate vaccine against mers-cov in the mouse model and potentially also in other preclinical models of note the h2-d restricted cd8 t cell epitope enables characterization of t cell responses in balbc mice that serve as a well-established mers-cov infection model following adenovirus vector mediated transduction with hdpp4 2440414344 a particular feature of mers in humans as observed upon the investigation of cluster outbreaks in hospitals is the lack of detectable mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in patients with confirmed disease 6667 this observation is attributed to the emergence of specific virus mutants evading the neutralizing antibody response as already described for sars-cov 6869 thus future use of a t cell-specific immune monitoring might contribute to a more detailed understanding of mers pathogenesis here studies on the function of mers-cov-specific cd8 t cells in this balbc mouse mers-cov lung infection model will be helpful to better estimate the role of cellular immunity in vaccine mediated protection in mers-cov infection finally the mva-mers-n vector virus generated for this study proved to be a stable recombinant virus that can be readily amplified to obtain vaccine preparations technically fulfilling all requirements for further preclinical or even clinical development future work with mva-mers-n candidate vaccines should help to elucidate the potential protective capacity of n-specific immune responses in mers-cov infections models and contribute to our better understanding of mers vaccine-induced protection  design of a multiepitope-based peptide vaccine against the e protein of human covid-19 an immunoinformatics approach miyssa abdelmageed i abdelrahman abdelmoneim h mujahed mustafa i nafisa elfadol m naseem murshed s shaza shantier w abdelrafie makhawi m   coronaviruses cov are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov in the last decades six strains of coronaviruses were identified however in december 2019 a new strain has spread across wuhan city china 1 2 it was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who 3 in late january 2020 who declared the outbreak a global pandemic with cases in more than 45 countries where the covid-19 was spreading fast outside china most significantly in south korea italy and iran with over 2924 deaths and 85212 cases confirmed while 39537 recovered on 29 february 2020 0605 am gmt covid-19 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus ssrna its rna sequence is approximately 30000 bases in length 4 it belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus and genus betacoronavirus within the family coronaviridae the corona envelope e protein is a small integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle such as pathogenesis envelope formation assembly and budding alongside with its interactions with both other cov proteins m n and s and host cell proteins release of infectious particles after budding 59 the infected person is characterized with fever upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms diarrhea lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and increased c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels or combination of all these within 3-6 days after exposure further molecular diagnosis can be made by real-time pcr for genes encoding the internal rna-dependent rna polymerase and spikes receptor binding domain which can be confirmed by sanger sequencing and full genome analysis by ngs multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays 1014 a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses is possible to reconstruct with a sufficient number of sequenced genomes the phylogenetic analysis indicates that covid-19 likely originated from bats 15 it also showed that it is highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor 16 the sequence of covid-19 rbd together with its rbm that contacts receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was found similar to that of sars coronavirus in january 2020 a group of scientists demonstrated that ace2 could act as the receptor for covid-19 1721 however covid-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at the 2019-ncov receptor-binding motif particularly gln493 which provide advantageous interactions with human ace2 15 this difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than other viruses at present there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans but chinese traditional medicines such as shufengjiedu capsules and lianhuaqingwen capsules could be possible treatments for covid-19 however there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy for these drugs 22 the main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself although traditional vaccines which depend on biochemical trials induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized animals they can be costly allergenic and time-consuming and require in vitro culture of pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety 23 24 thus the need for safe and efficacious vaccines is highly recommended peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses 25 26 the core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized b-cell and t-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses a b-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked with a t-cell epitope to make it immunogenic the t-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments 8-20 amino acids whereas the b-cell epitopes can be proteins 27 28 therefore in this study we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict epitopes from the corona envelope e protein using immunoinformatics analysis 2934 rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection full genbank files of the complete genomes

httpwwwddg-pharmfacnetvaxijenvaxijenvaxijenhtml it is a software package proposed to stream a distinct program that can run nearly any sequence operation as well as a few basic alignment investigations the sequences of the e protein retrieved from uniprot were run in bioedit to determine the conserved sites through clustalw in the application settings 37 mega version 1016 is software for the comparative analysis of molecular sequences it is used for pairwise and multiple sequence alignment alongside construction and analysis of phylogenetic trees and evolutionary relationships the gap penalty was 15 for opening and 666 for extending the gap for both pairwise and multiple sequence alignment bootstrapping of 300 was used in construction of the maximum like hood phylogenetic tree 38 39 httpswwwmegasoftwarenet iedb tools were used to predict the conserved sequences 10-mer sequence from hla class i and class ii t-cell epitopes by using an artificial neural network ann approach 4042 the artificial neural network ann version 22 was chosen as the prediction method as it depends on the median inhibitory concentration ic50 40 4345 for the binding analysis all the alleles were carefully chosen and the length was set at 10 before prediction was done analysis of epitopes binding to the mhc class i and ii molecules was assessed by the iedb mhc prediction server at httptoolsiedborgmhci and httptoolsiedborgmhcii respectively all conserved immunodominant peptides binding to the mhc i and ii molecules at scores equal or less than 100 median inhibitory concentrations ic50 and 1000 respectively were selected for further analysis while epitopes with ic50 greater than 100 were eliminated 46 population coverage for each epitope was carefully determined by the iedb population coverage calculation tool due to the diverse binding sites of epitopes with different hla alleles the most promising epitope candidates were calculated for population coverage against the population of the whole world china and europe to get and ensure a universal vaccine 47 48 httptoolsiedborgpopulation the reference sequence of the e protein that has been retrieved from genbank was used as an input in raptorx to predict the 3d structure of the e protein 49 50 the visualization of the obtained 3d protein structure was performed in ucsf chimera version18 51 in order to estimate the binding affinities between the epitopes and the molecular structure of mhc i and mhc ii in silico molecular docking was used sequences of proposed epitopes were selected from the covid-19 reference sequence using ucsf chimera 110 and saved as a pdb file the obtained files were then optimized and energy minimized the hla-a0201 was selected as the macromolecule for docking its crystal structure 4uq3 was downloaded from the rcsb protein data bank httpwwwrcsborgpdbhomehomedo which was in a complex with an azobenzene-containing peptide 52 all water molecules and heteroatoms in the retrieved target file 4uq3 were then removed the target structure was further optimized and energy minimized using swiss pdb viewer v410 software 53 molecular docking was performed using autodock 40 software based on the lamarckian genetic algorithm which combines energy evaluation through grids of affinity potential to find the suitable binding position for a ligand on a given protein 54 55 polar hydrogen atoms were added to the protein targets and kollman united atomic charges were computed the targets grid map was calculated and set to 60  60  60 points with grid spacing of 0375  the

results were retrieved as binding energies and poses that showed the lowest binding energies visualized using ucsf chimera the reference sequence of the envelope protein was aligned with the hcov-hku1 reference protein using the artemis comparison tool as illustrated in figure 2 the mutated proteins were tested for antigenicity using vaxijen software where the envelope protein was found as the best immunogenic target in table 1 sequence alignment of the covid-19 envelope protein was done using bioedit software which shows total conservation across four sequences which were retrieved from china and the usa figure 3 to study the evolutionary relationship between all the seven strains of coronavirus a multiple sequence alignment msa was performed using clustalw by mega software this alignment was used to construct the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree as seen in figure 4 the iedb website was used to analyze the 2019-ncov envelope protein for t-cell-related peptides results show ten mhc class i- and ii-associated peptides with high population coverage tables 2 and 3 figure 5 the most promising peptides were visualized using ucsf chimera software figures 6a and 6b designing a novel vaccine is very crucial to defend against the rapid endless global burden of diseases 5659 in the last few decades biotechnology has advanced rapidly alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccine design 60 peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen-specific b- and t-cells 25 applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands 6163 this approach has been used frequently in saint louis encephalitis virus 64 dengue virus 65 and chikungunya virus 66 proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines the covid-19 is an rna virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the dna viruses 67 these mutations lie on the surface of the protein which makes covid-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in a blind spot 68 in our present work different peptides were proposed for designing a vaccine against covid-19 figure 1 in the beginning the whole genome of covid-19 was analyzed by a comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target 69 the artemis comparison tool act was used to analyze human coronavirus hcov-hku1 reference sequence vs wuhan-hu-1 covid-19 results obtained figure 2 revealed extensive mutations among the tested genomes new genes orf8 and orf6 were found inserted in covid-19 which were absent in hcov-hku1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission 70 the high rate of mutation between the two genomes was observed in the region from 20000 bp to the end of the sequence this region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are the envelope e protein nucleocapsid n protein membrane m protein and spike s protein all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus 71 72 these conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment between mers-cov and bat coronavirus 73 and analyzed in sars-cov 74 the four proteins were then analyzed by vaxijen software to test the probability of antigenic proteins protein e was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as shown in table 1 a literature survey confirmed this result in which protein e was investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and more recently middle-east respiratory syndrome mers 71 furthermore the conservation of this protein against the seven strains was tested and confirmed through the use of the bioedit package tool figure 3 phylogenetic analysis is a very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship between strains multiple sequence alignment msa was performed using clustalw for the seven strains of coronavirus which are covid-19 nc04551 sars-cov fj211859 mesa-cov nc019843 hcov-hku1 ay884001 hcov-oc43 kf923903 hcov-nl63 nc005831 and hcov-229e ky983587 the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree revealed that covid-19 is found in the same clade of sars-cov thus the two strains are highly related to each other figure 4 the immune response of t-cells is considered a long-lasting response compared to b-cells where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response 75 vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated responses are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen moreover the cd8 and cd4 t-cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity 76 thus designing a vaccine against t-cells is much more important choosing protein e as the antigenic site the binding affinity to mhc molecules was then evaluated the protein reference sequence was submitted to the iedb mhc predication tool 21 peptides were found to bind mhc class i with different affinities table 1 from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage table 2 figure 5 analysis in the iedb mhc ii binding prediction tool resulted in prediction of 61 peptides table 2 from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage table 3 figure 5 unfortunately iedb did not give any result for b-cell epitopes this might be due to the length of the covid-19 75 amino acids it is well known that peptides recognized with a high number of hla molecules are potentially inducing immune response based on the aforementioned results and taking into consideration the high binding affinity to both mhc class i and ii conservancy and population coverage three peptides are strongly proposed to formulate a new vaccine against covid-19 these findings were further confirmed by the results obtained for the molecular docking of the proposed peptides and hla-a0201 the formed complex between the mhc molecule and the three peptides yvysrvknl slvkpsfyv and lailtalrl has shown peptide amino- and carboxyl-termini forming one and three hydrogen bonds respectively at the two ends of a binding groove with mhc residues with the least binding energy -132 kcalmol -11 kcalmol and -113 kcalmol respectively figures 6c6e although both flu and anti-hiv drugs are used currently in china for treatment of covid-19 chloroquine phosphate an old drug for treatment of malaria has recently been found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against covid-19 77 78 nevertheless more studies are required to standardize these therapies in addition there has been some success in the development of mouse models of mers-cov and sars-cov infection and candidate vaccines where the envelope e protein is mutated or deleted have been described 7985 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to identify certain peptides in the envelope e protein as candidates for covid-19 accordingly these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitope vaccine candidates against t-cells extensive mutations insertion and deletion were discovered in the covid-19 strain using the comparative sequencing in addition a number of the mhc class i- and ii-related peptides were found to be promising candidates among which the peptides yvysrvknl slvkpsfyv and lailtalrl show high potentiality for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage the t-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for covid-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target nevertheless the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically ensuring its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks  recombinant feline coronaviruses as vaccine candidates confer protection in spf but not in conventional

only partial protection pedersen and black 1983 pedersen et al 1984 pedersen and floyd 1985 frequently leading to antibody enhancement of the disease ade and the so-called early death syndrome currently a temperature-sensitive strain of fipv is marketed worldwide with an ability to protect cats against fipv gerber et al 1990 gerber 1995 but its efficacy is uncertain mcardle et al 1995 scott et al 1995 fehr et al 1997 the most promising results were obtained with recombinant fipv mutants lacking the orf3abc or orf7ab regions that provided 100 and 80 protection after a lethal homologous challenge haijema et al 2004 respectively however no follow-up studies using these vaccine candidates have been published so far in the present study we provide data of immunisation experiments with a recombinant fcov pair differing only in the truncation pbfipv-df-2 and intactness pbfipv-df-2-r3i of their orf3abc regions blint et al 2012 in previous in vivo studies using specific pathogen free spf cats pbfipv-df-2 proved to be low virulent shed only at limited titres in faeces and was completely cleared by the immune system but elicited medium level immune response while pbfipv-df-2-r3i showed active intestinal replication and faecal shedding and it possessed completely avirulent phenotype blint et al 2013 considering these advantageous characteristics of the two recombinant fcovs we evaluated their innocuity and efficacy as vaccine candidates in conferring protection in spf as well as in conventional purebred british shorthair cats

 tcid50ml the viruses were then added to fcwf-4 cells showing 70 confluency in a 96-well plate and incubated for 48 h until the development of cytopathic effect neutralising activity was determined by end-point dilution shiba et al 2007 to study whether pbfipv-df-2 and pbfipv-df-2-r3i inoculation would protect cats against a homologous fipv challenge vaccination and challenge experiments were performed group 1 and group 2 cats were vaccinated oronasally twice with pfipv-df-2 and pbfipv-df-2-r3i 103 tcid50 at d0 and d14 respectively the in vivo characteristics of the recombinant viruses were similar to those of earlier experiments blint et al 2013 cats in group 1 showed only early mild clinical signs including transient fever from d3 to d8 anorexia and slight lymphopenia table 1
 while cats in group 2 showed neither any clinical signs typical of fip nor diarrhoea table 1 no oropharyngeal shedding of either pbfipv-df-2 or pbfipv-df-2-r3i was detected during the whole period of the immunisation experiments data not shown shedding of pbfipv-df-2 in faeces of group 1 was detected in four animals from d3 to d42 with very variable amounts close to the detection limit of the genomic quantitative rt-pcr 45  1004  101 fcov rna copies per l faecal extract fig 1
 group 2 cats began to shed pbfipv-df-2-r3i from d3 virus shedding peaked at d7 with 78  105 fcov rna copies per l faecal extract remained high until d14 then began to decrease until reaching 32  102 fcov rna copies per l faecal extract at d49 and remained at this level until the end of the experiment fig 1 no neutralising activity was detected at d0 in any cat sera in contrast by d28 all the group 1 cats had seroconverted and showed medium titres 11601640 of neutralising antibodies fig 2
 group 2 cats showed variable results only three animals seroconverted by d28 and their vn titres remained at low levels 1801160 compared with those of the group 1 cats fig 2 since level of the humoral immune response after oronasal vaccination with the recombinant viruses was relatively low two intramuscular vaccinations 103 tcid50 at d28 and d42 were applied a control group c-group was mock vaccinated with pbs similarly to the oronasal vaccinations the intramuscularly inoculated kittens did not develop any signs fip table 1 no faecal virus shedding of pbfipv-df-2 of group 1 cats was detected while faecal shedding of pbfipv-df-2-r3i from group 2 kittens continued at low level fig 1 oropharyngeal shedding was not observed from any animal of the two vaccinated groups data not shown neutralising antibody titres raised in all group 1 animals after intramuscular vaccinations from 11601640 to 164012560 p

  051 fig 2 at d56 all kittens were challenged oronasally with 103 tcid50 of the virulent fipv df-2 strain and were monitored for 6 months the c-group cats showed severe clinical signs of fip starting on the second week table 2
 the two kittens died at days 22 and 24 post-challenge pc the pathological and histopathological examinations revealed lesions characteristic of systemic non-effusive fip on the contrary vaccination with both pbfipv-df-2 and pbfipv-df-2-r3i proved to be highly efficacious against lethal fipv challenge group 1 and group 2 cats remained healthy table 2 and survived for at least 6 months the vn titres did not boost significantly after the challenge fig 2 pathological examinations confirmed that none of the vaccinated cats showed any lesion characteristic of fip to study the efficacy of the vaccine candidates in field conditions the above experiment with the same protocols was repeated using conventional cats neither of the vaccinated kittens showed any signs of fatal fip table 3
 the group 1 inoculated animals showed slightly stronger clinical signs than their spf counterparts including lymphopenia which is a characteristic sign of early fipv infection while only anorexia was observed in two of the group 2 kittens table 3 oropharyngeal virus shedding was not detected in any vaccinated cat data not shown faecal virus shedding of conventional cats was approximately 05 log10 higher more intense and of longer duration 14 days extended in pbfipv inoculated animals compared with that of the spf animals fig 1 neutralising antibodies were induced in all animals showing approximately one log2 higher titres than was observed in the spf animals fig 2 after challenge all the control cats showed clinical signs of fip followed by death at day 19 and 21 pc similarly to the spf animals with a slightly faster development of the disease and earlier death table 4
 the pathological findings were characteristic of systemic non-effusive fip vaccination with pbfipv-df-2 showed variable results against lethal fipv challenge two group 1 cats cat 1and cat 2 had slightly higher vn antibody titres fig 3
 and developed fip later from day 5070 pc and died at days 65 and 86 pc respectively post-mortem examinations revealed characteristic fip lesions similar to those observed in the fulminant course of the disease three cats of group 1 developed fip within a week table 4 followed by death between days 1620 pc the fulminant course of the disease in the majority of the vaccinated animals suggested at least partial adverse effect of vaccination instead of protection in group 2 all animals developed fip within a week table 4 followed by death between days 1419 pc the exclusive fulminant course of the disease also indicated clear adverse characteristics of this vaccine candidate in all perished animals showing fulminant fip the vn titres elevated rapidly before death fig 2 a number of scientific data indicate that fip is a consequence of a recent interspecies jump of coronavirus considering the fact that this disease has not been seen before 1950 reviewed in pedersen 2009 the immunological aspects of fip are complex and have not been fully elucidated yet fipv could negatively influence immune system intervening at several points this virus variant is a highly virulent monocytemacrophage pathogen causing systemic immune complex mediated infection vennema et al 1998 takano et al 2008 chang et al 2010 these facts may explain why the acquired natural immunity in cats is rather limited against fipv and also why no efficacious vaccine is available against fipv despite the intensive efforts of academic and commercial researchers in our study the same vaccination regime was applied on spf and conventional purebred british shorthair cats using a recombinant fcov pair differing only in the truncation pbfipv-df-2 and intactness pbfipv-df-2-r3i of their orf3abc region the in vivo evaluation of this virus pair showed that these viruses possess low virulent and avirulent phenotype respectively blint et al 2013 the low and inconsistent level of faecal shedding observed in the present experiments following vaccination with the recombinant pfipv-df-2 is similar to that which was observed after the infection of orf3abc truncated fcovs chang et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 seroconversion reached medium level after the two oronasal vaccinations and it gradually elevated after the two intramuscular injections with the absence of antibody enhancement ade leading to fip strong antibody response was induced in each group after completion of the vaccination regime however high booster effect was not observed between the four individual inoculations to reach higher antibody titres or to elicit more significant booster effect modification of the vaccination protocol and further experiments might be required vaccination with pfipv-df-2 caused low level lymphopenia that proved to be transient and was not followed by a second wave of significant lymphoid cell decrease characteristic to the course of fatal fip these together with the lack of other adverse clinical signs are advantageous for the development of a safe vaccine after the vaccinations with pbfipv-df-2-r3i no clinical signs were observed which confirmed the avirulent phenotype and the fecv characteristics of this recombinant fcov faecal virus shedding was higher and detected for a prolonged period compared with that of the pfipv-df-2 this phenomenon is in accordance with previous findings that the intact orf3abc region is indispensable for enteric replication of fcov chang et al 2010 pedersen et al 2012 blint et al 2013 high mutation frequency and recombination are common features of coronaviruses which can lead to increased virulence of the attenuated strains used for vaccination for this reason the longer persistence and shedding of pbfipv-df-2-r3i after inoculation makes it a less favourable vaccine candidate than pfipv-df-2 low and inconsistent antibody response was observed subsequently after the two oronasal vaccinations with pbfipv-df-2-r3i while the antibody level significantly increased after intramuscular inoculation to a level comparable to but clearly lower than that of the pbfip-df-2 vaccinated animals the low and inconsistent initial antibody response may be the consequence of the intact orf3abc which directs fcov replication to enterocytes and restricts it in macrophages blint et al 2012 in the case of spf cats both recombinant fcovs with truncated or complemented orf3abc protected 100 of the vaccinated animals against a homologous challenge with the highly lethal fipv df-2 strain the antibody titres in these animals did not increase significantly after the challenge showing the absence of uncontrolled fipv df-2 replication non-spf and spf cats reacted physiologically very similarly to the identical vaccination regime although some of the clinical parameters fever depression anorexia of the non-spf animals were somewhat different of those observed in spf cats virus shedding and serological response levels were also slightly higher indicating more intensive virus replication and immune reaction however the most striking difference between the two experiments was that the vaccine candidates provided far less or no protection in purebred cats against the challenge of the fipv df-2 strain in most of the cases the challenge led to ade and in all case to the development of severe symptoms of fip in non-spf animals independently of the genetic characteristics of the applied vaccine candidates ade pathomechanism is not an exclusive feature of fipv infection it resembles to the ade-based dengue haemorrhagic shock syndrome first described by peiris and porterfield 1979 the same phenomenon was also observed in the case of flaviviruses alphaviruses lentiviruses influenzaviruses enteroviruses and measles virus peiris and porterfield 1979 porterfield 1986 takeda et al 1988 tamura et al 1991 chen et al 2013 iankov et al 2013 it is suspected that ade might be more severe by early fipv challenge after vaccination however the lack of development of fatal fip and ade among spf cats and the prolonged survival of two non-spf animals after 14 days challenge suggest that other biological factors could have as strong effect on the development of fip as early challenge two pbfipv-df-2 vaccinated animals originated from different litters but have common father remained symptomless for weeks and their survival time was prolonged from the usual 34 weeks to 6586 days after fipv df-2 challenge which is rather unusual after infection the course of their disease clearly differs from ade and it resembles to that of latent or sequestered infection by fipv which can be reactivated by immunosuppressive agents such as felv pedersen 1987 in our previous pilot vaccine trials we used different dna and immune stimulating complex iscom vaccine candidates harbouring n s and off7b genesproteins in both spf n
  15 and conventional cats n
  15 applying fipv df-2 as a challenge strain all the control and vaccinated animals perished within four weeks with or without the signs of ade farsang et al unpublished result studies conducted by others are congruent with ours and indicate that virtually all cats develop fip within four weeks after fipv df-2 challenge reviewed in pedersen 2009 this is the first case when we observed long-term survival in our vaccination trials it may be the consequence either of the slightly higher neutralising antibody titre of the two animals or it can be the result of the altered specificity of their immune response the prolonged survival of 40 of the pbfipv-df-2 vaccinated cats makes pbfipv-df-2 a more promising candidate than pbfipv-df-2-r3i for further vaccine development genetic and immunological differences between the spf and non-spf purebred kittens can explain the different outcome of the vaccination experiment although more frequent occurrence of fip was reported from australia in certain breeds including british shorthair than in domestic shorthair cats norris et al 2005 yet the significant influence of the genetic background of the animals is less likely because we were not able to find any survival neither among domestic shorthair cat controls in the present experiment nor among vaccinated domestic shorthair cats from our earlier iscom or dna vaccination trials after fipv df-2 challenge vaccination trials revealed that sub-neutralising level of spike protein-specific antibodies can lead to ade by facilitating fc receptor-mediated uptake of fcov by macrophagesmonocytes contributing to the development of early death syndrome weiss and scott 1981 vennema et al 1990 corapi et al 1992 hohdatsu et al 1998 olsen et al 1992 vaccination of the british shorthair cats with pbfipv-df-2 resulted in heterologous immunological response and survival times despite the common genetic background these facts also suggest that immunity status has a more substantial role in the development of the disease course after vaccination than genetic background spf kittens are bred in isolated circumstances and they neither meet a range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic parasites bacteria fungi and viruses nor take up maternal antibodies in the colostrum against them while non-spf animals kept even under the best circumstances do encounter with such microorganisms the conventional purebred british shorthair cats developed higher vn antibody titres but these antibodies or their particular fraction might have led to the observed ade although no

of spf cats with low virulent recombinant fcovs conferred complete protection against lethal homologous challenge however partial or no protection was observed using the same vaccination protocol in non-spf cats these data highlight the diverse immune responses between spf and conventional cats and suggest a decisive role of previous infection by heterologous causative agents in the outcome of

review on promising vaccine development progress for covid-19 disease tafere mulaw belete   the s protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein that promotes the entrance of the virus into host cells s protein is a major target for design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry the s protein has two domains s1 and s2 the s1 domains contain the receptor binding domain rbd that mediates attachment to the host receptor cell whereas the s2 domain facilitates the fusion of the virus to the host cell the entry of sars-cov-2 into host cells initiated by binding of the rbd to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the main receptor for sars-cov-2 on the host cells surface and cd209l is another receptor with lower affinity 7  ace2 receptors expressed in type ii alveolar cells airway epithelial cells fibroblasts endothelial cells and in several immune cells s2 subunit has a domain that facilitates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane these domains are internal membrane fusion peptide fp a membrane proximal external region mper two 7-peptide repeats and a transmembrane domain tm the s glycoprotein has a key role in the induction of immunity during infection with sars-cov-2 by eliciting neutralizingantibodies and t-cell responses studies showed that the s protein has several immunodominant parts that do not induce neutralizing antibodies but the rbd in the s1 region is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies thus full-length s glycoprotein the s1 subunit the rbd domain ntd and fp are proposed as the promising candidate to develop an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 7 8  the m-membrane protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein that gives a definite shape to the virus structure it binds to nucleocapsid and organizes the virus assembly the m protein contains t cell epitope clusters that elicit a neutralizing antibody in sars patients the e protein has a key role in the pathogenesis assembly and release of the virus the e protein inactivation modifies the virulence of covs due to changes in morphology and tropism the n-nucelocapsid protein which is within the phospholipid bilayer has a key role in complex formation with viral genome enhances m protein interaction during assembly and increases replication of the virus the e s and m proteins form the viral envelope 8 9 10 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f cases according to who guidelines infected patients treated with supportive care like bed rest oxygen saturation adequate nutrition prevention of dehydration keeping electrolyte and acid-base balance antibiotics and isolation of patients suspected or confirmed for covid-19 12  several pre-existing and potential drug candidates including remdesivir chloroquine and others are considered the therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for covid-19 include molecules binding to the virus inhibiting enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription inhibitors targeting helicase and proteases host cell protease inhibitors host cell endocytosis inhibitors anti-sense rna and ribozyme neutralizing antibodies mabs targeting host cell receptor or interfere with s1 rbd antiviral peptide targeting s2 and natural products 13  effective sars-cov-2 vaccines are crucial for controlling the covs pandemic vaccines decrease disease severity viral shedding and person to person transmission currently no vaccine has been licensed to prevent sars-cov-2 infection 14  there are different vaccine development platforms against sars-cov-2 including live attenuated virus viral vectors inactivated virus subunit vaccines recombinant dna and protein vaccines several studies are in progress but requires months to years to develop the vaccines for sars-cov-2 currently there may be many promising targets for sars-cov-2 covid-19 candidate vaccines under development include s protein or rbd subunit vaccines and replicating or non-replicating vector vaccines expressing mainly s protein or the rbd several studies showed that viral s protein subunit vaccines displayed higher neutralizing antibody titers and protection than live-attenuated sars-cov full and dna-based s protein vaccines collectively s proteingene is the preferred target site in sars vaccine development and the same strategy can be potentially useful in developing sars-cov-2 vaccine 14 15 live attenuated vaccine lav is the most immunogenic vaccines that do not require adjuvant to gain optimal response due to its effectiveness to provoke immunity mimic to the natural infection the lav contain viable but attenuated live virus with low virulence property that does not cause disease in a person with normal immune systems they reproduce slowly and thus remain a continuous source of antigen for a long period after single immunization reducing the need for booster dose 16  several lavs are found in the market to protect various disease including mumps rubella measles and varicella vaccines lav produced by passing virus in cell cultures in animals or at suboptimal temperatures allowing less virulent strains selection or by mutagenesis or deletion of the viral genes that give virulence lav is not suitable for infants immune-compromised patients and elderly people due to the risk of  inactivated whole-virus comprises the entire disease-causing virion which is inactivated physically heat or chemically it has several antigenic parts to the host and can induce diverse immunologic responses against the pathogen inactivated whole-virus has several advantages including low production cost safe and does not involve genetic manipulation iwv is conventional vaccines with mature technology and may become the first sars-cov-2 vaccine put into clinical use 19  there are three inactivated whole-virus vaccines against sars-cov-2 reached phase 12 clinical trial these phase 12 clinical trials are done by the beijing institute of biological products chictr2000032459 sinovac nct04352608 and wuhan institute of biological products chictr2000031809 20 subunit vaccines contain pathogen-derived proteins antigens with immunogenicity that can elicit the host immune system subunit vaccine is safe and easily manufactures by recombinant dna techniques but requires adjuvant to enhance a immune response so far many research institutions initiated the sars-cov-2 subunit vaccine and use the spike glycoprotein s and its fragments such as s1 s2 rbd and nucleocapsid protein as a prime target antigens as shown in table 1 21  novavax inc developed a candidate vaccine based on s protein so far clover biopharmaceuticals constructed a sars-cov-2 s protein trimer vaccine s-trimer by using its patented trimer-tag technology 22  since the rbd of s protein directly bind with the ace2 receptor on host cells rbd immunization induces specific antibodies that may block this recognition and effectively prevent the invasion of the virus most of sars-cov-2 subunit vaccines currently under development use rbd as the antigen in a study in monkeys recombinant rbd protein was used to successfully reduce viral loads in the lungs and oropharynx and to  dna vaccines dvs have a plasmid into which a particular gene incorporated that encodes the antigens that identified from the pathogenic microorganism the bacterial plasmid carrying the desired gene delivered into the host and translated the antigenic protein that stimulates the immune system normally activated by the pathogenic microorganism dvs elicit both the cell-mediated and humoral immune genome but pre-existing immunity against human ad5 is widespread hampering its use as a vector for vaccine development 35  chimpanzee adenovirus chadox1 represents an alternative to the human ad vector due to its safety and lack of preexisting immunity in humans 36  mice immunized with the ad5 vector encoding the s protein-induced systemic neutralizing antibodies and mucosal t-cells immunity ad5 vectors encoding the s1 domain of the s protein displayed stronger neutralizing antibody responses than that encoding the full length suggesting the effect of immune focusing 37   synthetic peptide vaccines have chemically produced from fragments of antigens that elicites the immune response these vaccines are inexpensive easy for preparation and quality control but display low immunogenicity thus antigen modification and adjuvant required during formulation fragments of j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f antigen has b andor tepitope activity which affect the specificity of the immune response currently a set of b and t cell epitopes isolated from s and n proteins of sars-cov these epitopes are highly conserved in sars-cov-2 and may assist efforts to develop vaccine for covid-19 disease 39  several pharmaceutical companies like generex biotechnology developing peptide based vaccines against sars-cov-2 viruses by producing synthetic peptides that mimic crucial antigens from a virus that is chemically bonded to the 4-amino acid ii-key to ensure robust immune system activation 40   new international guidance on quality safety and efficacy of dna vaccines david beasley w   over the past two decades outbreaks of novel and re-emerging infectious diseases particularly caused by zoonotic viruses have prompted an international push to develop strategies addressing research nonclinical and clinical testing manufacturing and regulatory evaluation that can increase the rapidity of medical countermeasure development to control outbreaks and prevent resurgence of those diseases most recently the emergence of a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and its explosive disseminationresulting in a global disease pandemic termed coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 that as of late april 2020 is associated with almost 31 million confirmed infections and 220000 deaths1has prompted an unprecedented response from the scientific and public health communities to develop therapies and vaccines the publicly stated timeframes of 1218 months for availability of licensed vaccines targeted against sars-cov-2 are optimistic but would have been considered fantastic even a decade ago in response to other recent global public health emergencies such as the 20142015 ebola virus epidemic in west africa and the widespread emergence of zika virus in 20152016 several national and international health policy and funding agencies have prepared lists of priority pathogens considered to have potential to cause pandemic disease and promoted the development of platform technologies that can speed the production of new vaccines against those agents or against a previously unidentified emerging pathogen often termed disease x one such group of platform technologies that is considered by many to be a key component of rapid vaccine development are nucleic acid vaccines in which the genetic sequences for potentially immunogenic and protective antigens from the pathogen are delivered as dna or rna molecules compared with more established approaches for immunization using injection of live attenuated or inactivated pathogens or protein subunits of those pathogens nucleic acid-based approaches offer several advantages for rapid response including rapid adaptability simpler manufacturing processes enhanced physical stability and robust safety23 in addition they may benefit from simplified requirements for nonclinical safety evaluation when alternative novel sequences are inserted into a previously well characterized platform construct some questions remain regarding the immunogenicity of nucleic acid vaccines compared with other more traditional vaccine approaches but significant efforts have been made to address those through optimization of vaccination routes and timing of doses and the use of vehicles and devices that facilitate uptake of the nucleic acid by host cells resulting in improved performance of this class of vaccines in large animal models and in clinical use23 concurrent with facilitating new approaches and technologies that may speed vaccine development the whos rd blueprint for action to prevent epidemics has identified alignment of regulatory expectations for the testing and evaluation of novel vaccine candidates as a key enabler for effective outbreak responses4 in 2005 who developed guidelines for assuring the quality and nonclinical safety evaluation of dna vaccines5 and based on the subsequent progression of several dna vaccines to clinical evaluation and increasing awareness of the potential utility of dna vaccines in outbreak responses initiated a process for revision of those guidelines in february 2018 from which a draft was publicly disseminated in mid-2019 for comment6 the revised guidelines focus on biologically manufactured bacterial plasmid dna for use in humans and address aspects related to control of manufacture and characterization approaches to nonclinical and clinical testing and information that may be required by national regulatory authorities for approval of clinical trials or licensure the revised guidelines are considered unlikely to be applicable to rna vaccines and development by who of separate documents covering rna vaccines is in progress6 in this issue of npj vaccines sheets et al provide an overview of the revision process to date report the outcomes from an informal consultation of subject matter experts held in december 2019 to review the draft revisions and discuss public comments that had been received and describe the timeline for further revision and subsequent approval and implementation of the new guidelines by the who expert committee on biological standardization during 2020 this communication is timely given the current global impacts of covid-19 and the rapid development of a large number of candidate vaccines including several based on dna or other nucleic acid platforms at the time of this report late april 2020 and only 23 months following initiation of their development a candidate dna vaccine clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04283461 and a candidate rna vaccine nct04336410 are in phase 1 clinical trials and more than a dozen other nucleic acid vaccine candidates are in development7 for the two vaccines now in phase 1 it seems that the rapid path to clinical testing was facilitated by both the short timelines for manufacturing of initial clinical lots and streamlined requirements for nonclinical safety testing based on prior nonclinical and clinical experience with those platforms78 evaluation of vaccine efficacy in newly developed animal models for covid-19 can be expected to proceed in parallel with clinical safety testing vaccine development against sars-cov-2 is benefiting from prior experience with other closely related emerging coronaviruses associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers currently there are no licensed vaccines for coronaviruses that cause respiratory diseases in humans and induction of robust and durable protective immunity against infection by sars-cov-2 through vaccination may be challenging furthermore the outcomes of nonclinical efficacy testing of some candidate vaccines for sars and mers suggests that another significant concern is the potential for immune potentiation of covid-19 lung disease811 the anticipated demand for hundreds of millions of doses for sars-cov-2 vaccines and their use in a wide range of target populations coupled with the likely limitations of manufacturing capacity and scalability for any single vaccine type suggests that engagement and coordination of multiple international partners for development of a portfolio of licensed vaccines based on multiple platforms will ideally be needed12 the current covid-19 pandemic will provide nucleic acid vaccine platforms their greatest opportunity to demonstrate in practice their proposed value as key components in the rapid response to controlling global or regional emerging infectious disease threats the availability of the revised who guidelines related to dna vaccines currently as a draft and subsequently in a final form should facilitate communications between vaccine developers and regulatory agencies as nucleic acid vaccine candidates progress towards possible licensure  porcine epidemic diarrhea virus jacqueline macdonald zayn khamis rima menassa   porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv is a coronavirus that causes porcine epidemic diarrhea ped in pigs its high mortality rate for piglets at 9095 stevenson et al 2013 is a key distinguishing factor between pedv and the similar transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev in suckling piglets the pedv incubation period is around two days varying from 1 to 8 days diarrhea and vomiting can develop within 24 h and as a result dehydration anorexia and severe weight loss occur in older pigs and sows morbidity varies and the period between onset and end of clinical symptoms is 34 weeks lee 2015 stevenson et al 2013
 the first known pedv outbreaks occurred in europe in the 1970s and 1990s including in belgium pensaert and de bouck 1978 and hungary nagy et al 1996 while pedv has since posed less of a threat to europe it has re-emerged in italy martelli et al 2008 germany hanke et al 2015 and france grasland et al 2015 affecting pigs of all ages pedv spread to asia in the early 1980s where it was first detected in japan in 1982 and then in south korea china and thailand chen et al 2014 since october 2010 china has seen a severe outbreak of pedv resulting in high porcine mortality rates and economic losses sun et al 2012 pedv was first detected in the united states us in may 2013 stevenson et al 2013 and then in canada in january 2014 ojkic et al 2015 these two countries have experienced severe economic losses due to the death of millions of suckling piglets and to diarrhea-derived weight loss in fattening pigs chen et al 2014 the north american serotypes are most closely related to a recently emerged chinese serotype huang et al 2013 and since the north american epidemic they have spread to south korea taiwan and japan lee 2015 while a few vaccines are available against pedv those targeting the asian strains are not effective against the north american strains while the effectiveness of a conditionally approved vaccine in the us is unknown see below by vaccinating sows with an effective vaccine the suckling piglets can receive lactogenic immunity through iga antibodies secreted into the milk bae et al 2003 and may be spared from vertical transmission of pedv from sow milk sun et al 2012 pedv primarily enters pigs bodies through the fecal-oral route although airborne transmission may play a role alonso et al 2014 diarrhea and vomiting result in the spread of pedv through contaminated environmental sources including pigs trailers clothing lowe et al 2014 sows milk sun et al 2012 feed and feed-supplements such as spray-dried porcine plasma pasick et al 2014 highlighting the importance of biosecurity pedv causes sickness through its actions in the intestines of pigs the virus enters porcine enterocytes which line the inner surface of the intestines via interaction between the viral s protein and the enterocyte aminopeptidase n which acts as a cellular receptor for pedv through this receptor pedv enters the enterocyte cells where new virions assemble by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus membranes ducatelle et al 1981 li et al 2007 once pedv enters enterocytes it causes them to undergo acute necrosis jung et al 2014 pedv also causes a reduction in the number of goblet cells the cells which secrete mucins to defend against microbial infection jung and saif 2015 cytolysis additionally leads to shortening and severe atrophy of intestinal villi and causes the tips of villi to erode or become covered with attenuated epithelial cells jung et al 2014 stevenson et al 2013 the atrophy of intestinal villi results in microscopic lesions which are typical of an enteritic infection sueyoshi et al 1995 pedv also results in swollen cells and the detachment of cells from adjacent cells and from the membranes of the basal surfaces stevenson et al 2013 these factors inhibit the pigs ability to absorb water and nutrients and result in the malabsorption and diarrhea discussed above to produce an effective vaccine against pedv it is important to understand the structure of the virus the coronavirinae subfamily consists of three genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus pedv is an enveloped alphacoronavirus encoded by a 28 kilobase single-stranded positive-sense rna genome song and park 2012 coronaviruses have the largest known rna genomes of all viruses king 2011 the pedv genome has seven open reading frames orfs which code for three non-structural polyproteins and four structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n these open reading frames are flanked by a 5 cap and a 3 polyadenylated tail figs 1 and 2 song and park 2012 the orfs encoding the non-structural proteins consist of two overlapping open reading frames orf1a and orf1b encoding two polyproteins these polyproteins are processed by three virus-encoded proteases a 3c-like proteinase 3clpro and two papain-like proteinases plp which results in 16 non-structural proteins required for genome replication and mrna transcription john et al 2016 prentice et al 2004 the accessory protein orf3 is a potassium ion channel but its role is not well defined wang et al 2012 reports on transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev another alphacoronavirus indicate that s and e are only present in the virion in small quantities with e estimated to occur 20 times in a virion godet et al 1992 n and m occur in higher numbers at a ratio of 1n3m king 2011 a recent study examining mouse hepatitis virus mhv a betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus sars-cov a betacoronavirus and feline coronavirus fcov an alphacoronavirus has determined that coronaviruses have approximately 1100 m dimers 90 s trimers and n proteins in a ratio from 3m1n to 1m1n neuman et al 2011 thus m is the most abundant structural protein displayed at the viral surface

 of the four structural proteins s and m are the most antigenic to date the s protein has been the primary focus of subunit vaccine design due to its antigenicity and the role it plays in viral entry as it regulates interactions with host cell receptor protein aminopeptidase n bosch et al 2003 s contains three antigenic regions the first epitope that was recognized spans amino acids 14951913 called the co-26k equivalent coe this epitope induced a neutralizing immune response and was identified through sequence homology with tgev which induces similar clinical symptoms in pigs chang et al 2002 subsequently the motif spanning amino acids 13681374 and the epitope region from amino acids 636789 have also been found to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies cruz et al 2008 sun et al 2006 while s is antigenic the use of s as a subunit vaccine poses challenges s has been shown to be prone to mutations through serial passages sato et al 2011 and has high genetic variability among pedv strainsstrains have even been found with 582 nucleotide deletions in the s gene masuda et al 2015 indeed the variability of s makes it the gene of choice to study the genetic relatedness of different pedv strains chen et al 2014 the difference in amino acid sequence between the s protein of different strains can lead to different epitopes being presented and may explain why previous vaccines have failed to provide effective immunity against infectious strains sun et al 2012 nonetheless due to the early recognition of the antigenic importance of the protein pedv recombinant protein production has focussed on s work has been done to produce s or s epitopes in escherichia coli van noi and chung 2017 lactobacillus casei ge et al 2012 and via the orf virus as a vaccine delivery vector hain et al 2016 however most recombinant pedv s production has occurred in plants with all of these plants producing s-coe the protein yield has varied widely as has the plant host utilized historically tobacco has been the most established and developed platform for high-yield plant-based recombinant protein production conley et al 2011 as such it follows suit that five of the fourteen reports of s-coe production were carried out using tobacco table 1 four of the reports expressed s-coe in a stable transgenic line with yields between 01 of tsp kang et al 2005b and 21 of tsp depending on codon optimization kang et al 2005a while one reported transient production at 5 of tsp kang et al 2004
 many of the alternative plant choices resulted in yields that were either not quantified or very low despite often using the same promoters and enhancers as the tobacco studies like the tobacco studies a double-enhanced 35s 2x35s cauliflower mosaic virus camv promoter was used in carrot and potato expression experiments expression in potato reached 01 of tuber tsp while expression in carrot was not reported kim et al 2003 2005 expression of s-coe has also been reported in lemna minor 35s promoter not quantified ko et al 2011 sweet potato 35s promoter not quantified yang et al 2005 and corn 2x35s 0122 tsp kun et al 2014 the use of fusion proteins particularly the heat-labile enterotoxin b subunit of escherichia coli ltb have recently gained popularity in subunit vaccine design and have been utilized in the production of s-coe three studies have expressed such fusions in rice which has shown promise in reaching equivalent accumulation levels as tobacco rice was used to express s-coe both in the endosperm and in calli while accumulation levels in the calli using the rice -amylase 3d promoter ramy3d only reached 0083 for a s-coe-m cell-targeting ligand co1 fusion huy et al 2012 accumulation levels in the endosperm for ltb-s-coe using the wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunit bx17 endosperm-specific promoter hmw-bx17-p and rice actin first intron act1-i reached 13 and 19 oszvald et al 2007 tams 2010 ltb-coe has also been produced in tobacco reaching comparative levels of 16 tsp kang et al 2006 so far only three studies have tested the immunogenicity of plant-produced s-coe ltb-s-coe produced in tobacco was able to bind to the gm1-ganglioside intestinal membrane receptor kang et al 2006 more directly mice orally immunized with co1-s-coe fusion protein produced in rice calli had threefold and eightfold higher levels of igg and iga secreting cells in their lymphocytes respectively compared to unimmunized mice huy et al 2012 while this is encouraging in order for a vaccine to be effective the antibodies produced must be virus-neutralizing bae et al 2003 took this next step showing that feeding ground lyophilized transgenic tobacco containing s-coe was able to induce an immune response in mice that could inhibit pedv plaque formation by 497 in comparison to controls while full immunity was not conferred by the mounted immune response this study marks the most significant achievement to date in plant-based pedv vaccine research m is the other antigenic protein of pedv and the most abundant component of the viral envelope utiger et al 1995 in contrast to s m is more conserved showing 55 the number of mutations as s after 100 serial passages chen et al 2014 sato et al 2011 the use of a protein that remains stable is important for subunit vaccine design to ensure that a vaccine can be used for a wide variety of strains and locations the m protein of tgev and sars-cov show virus-neutralizing activity in the presence of complement the component of the immune system that enhances the ability of antibodies to clear pathogens this virus-neutralizing activity was demonstrated to be higher or comparable to the neutralizing capacity of 8 individual s protein fragments pang et al 2004 woods et al 1988 through sequence homology with infectious bronchitis virus ibv a gammacoronavirus m was found to have a b-cell epitope on its c-terminus from amino acids 195200 zhang et al 2012 however it is likely that with further research sequence homology studies will find more epitopes on pedv m for example the m protein of sars-cov has b-cell epitopes on the n and c-termini he et al 2005 and two cytotoxic t-cell epitopes in the second and third transmembrane domain liu et al 2010 while the m protein of mhv has a cd4 t-cell epitope on its c-terminus xue et al 1995 expression of m transiently in n benthamiana as a fusion with elastin-like polypeptide khamis 2016 resulted in the production of virus-like particles vlps an important development of subunit vaccine design while subunit vaccines have previously failed to completely protect piglets from pedv infection due to subpar immunogenicity vlps are more immunogenic because they resemble the native structure of the virion plant-made vlps for influenza are shown to induce four- to six-fold higher levels of antibody response than fifty times more flu antigen not in vlps daoust et al 2008 the ability to produce pedv vlps using m may lead to the first commercial plant-produced pedv vaccine much of the pedv vaccine research has occurred in asia where outbreaks have been most severe but none of the produced vaccines are completely effective against asian pedv strains song and park 2012 available asian vaccines are based on strains that are genetically different from those sequenced in the us that are currently causing epidemics globally huang et al 2013 this has been on display in china where vaccinated herds experienced pedv breakouts that were found to be due to newer strains of the virus li et al 2012 two pedv vaccines were given conditional licenses in the us by the united states department of agriculture usda the first was a vaccine originally produced by harrisvaccines inc and is based on their sirravaxsm rna platform using this platform part of the rna genome of a venezuelan equine encephalitis alphavirus is replaced with a gene for pedv s protein after injection with genetic material the pigs dendritic cells produce the s protein and an immune response is launched against the produced protein harrisvaccines 2015 merck animal health acquired harrisvaccines in 2015 merck animal health 2015 but the product is still sold under a conditional license in the us where safety and field trials are ongoing the second conditionally licensed pedv vaccine in the us is an inactivated virus particle vaccine produced by zoetis inc zoetis 2016 efficacy and potency studies are still in progress for the zoetis vaccine and duration of immunity has not been evaluated it must be refrigerated and used all at once when opened zoetis 2016 a third vaccine candidate is being developed by vido-intervac vaccine and infection disease organizationinternational vaccine centre in canada and is currently undergoing field testing this vaccine candidate is a subunit s1 protein expressed in mammalian hek-293 t cells and although it induced production of neutralizing antibodies it was not fully protective to suckling piglets makadiya et al 2016 none of the pedv vaccines used commercially at least in the us and canada are made in planta the ability to vaccinate orally through feeding plant tissue is important as song et al 2007 demonstrated that oral vaccination was more effective than injection for their pedv vaccine when comparing oral to intramuscular administration of their attenuated virus vaccine song et al found that more igas were produced by orally vaccinated pigs and that the mortality rate for this group was 13 in comparison to 60 for the intramuscular group current vaccines on the market are also either based on s which is prone to mutations or are killed or live attenuated vaccines live attenuated vaccines present risks as they can potentially mutate and become pathogenic again and allow for genome segment re-assortment on farmsone chinese pedv strain is thought to have evolved from a live attenuated vaccine chen et al 2010 inactivated vaccines in comparison are safer but have a high cost of production and present concerns over the reliability of inactivation methods calvo-pinilla et al 2014 both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines rule out the possibility of using distinguish infected from vaccinated animals diva assays as they contain the entire virus as such the market has a need of an effective subunit vaccine based on the current infectious strains further research on current plant-made candidates could prove to fill this need while proof of concept studies show that s-coe can be produced in plants many of these studies show poor yields generally even when higher yields are reported the push forward to testing the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates does not occur there have been two instances where the direct immunogenicity of plant-produced s-coe has been tested the first was incomplete as it did not test whether the mounted immune response was virus-neutralizing huy et al 2012 the other candidate that successfully took steps to test immunogenicity was the vaccine candidate produced by bae et al 2003 however while the immune response in mice inhibited pedv plaque formation by 497 in comparison to controls complete immunity was not achieved bae et al 2003 likely due to this and due to the need for higher expression levels no further efforts were made with this vaccine candidate generally even when higher expression levels have been obtained kang et al 2004 immunogenicity was not tested and research focused on increasing expression levels and not on producing an immunogenic commercial product the focus on s-coe has left a gap in the research on plant production of other pedv proteins however our recent results have shown that m can be produced in planta and that vlps can be produced for pedv khamis 2016 vlps represent a step-forward for subunit vaccine design demonstrating higher immunogenicity than regular subunit vaccines in the future advances in subunit vaccine design such as vlps and a commitment to improving yields and testing immunogenicity and protective immune responses to these vlps may lead to the commercialization of a plant-produced subunit pedv vaccine  live-attenuated bivalent measles virus-derived vaccines targeting middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus induce robust and multifunctional t cell responses against both viruses in an appropriate mouse model bianca bodmer s anna fiedler h jan hanauer rh steffen prfer michael mhlebach d   the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a member of the coronaviridae family and emerged in 2012 in the kingdom of saudi arabia zaki et al 2012 coronaviruses typically cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract but already in 2002 the severe acute respiratory syndrome cov sars-cov with a mortality rate of about 10 among infected patients was introduced in the human population sars-cov spread world-wide and caused more than 8000 diagnosed infections but was contained within a year after its emergence httpwwwwhointcsrsarscountrytable20040421en in contrast infections with mers-cov are ongoing for more than 5 years with 2103 laboratory-confirmed cases distributed over 27 countries with at least 733 deaths that were reported to the who by november 2017 httpwwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven this apparent case-fatality rate of 35 is of grave concern because epidemic spread as has been observed for sars-cov could result in a disastrous death toll mers-cov has been introduced zoonotically by transmission from dromedary camels to human patients alagaili et al 2014 haagmans et al 2014 reusken et al 2013a and serological studies indicate wide-spread and early distribution among this animal host alagaili et al 2014 reusken et al 2013b therefore a continuous risk of transmission especially to persons in close contact to camels is evident fortunately the human to human transmission rate has remained low aside of individuals with regular contact to camels only health care workers or relatives of mers-cov patients have a considerable risk of infection alraddadi et al 2016 drosten et al 2014 but still at a modest level nonetheless the high case fatality rate the recurrent outbreaks of mers-cov infections and especially the risk of virus adaptation potentially resulting in epidemic or even pandemic spread make the development of an effective vaccine against mers-cov an international priority the efficacy of several vaccine candidates has been demonstrated in different animal models up to even dromedary camels reviewed in okba et al 2017 one of these candidates mvvac2-mers-sh malczyk et al 2015 is based on the measles virus mv vaccine platform technology mhlebach 2017 and encodes the mers-cov spike protein s as an additional antigen in the backbone of recombinant mvvac2 del valle et al 2007 resembling vaccine strain moraten that is authorized and in use in the us since 1968 this candidate induces both robust humoral and functional cellular immune-responses against mers-cov moreover mers-cov viral load and inflammation of the lung were significantly reduced in challenged mice that had been vaccinated with mvvac2-mers-sh before malczyk et al 2015 while these experiments provided proof of concept for efficacy of this vaccine candidate further mechanistic insights into the nature of the induced t cell responses remain to be elucidated these are of special interest since it has been shown that t cells are essential for clearance of the infection coleman et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 depletion of cd8 t cells increased overall inflammation bronchiolar inflammation lymphocyte infiltration and pleuritis at day 7 post-infection in mice coleman et al 2017 while mers cov-susceptible mice depleted of all t cells were unable to clear the virus zhao et al 2014 as an alternative to the spike glycoprotein conserved internal structural proteins such as the nucleocapsid protein n are of special interest as putative target of anti-viral t cell responses to be triggered by future mers vaccines agnihothram et al 2014 therefore we have also generated and characterized mers-cov n protein-encoding vaccine candidates based on the mvvac2 vaccine platform in this study to further characterize the induction of mers cov-specific immune responses we first analyzed the necessity for viral replication for the induction of mers cov- and mv-specific immune responses using the highly immunogenic mvvac2-mers-sh vaccine candidate in addition we characterized the functionality of cd8 and cd4 t cell responses in juvenile 612 week old and adult 7 months of age mice using flow cytometry and functional assays vero african

fig 1a while growth kinetics showed no impairment of virus replication compared to the respective mvvac2-gfpp control virus fig 1 b c to test the efficacy of the mvvac2-mers-n candidate in vivo genetically modified ifnar---cd46ge mice were chosen since they are the prime small animal model for analysis of mv-derived vaccines mrkic et al 1998 thus 6 mice per group were inoculated via the intraperitoneal ip route on days 0 and 28 with each time 1  105 tcid50 of mvvac2-mers-np mvvac2-mers-nh or empty control virus mvvac2-atup medium-inoculated mice served as negative controls 21 days or four days after boost immunization sera or splenocytes of immunized mice were sampled respectively fig 1d as expected all mice immunized with recombinant mv including the control virus developed high mv virus neutralizing titers vnt 5122048 vnt fig 1f little evidence for induction of neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov was found in all mice as expected for the intra-particular antigen fig 1e no vnts against mv or mers-cov were detected in control mice inoculated with medium alone to analyze splenocytes of animals vaccinated with mvvac2-mers-nh or control animals inoculated with medium or mvvac2-atup by elispot assay for antigen-specific ifn- secretion the antigen-specific t cells were re-stimulated in vitro by syngeneic murine dc cell lines jawsii and dc24 which had been genetically modified by lentiviral vector transduction to stably express mers-n protein and thereby to present the respective t cell epitopes on mhc single cell clones were derived by flow cytometric sorting of single gfp-positive cells antigen expression by transduced dcs was verified by western blot analysis data not shown elispot assays using splenocytes of vaccinated animals in co-culture with jawsii-mers-n or dc24-mers-n revealed about 200 ifn- secreting cells per 1  106 splenocytes after immunization with mvvac2-mers-nh fig 1g which was significant over controls additionally cellular immune responses targeting mv antigens were detected upon stimulation with mv bulk antigens in vaccinated mice that had received any recombinant virus as expected however mv bulk antigens stimulated about 9301500 ifn- secreting cells per 1  106 splenocytes of mv vaccinated animals as described before malczyk et al 2015 finally splenocytes of all mice revealed a similar basic reactivity to unspecific t cell stimulation as confirmed by similar numbers of ifn- secreting cells upon cona treatment fig 1g thus the generated mv-based vaccine platform expressing mers-n induces significant mers n-specific cellular immune responses as desired in any case humoral and cellular responses induced by vaccine candidate mvvac2-mers-s had been considerably higher in previous analyses under similar conditions malczyk et al 2015 therefore further characterization of anti-mers-cov immunity induced by mvvac2-derived vaccines proceeded with this mers-s encoding vaccine candidate which yielded approximately 5-fold higher numbers of reactive t cells after vaccination since the mers vaccine candidate mvvac2-mers-sh induced robust protective humoral and cellular immune responses in ifnar-
--cd46ge mice malczyk et al 2015 we were interested in the necessity of viral replication of this life-attenuated vaccine for the induction of mers cov-specific immunity for these analyses ifnar---cd46ge mice were chosen as the animal model again since these mice are the standard animal model for analysis of mv-derived vaccines mhlebach 2017 their genetic composition is compatible with an established mers-cov challenge model zhao et al 2014 as shown before malczyk et al 2015 and their size allows housing under regularly available conditions opposed to dromedary camels the only know natural host of mers-cov to date as all morbilliviruses the mv-based vaccine virions are highly cell-associated and transfer of antigenic protein within the vaccine preparation cannot be excluded therefore we vaccinated these mv-susceptible mice with either 1  105 tcid50 of live or of the same formulation and quantity uv-inactivated mvvac2-mers-sh in a prime-boost regimen 
fig 2a mvvac2-atup which does not encode any additional antigen was included as vector control blood was drawn from nave mice on day 0 before vaccination and on days 28 and 49 post-immunization serum samples were tested for their ability to neutralize mvvac2-gfpp fig 2b d f or mers-cov fig 2c e g sera of nave mice had no neutralizing antibodies against either virus fig 2b c after the first immunization both live virus preparations induced neutralizing antibodies against mv with mvvac2-atup triggering significantly higher titers 12801920 vnt than mvvac2-mers-sh 480640 vnt after the second immunization anti-mv vnts increased to titers of 6402560 in both cohorts in contrast only one out of four animals in the uv-inactivated vaccine group had a borderline neutralizing antibody titer of 20 after the first immunization and another animal had a titer of 30 after the boost while mvvac2-atup and the uv-inactivated mvvac2-mers-sh vaccine did not induce neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov above background levels over the course of the experiment the group vaccinated with live mvvac2-mers-sh developed titers around 50 after the first immunization and 40320 mean of 300 after the boost taken together these data reveal that replication of the vaccine is necessary to induce functional antibody responses against mv and the additional antigen mers-s to assess the capacity of the different mvvac2-mers-sh vaccine preparations to induce mers-cov s-specific cellular immune responses splenocytes of mice which had already been tested for humoral responses fig 2a were isolated and analyzed 49 days after immunization for antigenag-dependent ifn- secretion using elispot assay the isolated splenocytes were re-stimulated with mers-s immunodominant peptide s1165 channappanavar et al 2014 or mv bulk antigen mv bulk to analyze mv-specific cellular immune responses ovalbumin-derived siinfekl-peptide sin served as peptide negative control or cells were left untreated mock stimulation with concanavalin a cona was used to confirm general t cell reactivity in splenocyte preparations fig 2h while splenocytes of all mice responded to cona with 1000 to 1500 spots per 1  106 splenocytes only those from animals vaccinated with live mvvac2-mers-sh could be stimulated with mers s-specific peptide s1165 reaching mean values of 1040 spots per 1  106 splenocytes in contrast splenocytes of the uv-inactivated group or control virus mvvac2-atup could not be re-stimulated to secrete ifn- furthermore only replication-competent vaccine viruses induced mv-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice re-stimulation with mv bulk ag induced a mean of 800 and 970 spots per 1  106 splenocytes for mvvac2-mers-sh or mvvac2-atup vaccinated mice respectively consequently replication of the vaccine candidate is essential to induce both arms of the immune system with responses against mv as well as the additional mers-s antigen usually 612 weeks old juvenile mice are used for our immunization studies to evaluate if there is an age-dependent change in vaccination efficacy approximately 7 months-old mice were vaccinated with mvvac2-mers-sh in a prime-boost vaccination scheme with 3 weeks between prime and boost vaccination 
fig 3a mice were sacrificed at day 42 post-immunization and splenocytes were re-stimulated with mv-antigens or mers-s peptide s1165 we found that reactive ifn--secreting t cells were also specifically induced in mice of this age fig 3b a mean of 520 spots per 1  106 splenocytes was detected upon re-stimulation with mv bulk antigen whereas 900 spots per 1  106 splenocytes were induced by re-stimulation with the mers s-derived peptide s1165 illustrating that mv- and mers-cov-specific cellular immune responses are effectively induced in adult mice to gain more detailed insights in the quality of the observed t cell responses we further characterized the responsive t cell populations by flow cytometry determining the expression of cd8 and cd4 surface markers as well as ifn- and tnf- upon re-stimulation with s1165 or mv bulk antigen as a positive stimulus for t cell activation tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate and ionomycin tpaiono were used exocytosis of cytokines was blocked by addition of brefeldin a 10 gml during stimulation cells were permeabilized labelled and fixed for flow cytometry the gating strategy excluded duplicates not shown selected for living cells

middle panel with means of 06 and 04 of total positive cells respectively among those a significant fraction of cells revealed to be multifunctional with a mean of 03 of all cd8 cells or 75 of the tnf-  responsive cells being positive for both cytokines fig 4d right panel moreover vaccination induced a significant fraction of vector-specific cd4 t cells expressing ifn- fig 4e left panel or tnf- fig 4e middle panel upon re-stimulation with mv bulk antigen among those multifunctional cd4 t cells expressing both cytokines were induced with a mean of about 01 fig 4e right panel to conclude vaccination with mvvac2-mers-sh induces not only ifn- or tnf- expressing t cells directed against mers-cov and mv but also a significant fraction of multi-functional cytotoxic t cells specific for mers-s and cd4 t cells specific for mv antigens illustrating that a broad and robust mers-cov-specific immune response is induced by vaccination with mvvac2-mers-sh in this study we aimed to understand the induction of immunity and the functionality of induced t cell responses after vaccination with mvvac2-mers-sh a vaccine candidate that induces protective immunity against mers-cov in an appropriate animal model in parallel we generated and tested also alternative mv-based vaccine candidates expressing mers-cov n protein as conserved t cell antigen mvvac2-mers-n vaccine candidates indeed induced significant antigen-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated transgenic mice revealing that also mers n-expression by recombinant mv may have a useful role to combat mers-cov since the immune responses induced by mers-s expressing candidates had been nevertheless considerably higher we proceeded with s-expressing vaccine virus to characterize the induction of anti-mers-cov immunity by mv-based vectors using mvvac2-mers-sh robust anti-mers cov immune responses were induced also in older mice while replication of the vaccine vector was necessary to induce either arm of adaptive immunity against vector or pathogen furthermore vaccination with mvvac2-mers-sh triggered significant numbers of multifunctional mers s-specific cd8 t cells and mv-specific cd4 t cells simultaneously producing ifn- and tnf- upon stimulation with respective antigens since not only numbers but also the quality of the induced mers cov-specific t cell responses might be relevant for protection against mers-cov it is quite encouraging to see that approx 50 of ifn- reactive cd8 t cells also expressed tnf- whereas in reverse 75 of tnf--reactive cd8 t cells co-expressed ifn- upon stimulation with the immune-dominant mers-s peptide this induction of multifunctional t cells is quite in accordance with previous studies since the potential of mv during natural infection or the recombinant mv to induce multifunctional antigen-specific t cells has already been demonstrated infection of macaques with wild-type mv induces polyfunctional t cells specific for mv proteins with increasing numbers of cells secreting il-2 tnf- as well as ifn- over time nelson et al 2017 and polyfunctional t cells directed against mv-h can be expanded from pbmc of human donors ndhlovu et al 2010 likewise hiv-vaccine candidates mv1-f4 which encode gag rt and nef of an hiv-1 clade b or a clade c strain as foreign antigen induce antigen-specific multifunctional t cells simultaneously expressing ifn- tnf- and il-2 in mice and also macaques stebbings et al 2013 stebbings et al 2012 while the combination of ifn- and tnf- indicates functional t cells with higher potency in general expression of il-2 is a sign of the induction of cd8 memory t cells williams et al 2006 in our study the strong correlation of ifn- and tnf- expression thus indicates a high functionality of induced t cell responses extension of the antibody panel for il-2 detection could yield further insight into the durability of these t cell responses induced by the mv vaccine platform in future studies such multifunctional cd8 t cells specific for mers-cov may become especially important since mouse studies have shown that cd8 t cells are crucial for clearance of mers-cov infection coleman et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 noteworthy for other viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv modified vaccinia virus ankara mva or cytomegalovirus cmv the amount of just ifn- producing t cells does not correlate with ctl killing effectivity but the multifunctionality of antigen-specific t cells inversely correlated with viral load betts et al 2006 lichterfeld et al 2004 precopio et al 2007 sandberg et al 2001 further underlining the importance of multifunctionality besides these cellular immune responses also considerable humoral immunity was induced in vaccinated animals here the mean vnt was somewhat lower than expected malczyk et al 2015 but still quite high an alternative vaccine candidate derived from modified vaccinia virus ankara mva-mers-s revealed protection in dromedary camels the natural host for mers-cov haagmans et al 2016 passive immunotherapy with dromedary immune sera significantly reduced mers-cov titers in lung tissue of challenged mice starting with a vnt of 160 zhao et al 2015 neutralizing antibody titers in reconvalescent plasma of human patients diagnosed with mers were determined by microneutralization tests in two previous studies and were on average at 175 arabi et al 2016 or 583 zhao et al 2017 furthermore a prnt50 titer of at least just 50 was required to lower virus titers by more than 05 log in mice challenged after transfer of human reconvalescent plasma zhao et al 2017 these titers were exceeded in this study in addition mvvac2-mers-sh induced higher anti-mers-s titers in c57bl6 mice than mva-mers-s in balbc mice when comparing studies that used similar virus titers for vaccination malczyk et al 2015 volz et al 2015 thus indicating an at least comparable efficacy thus also vnt determined here indicate efficacy and were anyway not statistically different from those published before for mvvac2-mers-sh malczyk et al 2015 nevertheless the exact correlates of protection for mers-cov remain to be determined in future studies since it will be essential to evaluate the efficacy of the different vaccine candidates against this most important benchmark in contrast uv-inactivated mvvac2-mers-sh did not induce any antibodies able to neutralize mers-cov or mv while neutralizing antibodies can in principle also be induced by inactivated vaccines or proteins eg full-length or truncated mers-s protein in combination with adjuvant wang et al 2015 obviously the amount of mers-s antigen within the mvvac2-mers-sh vaccine formulation or the adjuvant effect of the inactivate were not sufficient during application therefore replication of the mv-derived mers vaccine candidate is necessary for the induction of immune responses both against vector and antigen of interest in vaccinated animals indeed the induction of cellular immunity is usually more efficient by de novo expression of antigen after immunization consequently the application of a replication competent vaccine platform is justified here to robustly induce potent responses of both arms of the adaptive immune system these powerful immune responses were not only induced in juvenile mice 612 weeks of age but also in adult mice older than half a year of age this is quite of interest since adult vaccinees are also the target group for vaccination in response to the mers-cov outbreak as defined in the target product profile by the who httpwwwwhointblueprintwhatresearch-developmentmerscovtpp 15052017pdf remarkably mv vaccine strain virus encoding chikungunya virus chikv antigens was already tested in a phase i clinical trial in adult human vaccinees 1845 years old ramsauer et al 2015 these adult test subjects all developed significant humoral immunity against chikv despite their adult age and most interestingly also independent from measles pre-immunity taken together these study shows that mvvac2-mers-sh induces surprisingly high numbers of multifunctional t cells specific for mers-s also in adult test subjects as a result from replication of the recombinant vector therefore high quality cellular immune responses are induced in addition to the robust antibody responses by this vaccine candidate further qualifying mvvac2-mers-sh for evaluation as vaccine candidate against mers-cov in parallel mers-n encoding mv can be a further option to generate protection against mers in future studies and

disease caused by a novel -coronavirus -cov mers coronavirus mers-cov mers-cov was first identified in humans in saudi arabia on june 12 2012 zaki et al 2012 although the spread of mers-cov among humans has been limited mers-cov infection has been linked to several family clusters and healthcare workers assiri et al 2013 memish et al 2013b memish et al 2013c providing evidence for human-to-human transmissibility of the virus mers-cov has demonstrated an increasing trend of infection since its first identification sporadic mers cases have been reported in at least 21 countries in the middle east africa europe asia and north america as of november 7 2014 a total of 909 laboratory-confirmed cases including 331 deaths mortality rate 36 were reported httpwwwwhointcsrdon07-november-2014-mersen the geographic spread and rapid increase of mers cases during the past several months have raised concerns of pandemic potential even though the consequences of such pandemic might be less severe than those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov another -cov which led to a worldwide outbreak in 2003 peiris et al 2003 as a practical control strategy against the potential outbreak of mers-cov-caused emerging infectious disease development of effective vaccines has become a high priority a number of studies have pointed out the transmission hosts for mers-cov it is reported that bat-derived coronaviruses particularly bat coronavirus hku4 have close phylogenetic relationship with mers-cov and that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 the receptor for mers-cov is also the receptor for hku4 while hku4 prefers bat dpp4 over human dpp4 mers-cov has adapted to use human dpp4 in addition to bind bat dpp4 suggesting that 1 bats are potential natural reservoirs for mers-cov and 2 bat coronaviruses remain a threat to human health because of their potential for cross-species transmission annan et al 2013 cui et al 2013 ithete et al 2013 memish et al 2013a yang et al 2014 in addition to bats camels have recently become a focus for the study of mers-cov transmission since mers-cov neutralizing antibodies and mers-cov gene

2014 nowotny and kolodziejek 2014 reusken et al 2013 the fact that humans were infected with mers-cov after exposure to infected camels suggests that camels are the most likely intermediate transmission hosts of mers-cov memish et al 2014 most recently mers-cov rna fragments were detected in an air sample collected from the barn that sheltered mers-cov-infected camels azhar et al 2014 indicating possible airborne transmission of mers-cov between animals and humans although the spread of mers-cov among humans is limited and inefficient drosten et al 2014 the increased infection rate among healthcare workers during the month of april 2014 httpwwwwhointcsrdiseasecoronavirusinfectionsarchiveupdatesen has raised concerns of future epidemic potential which call for the development of

lineage c -cov associated with human infections chan et al 2013b woo et al 2012 mers-cov is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus whose genome encodes four major structural proteins including spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n each with unique functions fig 1a the e protein is a transmembrane protein which forms an ion channel on the viral surface while the n protein interactively functions with the m protein and other n molecules encapsulating genomic rna hurst et al 2010 among the four structural proteins of mers-cov the s protein plays the most important roles in virus infection and pathogenesis it displays as a trimer on the viral membrane surface the precursor s protein is cleaved into two noncovalently associated subunits the distal subunit s1 and the membrane-anchored subunit s2 the mers-cov s1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain rbd including a core structure and an accessory subdomain receptor-binding motif rbm while the s2 subunit consists of a putative fusion peptide transmembrane domain and two heptad repeat regions termed heptad repeats 1 and 2 hr1 and hr2 fig 1b chen et al 2013b lu et al 2013a wang

2003 raj et al 2013 the crystal structures of sars-cov rbd complexed with its receptor ace2 have identified the rbd of sars-cov as residues 306527 and the rbm as residues 424494 li et al 2005 crystal structure analysis of mers-cov rbd alone or rbddpp4 complex has mapped the rbd to residues 367588 and 367606 respectively in the s protein of mers-cov with the rbm spanning residues 484567 chen et al 2013b lu et al 2013a wang et al 2013 fig 2
lists the crystal structures of sars-cov and mers-cov rbds and their complexes with respective receptors mers-cov undergoes two major processes to infect target cells first the virus binds to the cellular receptor dpp4 via the rbd in the s1 subunit second the hr1hr2 complex in the s2 subunit forms a fusion core leading to cell-virus membrane fusion thereby mediating mers-cov entry into the target cells gao et al 2013 lu et al 2014 therefore like sars-cov s protein the s protein of mers-cov plays an essential role in receptor binding membrane fusion and cell entry we have previously demonstrated that the s protein or more specifically the rbd of sars-cov played an essential role in developing sars vaccines du et al 2009a jiang et al 2012b it is thus expected that the rbd of mers-cov s protein will be an important target for developing vaccines against mers lu et al 2013b ma et al 2014b antibodies induced by sars-cov rbd do not cross-neutralize mers-cov infection since different receptors are recognized by the two coronaviruses suggesting that developing a safe and effective mers vaccine is a high priority du et al 2013b du et al 2013c since mers is a newly-emerged viral disease no vaccines have been developed for clinical use however a number of vaccine candidates have been tested andor proven effective in in vitro preclinical studies current updates on mers vaccine development including the possibility for developing certain vaccine types as candidates against mers are discussed below it was revealed that a recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara mva expressing the full-length mers-cov s protein mva-mers-s produced neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice against infections from mers-cov in cell cultures in vitro song et al 2013 providing a basis for developing viral vector-based mers vaccines in addition full-length infectious cdna clones of mers-cov have been constructed using reverse genetics systems and relevant infectious viruses could be rescued and propagated in vero a66 and huh-7 human liver cells almazn et al 2013 scobey et al 2013 reports have also shown that a full-genome sequence of mers-cov jordan-n32012 strain exhibited stability after sequential passages in two mammalian cell lines vero african green monkey kidney and mrc5 human lung frey et al 2014 the above studies indicate the potential for developing live-attenuated viruses as mers vaccine candidates moreover it was reported that high titers of specific antibodies with neutralizing activity can be generated in mice through vaccination with nanoparticles expressing the full-length mers-cov s protein suggesting the possibility of developing nanoparticle-based mers vaccines coleman et al 2014a in addition to the aforementioned vaccine types epitope-based and subunit vaccines also show promise against mers-cov infection or are under investigation for their efficacy for example recent studies in sequence analysis and computational prediction have identified an immunogenic and conserved epitope wdypkcdra in the rna-directed rna polymerase protein of human coronaviruses supporting the concept of designing and developing epitope-based universal vaccines against mers sharmin and islam 2014 additionally recombinant proteins containing rbd of mers-cov s protein are able to elicit strong neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated rabbits and mice respectively du et al 2013a du et al 2013c ma et al 2014a ma et al 2014b mou et al 2013 reinforcing the significance of developing protein-based subunit mers vaccines these candidate vaccines represent the first step in the control and prevention of mers-cov infection considerable evidence has shown that the sars-cov rbd contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes that induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies and is therefore a critical neutralization determinant for developing sars subunit vaccines he et al 2005a he et al 2005b it is believed that a recombinant fusion protein rbd-fc containing the rbd residues 318510 of sars-cov s protein fused with human igg1 fc fragment induced strong antibody responses with neutralizing activity and elicited long-term protective immunity in immunized rabbits and mice respectively completely protecting immunized mice from sars-cov challenge du et al 2007 he et al 2004 we have also identified that recombinant rbd proteins residues 318510 expressed in mammalian cells 293t and cho insect cell sf9 and escherichia coli respectively were able to elicit sufficient neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against sars-cov challenge in immunized mice among which the mammalian 293t cell-expressed rbd induced higher neutralizing antibody responses than those expressed in insect cell and e coli systems du et al 2009b du et al 2009c moreover the 293t-expressing rbd was capable of inducing high titers of protective anti-rbd antibody response in immunized nonhuman primates strongly neutralizing s protein-mediated sars pseudovirus infection in ace2-expressing target cells wang et al 2012 furthermore we have shown that a cho-expressing sars-cov rbd protein containing residues 318536 elicited potent neutralizing antibody response in immunized mice with complete protective immunity du et al 2010 and that a yeast-expressed rbd219n-1 protein induced strong rbd-specific neutralizing antibody responses against pseudovirus and live sars-cov infections chen et al 2013a interestingly the recombinant rbds from the s proteins of tor2 gd03 and sz3 the representative strains of human 20022003 and 20032004 sars-cov and palm civet sars-cov respectively elicited strong cross-neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits against pseudoviruses expressing s proteins of these virus strains the cross-neutralization of human and palm civet by sars-cov rbd-specific antibodies suggests that the rbd-based sars-cov subunit vaccines are able to induce broad cross-protective immunity against human and animal sars-cov variants he et al 2006 it is noted that high titers of rbd-specific neutralizing antibodies persistently existed in recovered patients in a three-year follow-up study indicating that the rbd of sars-cov is highly immunogenic in humans cao et al 2010 thus providing the basis for the development of effective subunit vaccines to prevent sars-cov infections in humans currently this rbd-based subunit vaccine is in preclinical testing in small animal and primate animal challenge models in anticipation of manufacture for clinical evaluation in the next five years jiang et al 2012a the above summary suggests a paradigm that supports the development of a mers-cov subunit vaccine indicating that the rbd of mers-cov is an important target for the development of mers-cov subunit vaccines and will like its sars-cov counterpart induce strong neutralizing antibody responses against mers-cov infection du et al 2009a zhu et al 2013 to identify the rbd of mers-cov we initially aligned the sequences of mers-cov s protein with those of sars-cov s protein and found that residues 377662 in the mers-cov s protein shared similar core structures with sars-cov rbd increasing the likelihood that the rbd of mers-cov might be located in this region jiang et al 2013 a recombinant protein s377-662-fc containing residues 377662 of mers-cov s protein fused with fc fragment of human igg was expressed in the culture supernatant of mammalian cell 293t for the purpose of forming conformational structures and thus increasing immunogenicity du et al 2013c as expected the expressed recombinant protein was able to form a high molecular-weight molecule as shown in nonboiled samples in sds-page fig 3a left which was recognized by mers-cov s1-specific antibodies fig 3a right detection of the binding of s377-662-fc with the receptor of mers-cov dpp4 by co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that this protein bound significantly to soluble dpp4 sdpp4 and cell-associated dpp4 in dpp4-expressing huh-7 cells being recognized by anti-dpp4 and anti-mers-cov-s1 antibodies respectively fig 3b elisa and flow cytometry analyses indicated that s377-662-fc bound to sdpp4 and huh-7 in a dose-dependent manner du et al 2013c these data suggest that the expressed recombinant protein formed conformational structures and that the predicted 286-amino acid fragment contained mers-cov rbd further evaluation of the immunogenicity of the identified mers-cov rbd demonstrated that the expressed recombinant s377-662-fc protein induced mers-cov rbd-specific antibodies in mice subcutaneously sc immunized after two vaccinations resulting in the effective neutralization of mers-cov infection in vero e6 cells in vitro du et al 2013c indicating that this region may serve as an essential target for developing mers subunit vaccines as mers-cov is a mucosal pathogen any vaccination that induces the production of strong mucosal immune responses represented by mucosal iga would have increased potential for the prevention of mers-cov at the site of virus infection to test the ability of the identified mers-cov rbd as a potential mucosal vaccine we immunized mice using mers-cov s377-662-fc protein via the intranasal in pathway and then compared the systemic and mucosal immune responses and neutralizing antibodies induced by the in route with those elicited by the sc route evaluation of the humoral immune response demonstrated that intranasal boost vaccination of s377-662-fc induced levels of mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies as well as igg1 th2 and igg2a th1 subtypes as high as those induced via the sc route although igg antibody elicited through the in pathway proved to be relatively lower than that elicited through the sc route after a single vaccination ma et al 2014a similar to immunization by the sc route intranasal vaccination of s377-662-fc was also capable of eliciting effective long-term igg antibody responses particularly after multiple vaccinations fig 3c ma et al 2014a confirming the ability of s377-662-fc to induce strong humoral immune responses via the mucosal route comparison of the mucosal immune response illustrated that intranasal vaccination of s377-622-fc induced a significantly higher level of mers-cov s1-specific iga antibodies than that induced through the sc route in immunized mouse lungs fig 3d although the iga level was only slightly higher in immunized mouse sera via the in route compared to the sc route ma et al 2014a these data suggest that immunization of mers-cov s377-662-fc protein induced strong local mucosal immune responses by the in route rather than the sc route serum neutralizing antibody titers from intranasal vaccination of s377-662-fc protein maintained levels similar to those of the sc route after boost vaccination fig 3e however it is worth noting that these neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher in immunized mouse lungs in neutralizing mers-cov infections in target vero e6 cells via the in route rather than the sc route fig 3f potentially because of the higher titers of mucosal iga antibodies induced in the in-immunized mouse lungs ma et al 2014a it should be noted that s377-662-fc protein was also able to elicit mers-cov s1-specific cellular immune responses in immunized mouse spleens ma et al 2014a indicating that cellular immune response might also play a role in the prevention of mers-cov infection importantly since rbd-induced systemic humoral and mucosal immune responses neutralizing antibodies in particular correspond to the protection against sars-cov infection du et al 2007 it is expected that neutralizing antibodies induced by mers-cov rbd protein will correlate well with inhibition of mers-cov infection nevertheless based on the ability of mers-cov rbd protein to induce strong systemic and mucosal immune responses with neutralizing activity it is expected that mers-cov rbd-based vaccine is an effective and safe mucosal candidate for prevention of mers-cov infection in addition to the above identified 286-amino acid fragment containing residues 377662 three additional fragments respectively spanning residues 358588 367588 and 367606 of mers-cov s protein were defined as mers-cov rbd by other groups chen et al 2013b lu et al 2013a mou et al 2013 wang et al 2013 we have also shown that a truncated 212-amino acid fragment spanning s protein residues 377588 of mers-cov served as a rbd of mers-cov du et al 2013a to identify a critical neutralizing domain in the mers-cov rbd as an ideal mers vaccine candidate we compared these identified rbd fragments in terms of their antigenicity dpp4 receptor binding immunogenicity and neutralizing activity in order for the recombinant proteins to form suitable conformational structures and maintain sufficient bioactivity we fused each of these mers-cov rbd fragments to the fc of human igg and expressed the proteins in a mammalian cell expression system fig 4a previously this same strategy was implemented and proved to be successful in expressing rbd proteins of sars-cov and influenza virus du et al 2011 du et al 2013d li et al 2013 as expected all four mers-cov rbd proteins designated s377-588-fc s358-588-fc s367-588-fc and s367-606-fc respectively formed dimeric conformational structures and maintained good antigenicity ma et al 2014b reacting strongly with mers-cov rbd-specific monoclonal antibody mersmab1 developed in our laboratories fig 4b du et al 2014 although all proteins bound efficiently to sdpp4- and dpp4-expressing huh-7 cells their binding affinities were notably different with s377-588-fc as one of the proteins having the highest dpp4-binding activity fig 4c notably s377-588-fc also maintained stronger immunogenicity than the other proteins tested inducing significantly higher igg antibody responses in immunized mice fig 4d as well as igg1 th2 and igg2a th1 subtypes importantly s377-588-fc protein was shown to elicit the highest neutralizing antibody titers against infections from mers-cov fig 4e ma et al 2014b our study identified a truncated fragment spanning residues 377588 of mers-cov rbd as a critical neutralizing domain thus making it an ideal target for the development of subunit vaccines against infections from mers-cov ma et al 2014b the identification of this critical neutralizing rbd fragment provides a foundation for the rapid development of effective and safe subunit vaccines to prevent the spread of mers-cov in humans or the transmission from infected camels to humans vaccine candidates that have proved effective against mers-cov infections in in vitro culture conditions need to be evaluated in effective animal challenge models to confirm protective immunity mers-cov has been shown to cause transient lower respiratory tract infection in rhesus macaques and infected monkeys demonstrated clinical signs of diseases virus replication histological lesions and neutralizing antibody generation de wit et al 2013b yao et al 2014 demonstrating that monkeys can be used for testing the efficacy of mers candidate vaccines however this mers-cov animal model is not affordable for most researchers based on the high cost for purchasing and maintaining monkeys making it particularly urgent to develop small animal models of mers-cov infection zhang et al 2014 studies have shown that mers-cov is susceptible to human and nonhuman primate cell types including huh-7 a549 calu-3 caco-2 human and vero african green monkey but it is not susceptible to bhk hamster mefc57b16 and 3t3 mouse or ferret primary kidney cells chan et al 2013a tao et al 2013 van doremalen et al 2014 these findings correspond to the observation that mers-cov infects human and nonhuman primates but it does not replicate in small animals such as syrian hamsters mice and ferrets coleman et al 2014b de wit et al 2013a devitt 2013 raj et al 2014 van doremalen et al 2014 although small animal models for mers-cov are still lacking devitt 2013 researchers have made great progress towards the identification and development of an effective small animal model for mers-cov infections in particular it has been shown that mice are susceptible to mers-cov infection after prior transduction with an adenoviral vector expressing the receptor of mers-cov human dpp4 with infected mice developing pneumonia accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration and histopathological changes zhao et al 2014 thus such small animal models can provide a practical platform and an affordable means for evaluating the efficacy of current mers-cov vaccines accordingly transgenic dpp4 mouse models that integrate human dpp4 genes into the mouse genome are being established in several laboratories httpwwwnaturecomnewsbiologists-make-first-mouse-model-for-mers-114634 and are expected to be tested for vaccine efficacy in the near future development of effective vaccines is urgently needed to control the spread of emerging mers-cov infections while viral vector-based and live-attenuated virus-based vaccines have potential for providing effective immunity subunit vaccines will offer the safest means for prevention although subunit-based vaccines might induce less immunogenicity than the other vaccine types their efficacy can be significantly improved by rational design based on the structural analysis of rbd of mers-cov s protein and by identification of the most stable and critical neutralizing fragment of rbd while eliminating non-neutralizing epitopes through immunofocusing ma et al 2014b overall our strategies in the development of mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines will provide useful information for the design of effective vaccines against mers-cov and any other emerging coronaviruses that might cause future pandemics it is expected that such developed mers candidate vaccines will be tested for efficacy in preventing mers-cov infections in vivo once affordable small animal models for mers-cov have become available because serologic and neutralization responses against s proteins of mers-cov sars-cov and other coronaviruses share no to low levels of cross-reactivity within andor across subgroups it is advisable that mers-cov and other coronavirus vaccines be designed by considering construction of chimeric s protein containing neutralizing epitopes from variant virus strains agnihothram et al 2014 the authors declared no conflict of interest  epitope-based peptide vaccines predicted against novel coronavirus disease caused by sars-cov-2 li lin sun ting he yufei li wendong fan yubo zhang jing   the sars-cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 previously 2019-ncov has recently emerged as a human pathogen leading to millions of confirmed cases globally and more than 100000 deaths 1 the sars-cov-2 virus is an enveloped positive single-stranded rna coronavirus with a genome size of approximately 299 kb sars-cov-2 is closely related to several bat coronaviruses and the sars-cov virus 23 and all belong to the b lineage of the beta-coronaviruses 4 the transmission of sars-cov-2 appears to contain the way from human to human and from contact with infected surfaces and objects causing who to declare a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 30th 2020 5 6 7 structural proteins are important targets for vaccine and anti-viral drug development due to their indispensable function to fuse and enter into the host cell 8 sars-cov-2 utilizes glycosylated spike s protein to gain entry into host cells the s protein is a trimeric class i fusion protein and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cell membrane 1910 the s protein includes the receptor binding s1-subunit and the membrane fusion s2-subunit the s1 subunit receptor-binding domain rbd is specifically recognized by the host receptor when the s1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor the prefusion trimer is destabilized resulting in the shedding of the s1 subunit and the state transition of the s2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation 11 the critical function of the s protein can be a breakthrough in vaccine design and development the sars-cov-2 coronavirus membrane glycoprotein m protein is a 222 aa structural protein that is the most abundant in coronavirus and it is normally highly conserved as a candidate antigen for developing the sars-cov-2 vaccine 12 immunization with the full length of m protein was reported to be able to elicit neutralizing antibodies in sars patients 13 the sars-cov-2 coronavirus nucleocapsid phosphoprotein n protein is a 419 aa structural protein highly conserved with multiple functions including the formation of nucleocapsids signal transduction virus budding rna replication and mrna transcription 14 n protein is highly antigenic 89 of patients who developed sars produced antibodies to this antigen 15 the immunogenicity of e protein is limited owing to that it consists of 76109 aa in different coronaviruses with channel activity 16 therefore it is not suitable for use as an immunogen great efforts are being made for the discovery of antiviral drugs even so there are no licensed therapeutic or vaccine for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection available in the market developing an effective treatment for sars-cov-2 is therefore a research priority it is time-consuming and expensive to design novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies 1718 previously numerous methods including the whole virus dna subunit and virus-like particles were used in developing vaccines for sars and mers 19 20 21 22 there were epitopes screened to develop vaccine targets for sars-cov 23 and mers-cov 24 respectively these epitopes can be prepared by chemical synthesis techniques and are easier in quality control but structural modifications delivery systems and adjuvants are additionally required in the formulation due to the low immunogenicity caused by their low molecular weight and structural complexity 25 currently a set of b and t cell epitopes highly conserved in sars-cov-2 were identified from s and n proteins of sars-cov that may help develop sars-cov-2 vaccines 26 among those that can be analyzed b-cell can recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection t-cell and antibody reactions that may recover extreme respiratory infection thus we chose the method of immune-informatics which is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens b- and t- cell linear epitope prediction and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens in this manuscript we applied immuno-informatics approaches to identify potential b- and t-cell epitopes based on the s protein of sars-cov-2 the antigenicity of all the epitopes was estimated and the interactions with the human leukocyte antigen hla alleles were evaluated for mhc class-i epitopes allergenicity toxicity stability and physiochemical properties were also investigated for exploring the antigenicity stability and safety of the identified epitopes the conservation of all b- and t- cell epitopes were examined across all isolates from different locations some of these identified epitopes could be used as promising vaccine candidates the primary sequence of sars-cov-2 protein was retrieved from the ncbi database using accession number mn9089473 3 experimentally known 3d structure of sars-cov-2 s

afv531481 beta coronavirus oc43 yp0095552411 and beta coronavirus hku1 aat985801 the s m and n protein sequences of different sars-cov-2 virus strains were taken from an open-access database ngdc httpsbigdbigaccnncov where 55179 sars-cov-2 virus strains sequences were documented with 11813 mutations reported in the virus genome until june 25 2020 s protein is an important target for vaccine development because of its important function in entering the host cell m protein and n protein of coronavirus have also been reported to generate immunogenic epitopes therefore the physiochemical properties of sars-cov-2 s protein m protein and n protein were first examined by protparam demonstrating their amino acids aa and molecular weight 1273 aa and 14118 kda for s protein 222 aa and 2515 kda for m protein and 419 aa and 4563 kda for n protein supplementary table 1 110 aa and 103 aa were found as negatively and positively charged for s protein respectively there were 13 aa negatively and 21 aa positively charged for m protein and 36 aa negatively and 60 aa positively charged for n protein the theoretical iso-electric point pi of the s m and n protein were 624 951 and 1007 respectively the instability-index ii was computed to be 3301 for s protein 3914 for m protein and 5509 for n protein which categories the s protein as stable but not for m and n protein

the details of the physiochemical properties of sars-cov-2 s m and n protein can be seen in supplementary table 1 the secondary structure of s m and n protein were generated by psipred 34 showing that the beta strand 263 for s 243 for m 122 for n helixes 244 for s 401 for m 21 for n and coil 493 for s 356 for m 668 for n are present in structure for s m and n protein respectively supplementary fig

contained at least one functional residue highly conserved and exposed to investigate the presence of mutations in the b- and t-cell epitopes 51150 sequences of sars-cov-2 in the ngdc database were subjected to multiple sequence alignment of all selected epitopes four positions 408 414 415 417 were observed mutated in five of ten non-allergenic and non-toxic linear b-cell epitopes in rbd of s protein fig 4d supplementary table 10 mutations occurred in nine of 24 non-allergenic and non-toxic linear b-cell epitopes in non-rbd regions supplementary table 10 no mutations were observed in non-allergenic and non-toxic t-cell epitopes from s m and n protein the emergence of sars-cov-2 is a serious health threat for the whole society thus there is an urgent need for drugs and preventative measures the sars-cov-2 infection is characterized by lung infections with symptoms including fever cough and shortness of breath based on the information from cdc centers for disease control and prevention the symptoms can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus which can transmit from human to human or from contact with infected surfaces and objects 5 6 7 it is essential to identify immune epitopes as quickly as possible the s protein is crucial in the fuse and entry of the virus into host cells 1 therefore it is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies the specificity of epitope-based vaccines can be enhanced by selecting parts of s protein exposed on the surface 52 medical biotechnology is important in developing vaccines against sars-cov-218 while computer-based immune-informatics can improve time and economic effectiveness and therefore it is also an essential method in immunogenic analysis and vaccine development in this study we characterized the physio-chemical characteristics of the sars-cov-2 viral genome for epitope candidates and adopted an immune-informatics based pipeline with highly stringent criteria to identify s m and n protein targeted b- and t-cell epitopes that may potentially promote an immune response in the host the antigenicity flexibility solvent accessibility disulfide bonds of predicted epitopes were evaluated yielding a small repertoire of potential b-cell epitope and vaccine candidates allergenicity and toxicity analysis suggested the ten linear b-cell epitopes in rbd region are of non-allergen and non-toxin stability analysis revealed that they can not be digested by multiple enzymes also two mhc class-i and nine mhc class-ii binding t-cell epitopes were predicted to interact with numerous hla alleles and to be highly antigenic allergenicity toxicity and physiochemical properties of t-cell epitopes were analyzed to increase specificity and selectivity the stability and safety were confirmed by digestion analysis conservation anlaysis of seven known coronaviruses revealed that rbd region is not conserved mutations generated from 51150 sequences of sars-cov-2 in the ngdc database were observed in five of ten linear b-cell epitopes in rbd region the b- and t-cell mhc class i and ii epitopes without mutations would be considered to be vaccine candidates with full potentials of being antigenicity we predict the b- and t-cell epitopes identified here may assist the development of potent peptide-based vaccines to address the sars-cov-2 challenge particularly those epitopes without mutations from the conserved regions could generate immunity that is not only cross-protective across beta coronaviruses but also relatively resistant to ongoing virus evolution 47 the epitopes predicted here can also potentially be used in the design of more sensitive serological assays for epidemiological or vaccine efficiency assessments but the replication of sars-cov-2 must be error-prone which is similar to sars-cov with a reported mutation rate of 4  10-4 substitutionssiteyear 53 anti-viral vaccines are necessary to be developed before the predicted epitopes are potentially obsolete moreover our immune-informatics based pipeline also provides a framework to identify b- and t- cell epitopes for sars-cov-2 but not limited to a specific virus at the same time we also have to mention that there are limitations in predicting t-cell epitopes the prerequisite that an epitope can elicit t cell response is the epitope can bind to both mhc alleles and t cell receptors however the binding prediction between mhc alleles and an epitope is relatively more accurate and the binding between an epitope and t cell receptors is extremely difficult to be predicted in short these results here will be useful to guide the design and evaluation of efficient and specific serological assays against epitopes as well as help prioritize vaccine target designs during

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 poses a critical threat to human health there is no proven vaccine or specific drug to date which highlights the urgent need for rapid development of therapeutics for covid-19 to identify potentially repurposable drugs we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from us fda approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the gene expression perturbation data by chemicals from the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures lincs project with publically available single-cell rna sequencing dataset from mild and severe covid-19 patients we identified 281 fda approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against sars-cov-2 infection 10 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against covid-19 in conclusion we have identified a list of repurposable anti-sars-cov-2 drugs using a systems biology approach  coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease resulting from a life-threatening novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 it has spread rapidly throughout the globe causing 38 million infections and 260 thousand of deaths by early may 2020 1 2  sars-cov-2 is an enveloped rna virus that belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae which includes well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov as well as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 3  the advancement in the management of these coronaviruses and other viruses like influenza virus h1n1 and ebola infections have provided insight into treating covid-19 more than 300 active clinical trials for covid-19 are being performed 4 5  chloroquine 6 7 and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine 8  lopinavirritonavir 9 10 11  and remdesivir 7 12  developed for treating malaria human immunodeficiency virus hiv and ebola virus respectively have provided some benefits to treat covid-19 and are being tested in ongoing trials although covid-19 is less fatal than the sars and mers older patients with comorbidities tend to experience more severe symptoms making them more vulnerable the majority of sars-cov-2 infected patients displayed mild symptoms and generally have a good prognosis classified as mild covid-19 9 13  however a large proportion of patients especially among older men with underlying chronic diseases have rapidly progressed to severe covid-19 and suffered from respiratory distress requiring emergent medical interventions 14  unfortunately there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials supporting vaccines or efficient treatment for covid-19 4 5  additionally recent studies have shown the important roles of host immune responses in protection and the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections for instance sars-cov mers-cov and influenza a viruses 15 16  liao et al 17 reported that increased immune cell recruitment in covid-19 patients suggested a crucial role of cd8  t cells in successful viral control and proposed support therapeutic strategies that target the myeloid cell compartment to treat covid-19-associated inflammation however little is known about drug screens of disease-relevant cell types drug repurposing is an essential and universal strategy in the development of new drugs 18  it may facilitate the discovery of new mechanisms of action for existing drugs which is less time-consuming and cost-effective let alone the existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution 19 20  considering that an rna virus exhibits a considerable degree of sequence variation drugs targeting host factors may cause less mutational resistance with more effective and broad anti-virus spectrum potential hence there is an urgent need to identify potential therapeutics with new strategies for emerging infectious diseases and repurposing clinically assessed drugs represents one of the most practicable strategies for the rapid identification of treatments to combat covid-19 in this study we analyzed a publicly available single-cell rna sequencing

pd-158780 and nvp-auy922 for example the glycogen synthase kinase inhibitor sb-216763 acts as neuroprotectant 42 and prevents cardiac ischemia 43  jte-907 is a cannabinoid receptor inverse agonist producing anti-inflammatory effects 44  to further demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy we have accomplished the identification of therapeutic drugs by transcriptional changes in balf of covid-19 patients with a bulk rna-seq data 26  ten efficient candidates were identified using the same analysis pipeline two of which including glycogen synthase kinase inhibitor sb-216763 and ppar receptor antagonist gw-6471 were also included in the single-cell-based candidate lists supplemental table s12  further investigations are necessary to characterize the adrs which are a central consideration during drug development 45  therefore we conducted a computational approach using the sep-l1000 database to predictive relationships between drugs and the emergence of adrs supplemental tables s13 s14 figure 4 shows a heatmap of the top 50 drug-adr association for on-label  figure 4a  and off-label  figure 4b  adrs these findings highlighted drug-adr associations and may lead to inform clinical decisions regarding treatments for covid-19 covid-19 has spread rapidly and no proven vaccine or drug has yet been identified to treat it generally speaking there are several ways to control or prevent emerging coronavirus disease including antivirals small-molecule drugs biologics and vaccines 4 5  due to the lack of effective therapeutic agents and long development cycles of vaccines it is therefore reasonable to consider repurposing existing drugs and compounds for covid-19 drug repurposing is a potentially important strategy for the discovery of existing medicines to tackle covid-19 18  gordon et al 46 identified 332 high-confidence sars-cov-2human protein-protein interactions for drug repurposing an additional study 47 tested the antiviral activity of 20 fda approved drugs against sars-cov-2 that previously shown to inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov another research team 48 conducted a high-throughput analysis of the reframe library to identify 30 candidates existing drugs that prevent the covid-19 virus from replicating in mammalian cells in a study 49 based on public data of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and the database lincs several drugs were identified on covd-19 targets ace2 host immune responses are particularly important in the protection and pathogenesis of the respiratory viral infections like sars-cov mers-cov and influenza a viruses 15 16  liao et al 17 observed that t and nk cells accumulated epithelial cells decreased in covid-19 patients compared to controls meanwhile macrophages dysregulated and the cell compartments differed in mild and severe disease courses more t and nk cells decreased in severe cases but cd8  t cells increased in mild cases however drug screening of disease-relevant cell types is still unclear here we analyzed publicly available data of covid-19 patients and performed data mining by using the lincs l1000 database to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease and sep-l1000 database to predict side effects our approach is different from previous methods for drug repurposing for coronavirus since it does not merely rapidly identify likely effective therapeutic agents in preventing or treating covid-19 but tries to filter out specific medications during the patients disease courses furthermore the data and transcriptome are derived from human samples from real patients two independent sets of experiments lastly we explore the underlying risk factors associated with some side effects of the candidates overall our data will guide the future development of therapies for the different durations of covid-19 and other viral respiratory infections this study has several limitations to note first the public scrna-seq data had a small number of clinical samples n9 without available patient information which makes comparisons between studies difficult with the fast pace and expected large number of published literature using other patient samples our candidate lists may need to be revised second our findings may not apply to children because all the sequencing data were from adults future work on large-scale data mining would help us in better identification of antiviral drugs the pandemic of covid-19 represents the greatest global public health crisis in this generation so far no proven vaccines and therapies have been identified based on the study we thoroughly investigated potential candidates for the treatment in covid-19 progression and predicted some possible adverse effects the findings can guide additional repurposing studies

an emerging infectious disease middle east respiratory syndrome mers caused by mers coronavirus mers-cov was first identified in 2012 in saudi arabia 1 and has since spread to other countries including the united states as of july 14 2014 there have been 834 laboratory-confirmed cases including 288 deaths httpwwwwhointcsrdon20140714mersen raising serious concerns over its pandemic potential 2 3 with bats and dromedary camels as its likely natural reservoir and intermediate transmission host respectively 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 mers-cov poses a long-term threat to human health 12 13 thus the need for the development of effective prophylactic strategies such as vaccines to control the further spread of mers-cov is urgent the spike s protein of mers-cov plays important roles in mediating viral entry to host cells 14 as the first step of cell entry a defined receptor-binding domain rbd in the spike proteins binds to its functional receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 on the host cell surface for viral attachment 15 several versions of mers-cov rbd fragments have been identified by different groups these rbd fragments encompass spike residues 358-588 367-588 377-588 and 367-606 respectively 16 17 18 19 20 extensive studies have found that the spike rbd of sars coronavirus sars-cov which caused the sars epidemic in 20022003 21 22 is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding domain and an attractive subunit vaccine candidate against sars-cov infection 23 24 25 26 27 28 it is likely that the mers-cov rbd could also serve as a subunit vaccine candidate against mers-cov infection indeed it was previously shown that some of these mers-cov rbd fragments are immunogenic in animals resulting in neutralizing antibody responses 17 18 however it is not clear which one of these rbd fragments represents an ideal vaccine candidate and what is the mechanism behind the potential differences in the neutralizing abilities of these rbd fragments in this study we have expressed each of these mers-cov rbd fragments that were fused with fc fragment of human igg and investigated their receptor binding affinity antigenicity immunogenicity and neutralizing potential we have found the rbd fragment with the most neutralizing potential and explained the mechanism behind it overall this study has identified an ideal vaccine candidate for controlling mers-cov infections and enhanced understanding of design strategies for vial subunit vaccines four- to six-week-old female balbc mice and four- to five-month-old female nzw rabbits were used in the study the animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health the animal protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments of the new york blood center permit number 19415 the construction expression and purification of recombinant mers-cov rbd fragments with fc of human igg were done as previously described with some modifications 18 29 briefly genes encoding residues 350-588 358-588 367-588 367-606 and 377-588 of mers-cov s protein were respectively amplified by pcr using codon-optimized mers-cov s sequences genbank afs889361 as template and inserted into the pfuse-higg1-fc2 expression vector hereinafter named fc invivogen san diego ca mers-cov s1 residues 18-725 plus a c-terminal his6 s1-his was amplified and inserted into pjw4303 expression vector jiangsu taizhou haiyuan protein biotech co ltd china the recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293t cells atcc manassas va changed into fresh serum-free dmem invitrogen carlsbad ca 8 h later and collected for supernatant containing expressed proteins 72 h post-transfection the recombinant proteins were purified by protein a affinity chromatography ge healthcare piscataway nj for proteins with fc or ni-nta superflow qiagen valencia ca for proteins with his tag according to the manufacturers instructions human dpp4 ectodomain residues 39-766 was expressed and purified as previously described 19 briefly recombinant human dpp4 ectodomain containing an n-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a c-terminal his6 was expressed in insect cells using the bac-to-bac expression system invitrogen secreted into cell culture medium and subsequently purified by ni-nta affinity column and superdex200 gel filtration column ge healthcare the purified mers-cov rbd fragments were analyzed by sds-page and western blot as previously described 29 30 briefly the boiled and nonboiled proteins were separated by 10 trisglycine sds-page gels followed by transferring to nitrocellulose membranes after blocking overnight at 4 c using 5 non-fat milk in pbst the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mers-cov s-specific polyclonal antibodies 11000 after three washes the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg 13000 invitrogen for 1 h at room temperature and the signals were visualized using ecl western blot substrate reagents and amersham hyperfilm ge healthcare the binding of mers-cov rbd fragments with dpp4 was performed by co-immunoprecipitation assay as previously described 18 briefly recombinant soluble dpp4 sdpp4 10 g or dpp4-expressing huh-7 cell lysates 5  107ml were respectively incubated with mers-cov rbd fragments 10 g plus protein a sepharose beads at 4 c for 1 h followed by washing with lysis buffer and pbs and boiling for 10 min the samples were subjected to sds-page and western blot analysis followed by detection using anti-dpp4 monoclonal antibody 1 gml rd systems minneapolis mn and mers-cov s1-specific polyclonal antibodies 11000 respectively mice were immunized with mers-cov rbd fragments following a previously described protocol 18 29 briefly mice were prime-vaccinated subcutaneously sc with 10 gmouse of recombinant mers-cov rbd fragments in the presence of montanide isa 51 adjuvant seppic fairfield nj and boosted twice with the same immunogen and adjuvant at 3-week 21 days intervals sera from 10 days post-last vaccination 52 days were heat-inactivated at 56 c for 30 min and detected for mers-cov s-specific antibody response and neutralizing antibodies sera from 0 10 31 and 136 days post-initial immunization of s377-588-fc were also tested for mers-cov s-specific antibody response the rabbit immunization covance research products inc denver pa followed a protocol similar to that of mice with some modifications briefly rabbits were prime-vaccinated with mers-cov s377-588-fc fragment 250 grabbit plus freunds complete adjuvant and then boosted twice at 3-week intervals with the same immunogen 125 grabbit plus freunds incomplete adjuvant sera were collected and tested as above elisa was carried out to test the binding of mers-cov rbd fragments to sdpp4 as previously described 18 briefly 96-well elisa plates were precoated with sdpp4 4 gml overnight at 4 c and blocked with 2 non-fat milk at 37 c for 2 h diluted mers-cov rbd fragments were added to the plates and incubated at 37 c for 1 h followed by four washes bound antibodies were incubated with hrp-conjugated anti-human igg 13000 invitrogen at 37 c for 1 h the reaction was visualized by substrate 3355-tetramethylbenzidine tmb invitrogen and stopped by 1 n h2so4 the absorbance at 450 nm a450 was measured by elisa plate reader tecan san jose ca the detection of mers-cov s-specific antibody responses in collected mouse sera was performed following a protocol similar to that described above except for replacing the coating antigen with mers-cov s1-his protein 1 gml the primary antibody with serially diluted mouse sera and the secondary antibody with anti-mouse igg-hrp 13000 invitrogen 31 the standard micro-neutralization assay was used to quantify the neutralizing potential of each of the rbd fragments as previously described 18 31 32 briefly serum samples were diluted at serial 2-fold in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 infectious mers-covemc-2012well before transferring to duplicate wells of vero e6 cells grown in 96-well tissue culture plates after 72 h of incubation when the virus control wells exhibited advanced virus-induced cytopathic effect cpe the neutralizing capacity of individual serum samples was assessed by determining the presence or absence of cpe neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely inhibited virus-induced cpe in at least 50 of the wells nt50 values are presented as mean with standard deviation sd statistical significance among different vaccination groups was calculated by students t-test using stata statistical software p values less than 005 were considered statistically significant five human igg fc-fused fragments representing the defined rbd residues 358-588 367-588 367-606 and 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein and the rbd residues 350-588 control were constructed expressed and subjected to antigenicity measurement using the procedures as previously described fig 1b 18 all five rbd fragments were expressed at high levels from culture supernatants of transfected 293 t cells and purified to high homogeneity the c-terminal fc tag strongly promoted formation of rbd dimers as evidenced by the almost twice of the molecular weight of non-denatured versus denatured proteins fig 1c top these recombinant rbd fragments reacted strongly with polyclonal antibodies specifically raised in mice against recombinant s1 protein of mers-cov fig 1c bottom suggesting that they are in their native and antigenic conformation two alternative assays co-immunoprecipitation and elisa were carried out to measure the receptor-binding activities of mers-cov rbd fragments results from co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that the five mers-cov rbd fragments were co-immunoprecipitated with recombinant sdpp4 protein two clear bands corresponding to the sizes of dpp4 and respective fc-fused mers-cov rbd fragments were readily revealed with anti-dpp4- and anti-mers-cov s1-specific antibodies whereas a single band with a molecular weight corresponding to dpp4 was detected in the sample containing only sdpp4 fig 2a left in addition each of the five mers-cov rbd fragments co-immunoprecipitated cell-associated dpp4 anchored on huh-7 cells in which target proteins with anticipated sizes were identified using anti-dpp4- and anti-mers-cov s1-specific antibodies respectively fig 2a right thus co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that all of the five rbd fragments specifically interact with mers-covs receptor dpp4 elisa was then performed by adding mers-cov rbd fragments to the plates coated with a fixed amount of sdpp4 followed by identification of the binding affinity based on the od values at 450 nm while all of the tested mers-cov rbds were capable of binding to sdpp4 we noted the existence of their differential binding capacity as shown in fig 2b among the five rbd fragments s358-588-fc s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc possessed significantly higher dpp4-binding affinity than s350-588-fc and s367-606-fc at concentrations of 50 and 125 gml respectively as expected the control higg-fc protein did not show any specific binding to sdpp4 fig 2b therefore the extended n- or c-terminus of mers-cov rbd fragments appears to have negative effect on the receptor-binding activity to evaluate the immunogenicity of the five mers-cov rbd fragments we immunized mice with each of the rbd fragments according to the dosing strategy described in materials and methods and detected specific responses of total igg antibody along with igg1 and igg2a subtypes in serum specimens of immunized mice elisa results showed that all five rbd fragments were immunogenic in mice and induced production of igg antibodies that specifically bind to mers-cov s1 protein without the fusion of fc particularly sera from mice immunized with s367-588-fc or s377-588-fc acquired a stronger binding to mers-cov s1 protein than those immunized with the other three rbd fragments whereas the control samples from pbs-immunized mice revealed negligible binding activity fig 3a confirming the specificity of such igg antibody response elicited by these rbd fragments in addition the endpoint titration of igg antibody response revealed that s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc were more immunogenic than s350-588-fc s358-588-fc or s367-606-fc in eliciting mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies in mice after 3 vaccinations fig 3b thus the extended n- or c-terminus of the mers-cov rbd also reduces the immunogenicity of the rbd fragments observation of igg subtypes revealed that s350-588-fc s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc were capable of inducing a significantly higher level of igg1 th2 antibody response than s367-606-fc while s350-588-fc and s367-588-fc elicited igg1 antibody significantly higher than s358-588-fc fig 3c in addition s350-588-fc s358-588-fc s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc promoted a significantly higher level of igg2a th1 antibody response than s367-606-fc whereas the igg2a antibodies induced by s367-588-fc were also significantly higher than those induced by s350-588-fc s358-588-fc and s377-588-fc respectively fig 3d the above results suggest that s377-588-fc is among the rbd fragments that induced high titers of th1 and th2 antibody response neutralizing potentials of the five rbd fragments were initially evaluated in immunized mice results from vero e6-based micro-neutralization showed that each of the five rbd fragments was capable of inducing neutralization antibodies among them s377-588-fc induced the highest level of neutralizing antibody response on the 10th day after the third immunization fig 4a as expected sera from pbs-immunized mice did not show neutralizing activity thus s377-588-fc has the highest neutralizing potential among the five rbd fragments furthermore s377-588-fc was used to immunize rabbits to confirm its neutralizing potential in different animal species vero e6-based micro-neutralization assay demonstrated that on the 10th day after the third immunization with s377-588-fc high titers of neutralizing antibody responses were generated in rabbits fig 4b therefore s377-588-fc the shortest among the five rbd fragments can produce high-titer neutralizing antibody responses in both mice and rabbits suggesting that the fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding domain to elucidate the potential of s377-588-fc as a vaccine candidate we immunized mice with this protein for a period of 136 days and observed the kinetics of antibody responses as expected increasing titers of igg antibodies were found in mouse sera after initial immunization and reached the highest titers during 31 and 52 days post-immunization the antibody titers decreased slightly afterwards but still maintained at relative high levels fig 4c these data demonstrated that the fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein is able to induce and maintain rbd-specific immune responses in the vaccinated animals for at least four months confirming its good potential to be further developed as a subunit mers vaccine the increasing number of mers cases indicates urgency for the development of effective vaccines against mers-cov infection and disease among all of the mers-cov structural proteins the spike protein particularly its rbd is an important target for such an effort due to its proven ability to elicit potent neutralizing antibody response in immunized laboratory animals 33 indeed recombinant rbd fragments containing residues 358-588 and 377-662 of mers-cov s have been shown to induce neutralizing antibody response in immunized rabbits and mice respectively 17 29 moreover a modified vaccinia virus ankara mva expressing the full-length s protein of mers-cov was also proven effective in vaccinated mice to produce potent neutralizing antibodies and restricted mers-cov infection in vivo
34 in addition to the aforementioned recombinant proteins and viral vectors nanoparticles and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles vrps-expressing spike protein of mers-cov have also shown great potentials as mers vaccines 35 36 in this study we expressed five different versions of mers-cov rbd fragments based on the previously published studies 16 17 18 19 and further investigated and compared their receptor binding ability antigenicity immunogenicity and neutralizing potential the fc of human igg was fused to these rbd fragments because the fc tag can enhance the expression purification and immunogenicity of viral rbd proteins 37 38 39 40 41 42 our results show that the abilities of these rbd fragments to induce immune responses and neutralizing antibodies differ significantly among these rbd fragments s377-588-fc demonstrated high receptor-binding affinity induced high titer igg antibody in mice elicited the highest titer neutralizing antibodies in mice and also induced high titer neutralizing antibodies in rabbits crystal structure of mers-cov rbd reveals that rbd fragment encompassing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein has a stably folded structure with ordered residues on the n- and c-termini it contains the receptor-binding motif rbm residues 484-567 fig 5
 and almost all of the major neutralizing epitopes identified in mers-cov rbd many of which are specifically recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies nabs 31 43 44 45 these epitopes are clustered on a protruding ridge in the rbm region of the rbd and overlap with the dpp4-binding site fig 5 16 19 20 although not yet experimentally confirmed other regions in the rbm that overlap with the dpp4-binding site may also contain neutralizing epitopes on the other hand the regions in the mers-cov spike that do not overlap with the dpp4-binding site likely contain non-neutralizing epitopes these non-neutralizing epitopes might hinder the production of neutralizing antibodies and may also induce harmful immune responses 46 47 48 the regions in the rbd core structures contribute to the folding and the stability of the whole rbd and thus they are essential however the regions flanking the rbd do not contribute to protein folding or receptor binding therefore it is necessary to identify the critical neutralizing epitopes in rbd in the mers-cov spike protein and exclude non-neutralizing epitopes without the expense of domain integrity and stability as a means of immunofocusing for vaccine development it is important to further test the immune efficacy of s377-588-fc in an animal model challenged by mers-cov non-human primates such as rhesus macaques can be infected by mers-cov showing clinical signs of the disease and histopathological changes in lungs 49 50 however the high cost of purchasing and maintaining the monkeys and performing the experiments in absl-3 facility have prevented us from using this animal model small animals such as mice syrian hamsters and ferrets that can be infected by sars-cov are unsusceptible to mers-cov infection 51 52 53 54 although mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing human dpp4 can be infected by mers-cov they did not show significant clinical symptoms of mers 55 therefore the in vivo efficacy of this mers-cov rbd-based vaccine candidate will be evaluated in a more sophisticated small animal model once it becomes available overall the rbd fragment encompassing residues 377-588 of mers-cov s protein is the ideal subunit vaccine candidate with the capability of inducing strong neutralizing antibodies in different species of animals therefore it can be the focus of future development of mers vaccines furthermore this study suggests that in vaccine design it maybe helpful to eliminate non-neutralizing epitopes from the rbd fragments to keep the rbd fragments in their most physiological relevant conformation and also allow the host immune responses to focus on the neutralizing epitopes the authors declared no conflict of interest  current global vaccine and drug efforts against covid-19 pros and cons of bypassing animal trials bijayeeta deb hemal shah suchi goel   the recent pandemic of novel coronavirus has already affected thousands of people and is continuing to spread around the world this virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease caused is called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of 5 may 2020 a total of 3517345 confirmed clinical episodes of covid-19 and 243401 deaths have been reported worldwide who 2020a most sars-cov-2-infected people experience mild to moderate respiratory distress and generally recover without requiring any special treatment however older people generally 60 years of age and those with underlying medical complications like diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious symptoms like acute respiratory disease and multiorgan failure ultimately leading to death lai et al2020 sars-cov-2 belongs to the same family as that of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle east respiratory syndrome viruses that were responsible for epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively lu et al2020 the genomes of sars-cov-2 is a single positive-strand rna and codes for similar structural protein as of sars giving rise to a debate about whether it is a laboratory engineered sars virus or a naturally evolved new virus the sequence analysis of its rna made available by china in the public database showed that it is a novel virus that originated possibly from bats through natural evolution andersen et al2020 however how it got transmitted from bats to humans with such high transmission rates from humans to humans is still ambiguous for infection into human cells the receptor-binding domain of spike protein s present on the envelope of the virus binds to ace2 protein present on human cells initiating the entry process this binding induces large conformational change in s protein that leads to exposure of its proteolytic site the proteolytic site is then cleaved by a protease causing the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane completing the entry of the virus into a human cell further it is shown that the s protein of sars-cov-2 has a higher binding affinity with ace2 as compared to sars wrapp et al2020 based on these results it could be concluded that sars-cov-2 is a variant of sars however the sars-cov-2 genome has additional features like the presence of a polybasic rrar cleavage site at the junction of s1 and s2 subunits of the spike protein the presence of a polybasic cleavage site helps in effective cleavage by furin and proteases and determines viral infectivity and host range andersen et al 2020 interestingly in case of the avian influenza virus the gain of this polybasic site in ha that performs a similar function of host receptor binding like spike protein can transform the virus from low virulent to high virulent forms along with this the acquisition of cleavage site is positively selected for fast replication and transmission rates alexander and brown 2009 to better understand the transmission rates the growth rate r0 that defines the natural transmission of a pathogen needs to be calculated for sars mers and sars-cov-2 it is interesting to observe that although they belong to the same family sars-cov-2 has twice the transmission rate when compared to sars along with this the multiplication cycles range is 510 days for sars and mers and 23 days for sars-cov-2 liang 2020 probably this the reason why sars and mers were far more contained whereas covid-19 is highly widespread the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 during the early outbreak in wuhan china was calculated as 14 wu et al2020 however in late february who estimated this rate to increase to 58 on the other hand south korea registered a death rate of 1 or less while the death rate in italy seems to be for now several folds higher rosenbaum 2020 the infection has advanced to more than 210 countries and territories with an average mortality rate of 34 according to recent reports rajgor et al2020 therefore therapeutic and vaccine initiatives in this direction are inevitable efforts have been made in drug therapy as well as vaccine development to combat covid-19 till date the us food and drug administration fda has approved an antiviral drug remsdesivir developed by gilead inc usa and an antimalarial drug chloroquine cqhydroxychloroquine hcq for the treatment of covid-19 an array of drugs approved for other diseases are also considered potentially useful while several investigational drugs are under study in several clinical trials conducted across the globe table 1a and b figure 1 in order to clinically manage coronavirus researchers from china france and a team of doctors from rajasthan india have started using antiviral drugs in combination with chloroquine colson et al2020 lai et al2020 liu et al2020 recently who announced a global trial called solidarity to investigate whether this dangerous respiratory disease could be treated with the available therapeutic aids httpsnewsunorgenstory2020031059722 it is however an unprecedented effort that includes thousands of patients across many countries to volunteer for the clinical trials the trials aim to test the effectiveness of the four potential candidates 1 the antiviral drug remdesivir that is known to inhibit rna dependent rna polymerase 2 a combination of two hiv drugs lopinavir and ritonavir 3 lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon beta and 4 the antimalarial drugs chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine table 1b coronavirus being a rna virus retroviral drugs could possibly have an effect on treatment however cqhcq which was successful as an antimalarial is currently being considered as a part of treatment strategy against covid-19 colson et al2020 cq has also been shown to possess anti-hiv activity through post-transcriptional inhibition of gp120 present on the viral envelope or inhibition of tat-mediated transactivation jiang et al1996 savarino et al2001 moreover chloroquine can also increase the ph of endosomes mauthe et al2018 since coronavirus do not encode for gp120 or tat protein and low ph is essential for uncoating of the virus inside the host cell it is more likely that chloroquine stops viral spread by blocking the process of uncoating and release of nucleic acid however the current data from various small and non-randomized trials show only limited effects of cqhcq or hcq-azithromycin combination on treatment for covid-19 since cqhcq is known to cause toxic effects and unprescribed use has led to human deaths large-scale randomized trials like the solidarity project will be able to convincingly prove the effectiveness of cqhcq as a drug against covid-19 recently it has been shown that combination of lopinavir-ritonavir causes adverse effects on covid-19-infected adults and no benefits are observed cao et al2020 therefore drugs should be used with caution until their mechanisms are well understood and their efficacy is well established it is also known with viruses that mutate at high frequencies give rise to different strains thereby easily gaining resistance to drugs thus in-depth analysis in animal models is required to study their mechanism of action and the ability of the virus to gain resistance against these drugs
further animal testing will also be important to measure absorbance of the drug in the body its dissociation chemistry its metabolomics and the mechanism of drug clearance in principle drugs only help in the treatment of humans once they contract the disease but for long-term protection against the disease vaccines have to be developed to avoid such a global pandemic vaccines will be able to mount an immune response against the virus by generating neutralizing antibodies that would protect humans when again infected with sars-cov-2 and thus avoid another outbreak of such a virulent virus as the key 12 amino acid residues present in ace2 of humans are conserved in ace2 of macaques as well melin et al2020 macaques are a closer model system to humans and hence the choice for animal studies for vaccine testing of covid-19 the studies with macaques have shown that they do get infected with pulmonary infiltrates as observed in radiographs with high viral loads in swabs of nose and throat and shedding in the upper and lower respiratory tract munster et al2020 rockx et al2020 taken together the disease symptoms in rhesus macaques matches with the milder symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection in humans further serum analysis demonstrate an increase in chemokine levels of il1ra il10 il15 mcp-1 il6 and decrease in tgf levels on days 1 and 3 post-infection but with no statistical significance munster et al2020 sars-cov-2 is known to affect older people as compared to young ones similarly it is also observed in macaques that older ones show higher viral loads in nose and throat along with prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of old animals rockx et al 2020 thus rhesus macaques can be a promising animal model for challenge studies and studying the efficacy of vaccines as immune responses in monkeys are similar to humans this will further allow us to understand how monkeys challenge coronavirus and protect themselves ferrets are model organisms for influenza virus and have similar lung morphology as humans and can actually cough and sneeze supporting their use as an animal model for sars-cov-2 cameron et al2012 enkirch and von messling 2015 a team of virologists led by ss vasan from australia has already shown that these animals are susceptible to coronavirus callaway 2020 but the virus only causes an increase in body temperature and other symptoms that are the hallmark for sars-cov-2 do not develop and the virus cannot replicate to high levels but interestingly the infected ferrets can spread the virus with high transmission rates even to adjacent cages through direct contact or aerosols kim et al2020 since most of the countries are now under community transmission stage ferrets will act as a valuable animal model to study the transmission of the sars-cov-2 compared with the logistics cost and ethical regulations in using monkeys and ferrets laboratory-bred mice always remain a convenient choice as a disease model however coronavirus do not infect mice and rats as 11 of the 29 amino acids in mice and 13 of 29 amino acids in rats differ in the binding region of ace2 compared to humans chan et al2020 in order to solve this problem perlman laboratory developed humanized mouse models for sars where they incorporated human ace2 in mice mccray et al2007 the humanized ace2 mice are successfully infected by sars and develop lethal brain disease making it an obvious choice to test infection with sars-cov-2 as well however due to lack of funding and high cost of maintenance of this mice colony they discontinued breeding of mice in their facility and submitted the sperms of hace2 mice to jackson laboratory but these mice are now high in demand and jackson laboratory is facing a huge pressure to meet these demands however recent results from china have shown that hace2 mice do support sars-cov-2 infection where they reduce weight by 20 and virus replication occur in lungs moreover infected hace2 mice also suffer from interstitial pneumonia where bronchioles are filled with periodic acid schiff pas positive exudation or detached bronchial epithelium but are unable to transmit the disease also the infiltrates are enriched in macrophages t-lymphocytes and b-lymphocytes the authors also confirmed that the mice use hace2 for entry and fulfill kochs postulates indicating that these mice are successful disease model for sars-cov-2 bao et al2020 these animals support sars infection and show maximum similarity to human ace2 where only 4 amino acids out of 29 are different in the critical binding region of ace2 making them a testable model for sars-cov-2 infection upon infection of sars-cov-2 syrian hamsters demonstrate weight loss by 11 along with high viral load in nasal turbinate lungs and trachea further the lethality rate in hamsters is 5 and exudative inflammation with hemorrhage and necrosis of alveolae damage is visible during the initial infection period the inflammation of intestinal mucosal epithelium that is the causative agent of diarrohea along with myocardial degeneration is consistent with the pathogenesis observed in humans importantly syrian hamsters show similar immune responses as that of humans where ifn- and pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced at day 2 post-infection followed by the decrease of type ii interferon and il6 and increase of tgf- at day 7 post-infection for an animal to be successful as a model system and perform challenge studies is also dependent on its ability to transmit the pathogen consistent with this syrian hamsters are able to transmit the disease to nave hamsters upon challenge with sars-cov-2 chan et al2020 taken all the data together as syrian hamsters show pathogenesis immune responses similar to humans and are capable of transmission this strengthens their use as one of the most testable models for vaccine studies thus there are many promising animal models for testing the vaccine candidates for sars-cov-2 but still extensive studies are required to confirm their efficiency as an appropriate model for covid-19 in order to fight coronavirus infection and win the race against time moderna a biotechnological company in collaboration with national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid usa has already begun phase i clinical trial with experimental vaccine mrna-1273 rna vaccine testing begins 2020 who 2020b their argument for directly going for phase i clinical trial is that the mrna-1273 raised a good antibody response after immunization in mice and a lack of disease model for coronavirus cansino biologics from china has also developed a replication-defective adenovirus expressing spike protein of sars-cov-2 as a vaccine candidate for covid-19 who 2020b beijing institute of biological productswuhan institute of biological products and sinovac are using inactivated method while inovio pharmaceuticals is using a dna-based vaccine approach similarly in order to fast-track vaccine development all of them have skipped animal trials and are currently performing phase i trials the phase i clinical trials will test the safety and toxicity of their vaccine target in humans and in a way help in protecting humans from sars-cov-2 although this looks promising for fast-tracking vaccine development there is division among the scientific community about bypassing animal models before phase i clinical trials in addition agencies like peta are against using animals for research purposes the question remains can vaccine research do without an animal model in the history of mankind it has been clear that viral pandemics have been common in affecting millions of people the problem is due to its ability to multiply inside the host and produce high numbers by infecting a single cell accompanied by its stability in non-living surfaces which allows them to spread very fast that is why virus pandemics are global with high transmission rates thus to control viruses extreme steps are often needed therefore in the absence of disease model backed by their antibody responses in mice niaid and cansino biologics moved ahead with phase i clinical trials after bypassing animal model studies for vaccines different biotechnological companies are looking forward to come up with a vaccine in around a year to a year and a half thus the decision by the fda to bypass animal trials is taken positively by entrepreneurs according to them flexibility of laws by the fda could avoid delays in treating as observed in the case of ganciclovir although ganciclovir is successful in treating patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related cytomegalovirus retinitis due to lack of animal studies it did not get approval by fda and was delayed by 4 years van norman 2019 besides overcoming the time frame in which a vaccine can enter the market it is also important to note that results from animal studies may not translate to humans both in terms of toxicity and challenge studies isuprel a treatment for asthma was rendered safe in rats guinea pigs dogs and monkeys but still led to deaths in humans with far less dosages in great britain in another instance to treat human autoimmune disease a monoclonal antibody tgn1412 after going through animal models was processed for phase i trials the introduction of tgn1412 led to critical illness within minutes along with long-term complications in phase i volunteers van norman 2019 however tgn1412 is now restored for rheumatoid arthritis after developing better assays for studying immune responses and lowering the dosage of this monoclonal antibody brown 2018 further strengthening the fact that studies with animals may not always translate to use in humans in contrast chemicals that are generally toxic in animal studies may be safe in humans penicillin fatal to guinea pigs would have failed animal studies but due to lack of regulations to perform animal studies at that time it came into use and is presently a successful drug similarly aspirin is toxic to rhesus monkeys and paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats van norman 2019 thus these studies indicate that animal studies do not predict the outcomes to humans although they share a lot of genomic similarities the final response to disease will also depend on the epigenome and environmental differences even with the transgenic humanized models that mimic the human system we must remember that often genes do not work alone in such complex higher-order organisms although bypassing animal models can save time effort and money but it is not possible to perform safety and challenge studies for a disease in humans also animal studies provide the foundation to study disease further it is difficult to study the progression of disease in humans but it is easy in an animal model as they can be sacrificed for histopathology in order to follow the course of infection although cell lines can also be used to study the infection process animal models provide the advantage of studying the viral multiplication with respect to symptoms and physiology of an organism thus it becomes really important for a newly originated coronavirus to be studied in an animal model further studying animal models will also provide detailed information about the potential reservoirs of sars-cov-2 in an organism another problem faced by vaccine efforts against viral diseases especially viruses having rna as the genetic material is that repair mechanisms do not work on rna and thus lot of mutations are accumulated in their rna this phenomenon is known as antigenic drift and is the reason that influenza shots are needed before every seasonal flu infection thus sars-cov-2-possessing rna genome is also prone to antigenic drift hence animal models of coronavirus will help in understanding the selection pressure and antigenic drift and evolution of the virus once a vaccine is administered one of the major disadvantages of bypassing animal models is that it has been observed in case of viral infections that sometimes the administration of vaccines enhances the susceptibility of the subject to the disease this phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement or antigen sin and is common for vaccine candidates of hivaids virus and dengue virus once the subject is immunized with the antigen it mounts an immune response against the antigen but when the vaccinated individual is infected again with the virus having a different serotype the pre-existing antibodies are not able to neutralize the virus the formation of antibodyvirus complex helps in attachment to fc receptor on circulating monocytes resulting in the efficient infection of monocytes by the virus halstead 2002 thus instead of protecting the subject it leads to higher complications and death of the subject in case of infection by the pathogen huisman et al2009 therefore the biotech companies that have bypassed animal models should note that antibody-dependent enhancement is also observed with feline coronavirus fcov the immunization of mice with spike s protein of this virus mounts an overall high antibody response but neutralizing antibody levels are low however challenge of these cats results in enhanced susceptibility to infection along with death of cats huisman et al2009 this phenomenon is especially relevant to proteins that are prone to antigenic drift such as the s protein and sars and mers known to be capable of this phenomena liu et al2019 houser et al2017 as s protein is the major vaccine target of sars-cov-2 studies in animal model are really required before establishing it as a vaccine candidate in this global emergency the entire scientific community is attempting effective treatment and prevention of the disease to shorten the time and for the larger interest of humanity some routine yet essetial processes like animal trials are bypassed in the process of development of vaccine and drug development while options like drug repurposing are already adapted with varying degrees of success effective and targeted drugs and vaccines for the sars-cov-2 infection are still awaited moreover agencies like who and fda have already given a green signal for clinical trials of vaccines bypassing the regular process of animal trials hence it is important to access the positive and negative effects of the same choosing a suitable animal model is one of the main concerns for animal testing as the animal should mimic the response and effects to be generated after introduction of the drugvaccine to humans importantly some animal models such as the rhesus macaque ferrets mice and syrian hamster are proving to be successful for challenge by the sars-cov-2 with one or other similar symptoms as humans however a successful animal trial is not the only indicator of the success of any drugvaccine due to physiological barriers hence the decision of bypassing the animal model needs to be taken with utmost caution further saving time should not cost a large number of human lives as a failure of the drugvaccine could have devastating consequences  original article miyssa abdelmageed i abdelrahman abdelmoneim h mujahed mustafa i nafisa elfadol m naseem murshed s shaza shantier w abdelrafie makhawi m  background new endemic disease has been spread across wuhan city china on december 2019 within few weeks the world health organization who announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019  in late january 2020 who declared the outbreak of a public-health emergency of international concern due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide currently there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against covid-19 using immunoinformatics approach method several techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the t cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-ncov as a target results extensive mutations insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in covid-19 strain additionally ten peptides binding to mhc class i and mhc class ii were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 885 and 9999 respectively conclusion t cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for covid-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target nevertheless the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks  however covid-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at 2019-ncov receptor-binding motif particularly gln493 which provide advantageous interactions with human ace2 15  this difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses at present there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans but chinese traditional medicine such shufengjiedu capsules and lianhuaqingwen capsule could be possible treatments for covid-19 however there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy for these drugs 22  the main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself although traditional vaccines which depend on biochemical trials induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized animals but they can be costly allergenic time consuming and require in vitro culture of pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety 23 24 thus the need for safe and efficacious vaccines is highly recommended peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses 25 26  the core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized b-cell and t-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses b-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked with a t-cell epitope to make it immunogenic the t-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments 8-20 amino acids whereas the b-cell epitopes can be proteins 27 28  therefore in this study we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict epitopes from corona envelope e protein using immunoinformatics analysis 29 30 31 32 33 34  while rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection workflow summarizing the procedures for the epitope-based peptide vaccine prediction is shown in fig 1 figure 1 descriptive

preprint designing of a novel vaccine is very crucial to defending the rapid endless of global burden of disease 56 57 58 59  in the last few decades biotechnology has advanced rapidly alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccines design 60  peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for b and t cells 61 applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands 62 63 64  this approach has been used frequently in saint louis encephalitis virus 65  dengue virus 66  chikungunya virus 67 proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines the covid-19 is an rna virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the dna viruses 68  these mutations lied on the surface of the protein which make covid-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot 69  in our present work different peptides were proposed for the designing of vaccine against covid-19 fig 1  in the beginning the whole genome of covid-19 was analyzed by comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target 70  artemis comparative tool act was used to analyze human coronavirus hcov-hku1 reference sequence vs wuhan-hu-1 covid-19 results obtained fig2 revealed extensive mutation among the tested genomes new genes orf8 and orf6 were found inserted in covid-19 which were absent in hcov-hku1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission 71  high rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp to the end of the sequence this region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are envelope e protein nucleocapsid n protein membrane m protein and spike s protein all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus 72 73  these conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment between mers-cov and bat-coronavirus 74 and analyzed in sars-cov 75  the four proteins were then analyzed by vaxigen software to test the probability of antigenic proteins protein e was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as shown in table 1  literature survey confirmed this result in which protein e was investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and more recently middle-east respiratory 1 8 syndrome mers 72  furthermore the conservation of this protein against the seven strains was tested and confirmed through the use of bioedit package tool fig 3  as phylogenetic analysis is very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship between strains multiple sequence alignment msa was performed using clustalw for the seven strains of coronavirus which are covid-19nc04551 sars-cov fj211859 mesa-cov nc019843 hcov-hku1 ay884001 hcov-oc43 kf923903 hcov-nl63 nc005831 and hcov-229e ky983587 the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree revealed that covid-19 is found in the same clade of sars-cov thus the two strains are highly related to each other fig 4  the immune response of t cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to b cell where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response 76  vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen moreover the cd8 t and cd4 t cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity 77  thus designing vaccine against t cell is much more important choosing protein e as the antigenic site the binding affinity to mhc molecules was then evaluated the protein reference sequence was submitted to iedb mhc predication tool 21 peptides were found to bind mhc class i with different affinities table 1  from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the

is identified as the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 the epicenter of the covid-19 coronavirus outbreak was the central chinese city of wuhan from where it spread globally on january 30 2020 the world health organization officially declared the covid-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern human to human transmission occurs through droplets contact and fomites people with covid-19 show symptoms of fever cough muscle aches headache and diarrhea the principal feature of the severe disease is acute onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates the virus genome has been sequenced that allowed the development of diagnostic tests and research into vaccines and therapeutics 12 a specific rt-pcr-based test has been developed that is in use for clinical diagnoses 3 the abundance of publications in the first three months of 2020 indicates the intensive scientific effort to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes for treating covid-19 4 more than 200 clinical trials are currently underway to test novel and repurposed compounds against sars-cov-2 56 certain drugs including hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and remdesivir are being tested in clinical trials 7 8 9 one small study reported that combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin reduced the detection of viral rna compared to control

several steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefits of the vaccine the sars-cov-2 consists of single positive-stranded rna and four structural proteins a spike glycoprotein s a membrane glycoprotein m an envelope protein e and a nucleocapsid protein n 20 to enter the host cells the virus uses a densely glycosylated spike protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor with high affinity 2122 structural and biochemical studies suggest that the rbd has an ultra-high binding affinity to the human ace2 receptor 23 few groups have designed subunit vaccines against sars-cov-2 however their workflow involved either use of single protein for vaccine design 2425 or used only ctl epitopes without considering the importance of b-cell or htl epitopes 26 some subunit-vaccines are also in preclinical trials 2728 here we focused on designing a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine against sars-cov-2 using 33 highly antigenic epitopes we believe that experimental evaluation may result in a novel and immunogenic vaccine that may confer protection against sars-cov-2 infection the protein sequences of sars-cov-2

molecular dynamics md simulation is an effective method to study the molecular interactions and dynamics of the tlr3-vaccine complex the complex structure of the tlr3-vaccine was initially optimized using schrdinger maestro schrdinger release 20164 maestro schrdinger new york and subsequently used as the starting structure for md simulations first hydrogen atoms were added to the complex which was then solvated in an octahedral box of a simple point charge spc water in the center at least 10 nm from the box edge the system was subsequently electrostatically neutralized by the addition of appropriate counter ions md simulation was carried out with gromacs 512 software package using the gromos96 54a7 force-field a standard md simulation protocol started with 50000 steps of energy minimization until no notable change of energy was observed followed by a heating step from 0 to 300 k in 200 ps canonical ensemble and 1000 ps at 300 k isobaric-isothermal ensemble by constant temperature equilibration during this parrinello-rahman barostat pressure coupling was used to avoid the impact of velocity as a final step of the simulation 40 ns production run was carried out at 300 k with periodic boundary conditions in the npt ensemble with modified berendsen temperature coupling and at a constant pressure of 1 atm further the lincs algorithm along with the particlemesh ewald method was used for the calculation of longrange electrostatic forces fourier grid spacing and coulomb radius were set at 016 and 14 nm respectively during the simulations the van der waals vdw interactions were limited to 14 nm and structures were saved at every 10 ps for structural and dynamic analysis the analysis from md simulation was performed as described earlier 30 briefly the backbone rmsd and root mean square fluctuation rmsf of the vaccine-tlr3 complex from the md simulation trajectory was analyzed using gmx rms and gmx rmsf utilities of gromacs respectively the radius of gyration which represents the compactness of the tlr3-vaccine complex was analyzed using the gmx gyrate tool of gromacs utilities hydrogen bonds were determined using the hydrogen bonds module of visual molecular dynamics vmd throughout the 40 ns duration the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions formed between tlr3 and the vaccine subunit were computed and visualized in molecular operating environment software several snapshots of the tlr3-vaccine complexes were extracted from the md simulations and various interactions formed among them were computed essential dynamics ed which represent the principal motion directions by a set of eigenvectors was performed from the md simulation trajectory of tlr3-vaccine complex in this analysis a variancecovariance matrix was constructed by calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues and their projection along the first two principal components was monitored by principal component analysis pca the eigenvalues associated with each of the eigenvectors of the tlr3-vaccine complex were used to calculate the percentage of variability java codon adaptation tool jcat httpwwwjcatde was used for codon optimization of the vaccine sequence to test high-level expression of the vaccine in e coli strain k12 nebcutter httpnc2nebcomnebcutter2 was used for the selection of restriction enzyme cleavage sites and the expression vector pet28a was selected in silico clone of the vaccine was designed using the snapgene 113 restriction cloning tool the amino acid sequence of the three sars-cov-2 proteins namely nucleocapsid protein membrane glycoprotein and surface spike glycoprotein were retrieved from the ncbi database table 1 these proteins are known to have a prominent role in host receptor recognition viral entry and pathogenicity the proteins with an antigenic score of greater than 08 table 1 were used further for the prediction of epitopes for subunit vaccine designing a schematic representation of the methodology for the construction of the subunit vaccine candidate is shown in fig 1
 helper t-lymphocytes are the key players of the adaptive immune response they are involved in the activation of b-cells and cytotoxic t cells for antibody production and killing infected target cells respectively all three proteins were subjected to the iedb mhc-ii epitope prediction module for htl prediction a total of six highest immunogenic epitopes of 15-mer were selected based on their percentile rank and ic50 values also all these epitopes showed positive scores on ifnepitope server output table 2
 b-cells are the main components of humoral immunity during the adaptive immune response that produces antibodies which recognize antigens therefore it was necessary to predict b-cell epitopes before vaccine designing abcpred was performed for predicting b-cell epitope and a total of 9 epitopes with top scores from the three proteins were considered for the vaccine table 3
 ctl epitopes are essential for inducing mhc-i cellular immune response by neutralizing virus-infected cells and damaged cells via releasing cytotoxic proteins like granzymes perforins etc the ctl epitopes were predicted for all selected proteins using the netctl 12 server here a2 a3 and b7 supertypes were considered for prediction as they cover at least 883 of the total ethnic population eighteen epitopes with a combined score of 075 were finally considered for the vaccine table 4
 all the selected htl ctl and b-cell epitopes were subjected to the toxinpred module to screen for their toxicity supplementary table 1 shows that all epitopes chosen for the vaccine were non-toxic a total of 6 htls 18 ctls and 9 b-cell epitopes derived from the three proteins were used to design the subunit vaccine 566 amino acid residues against sars-cov-2 supplementary fig 1 the human -defensin 168 amino acid residues sequence was added as an adjuvant followed by the htl ctl and b-cell epitopes and linked by specific linkers an important parameter of vaccine designing is ensuring that the constructed vaccine is immunogenic to induce a humoral andor cell-mediated immune response against the targeted virus the computational data suggest that our vaccine is antigenic with a probability score of 0513 and 0732 predicted by vaxijen v20 and antigenpro servers respectively the allergenicity score was found to be 0658 in algpred prediction module additionally the vaccine was also found to be non-allergic using allertop v20 the designed vaccine construct is composed of 566 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 6234 kda the theoretical pi was 1021 suggesting the vaccine is significantly basic the half-life of the vaccine was estimated to be 30 h in mammalian reticulocytes in vitro 20 h in yeast in vivo and 10 h in e coli in vivo suggesting that the construct is stable in vivo the instability index was estimated to be 2476 suggesting a stable protein the computed aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity were found to be 7779 and 0187 respectively suggesting that the vaccine is thermostable and hydrophilic respectively the secondary structure was predicted using the psipred 40 server supplementary fig 2 the tertiary structure of the vaccine was predicted using the trrosetta modeling suite the 3d model generated by trrosetta modeling was subjected to the procheck server where ramachandran plot statistics were generated the output showed 984 residues were present in the favored region 10 residues in the generously allowed region and 06 residues in disallowed regions further the z-score plot and energy plot was generated by the prosa web server the calculated z-score 846 lies within the x-ray crystal structure range the energy plot suggested that all the residues have low energy value in the modeled structure fig 2
 vaccine-receptor docking was performed to evaluate the binding energy of the vaccine with its tlr-3 receptor cluspro analysis provided 30 vaccine-receptor complexes with respective energy scores the lowest energy complex with a binding energy of about 1491 kj mol1 was selected and subjected to md simulation fig 3
 the binding modes dynamics and stability of the vaccine-tlr3 complex were evaluated using a 40 ns md simulation study fig 4
 the atomic-level interaction between vaccine and tlr3 was determined and root mean square deviation rmsd root mean square fluctuation rmsf radius of gyration rg hydrogen bond and contact energy were calculated the rmsd data suggests that the receptor-vaccine complex was stabilized after about 20 ns until the end of the simulation fig 4a all the calculations were then done for the 2040 ns md simulation trajectory next rmsf calculation which gives information about the residue wise dynamics of a protein with respect to its initial position was done an average rmsf value of 039 nm was observed for the complex fig 4b our subsequent analysis of the changes in the rg for the vaccine-tlr3 complex during the simulation was also determined and the average rg was found to be 147 nm demonstrating the compactness of the tlr3 receptor with vaccine subunit during the simulations fig 4c we further analyzed the hydrogen bonds that play a vital role in stabilizing protein structure and the recognition of other protein partners in a complex the vaccine-receptor complex formed an average of 327 hydrogen bonds suggesting the favorable intermolecular interactions between the vaccine protein and the tlr3 receptor the formation of a large number of hydrogen bonds and its stabilization during simulations reflect the specificity and selectivity of intermolecular interactions fig 4d in total the complex formed about 5369 bonds during the 40 ns simulation run next we further computed the contact energy for the vaccine-tlr3 complex and it was found that while the starting complex structure exhibited total contact energy of 81436 kcal mol1 the stabilized complex exhibited total contact energy of 93568 kcal mol1 showing the increased stability during md simulations next we performed ed analysis where pca is one of the important techniques that provide insight into the correlation of atomic movement of protein-protein complexes raised from the collective motion of atoms that are controlled by the secondary structure of the proteins typically the largest associated eigenvalues define the essential subspace in which most of the protein dynamics occur for this the clusters of stable states of pca for the tlr3-vaccine complex were visualized and analyzed the trace value calculated from the covariance matrix of the tlr3-vaccine was found to be 218 nm2 suggesting that the complex exhibited compact behavior during the simulation supplementary fig 3 lastly the detailed interactions between tlr3 and the vaccine protein were computed from the starting structure of md simulations and the stabilized structure of the complex extracted from md simulated trajectory fig 5
and table 5
 the higher total number of interactions in the stabilized complex suggests the stability and tighter binding of the vaccine with tlr3 the codon optimization index ensures the relationship between codon usage and gene expression in a heterologous system the jcat output was further analyzed in nebcutter and at the n- and c-terminal ends of the optimized vaccine sequence bamhi and ndei restriction sites were added that are non-cutters for the vaccine construct but are present in the multiple cloning site of the selected expression vector pet28a in silico clone was generated using the snapgene 113 restriction cloning tool that resulted in a cloned product of 7034 bp fig 6
 some reports suggest that 510 of recovered patients in wuhan test positive again this indicates a possibility of a resurgence of covid-19 in places where lockdowns have already worked as a consequence the spread can also be caused by asymptomatic carriers 31 32 33 a positive re-test however may also be because the original test was false-negative and the patient was not actually covid-negative whatever may be the case a vaccine is a better option for coronavirus management than drugs the efforts to produce a vaccine against coronavirus are moving at a rapid pace two candidate vaccines are in phase i clinical trials i an adenovirus type-5 vector-based vaccine and ii an lnp-encapsulated mrna vaccine studies evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines are underway additionally several vaccine candidates are under preclinical evaluation 34 though these trials are underway there are known situations that vaccines have failed recently few groups have tried designing subunit vaccines against sars-cov-2 however their workflow involved either use of single protein for vaccine design 2425 or used only ctl epitopes without considering the importance of b-cell or htl epitopes 35 we considered all of these points while designing the vaccine based on extensive bioinformatics analysis we used three proteins to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 these proteins are nucleocapsid protein n membrane glycoprotein m and the surface spike glycoprotein s the n protein is involved in packaging the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid and it plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly 36 the m protein is responsible for the assembly and immunogenicity of virus particles the s protein mediates the entrance of the virus to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptor ace2 the s protein has two regions s1 for host cell receptor binding and s2 for membrane fusion the s protein is a key target for the development of vaccines therapeutic antibodies and diagnostics for coronavirus 153738 although the s protein is a promising immunogen for protection optimizing antigen design is critical to ensure an optimal immune response our vaccine contains a suitable adjuvant htl ctl and b-cell epitopes that are joined by suitable linkers furthermore the epitopes were screened for their toxicity potential the subunit vaccine was found to be thermostable antigenic and non-allergenic molecular docking and md simulation provided insights about the interaction stability and dynamics of the vaccine-receptor complex the data suggest constructive intermolecular interactions between the vaccine protein and the tlr-3 receptor also the in-silico cloning suggests the potential expression of the vaccine in a microbial expression system thereby making it a potential vaccine against sars-cov-2 infection the development of a vaccine is a lengthy and expensive process with high failure rates and it typically takes multiple candidates and several years to produce a commercial vaccine upon optimization of the production process the subunit vaccines can be rapidly tested and released in the market they consist of only the antigenic portion of the pathogens that may directly elicit an immune response additionally the vaccine does not utilize live pathogen thus reducing the risk of pathogenicity reversal hence it can be used in immune-suppressed patients as well and elicit long-lived immunity computational studies suggest that our multi-epitope based subunit vaccine has a probability of showing good protective efficacy and safety against sars-cov-2 infection in humans we suggest the synthesis and experimental evaluation of this vaccine to determine its immunogenic potency pk and akp carried out the experiments pk and tt conceived the study and participated in its design and coordination pk akp kyjz and tt analyzed the data and drafted the manuscript all authors read and approved the final manuscript

clinical manifestations careful description of the clinical manifestations of sars as well as correlation of the longitudinal course of disease with clinical virologic and immunologic parameters is an important early goal for clinical research these data would permit clinical investigators to develop a standard set of criteria to delineate progression and thus quantify the impact of different interventions on disease severity moreover systematic correlation of symptoms with histologic cytologic virologic and immunologic evaluations of early and late changes in patient samples would greatly aid the understanding of sars pathogenesis it is also important to identify host and viral factors that are predictors of disease progression understanding the role of host genetics and laboratory surrogates would help to improve prognostic capabilities and allow identification of patients likely to benefit from aggressive interventions such information might also be of value in the development of entry criteria for interventional studies 
clinical virology longitudinal evaluation of viral shedding by use of polymerase chain reaction pcr and viral culture from the lungs gastrointestinal tract and other sites would help in patient management and infection control for example routinely finding infectious virus in stool weeks after resolution of clinical illness would likely change recommendations with regard to isolation such data would also provide information about sites of virus replication and show whether these evolve over the course of illness previous studies of animal coronavirus infections have shown that small changes in viral envelope proteins can have a dramatic effect on both tissue tropism and clinical manifestations for example a single amino acid change in the s or spike protein changes transmissible gastroenteritis virus from a predominantly respiratory pathogen into an intestinal pathogen 12 for this reason evaluation of viral quasi species obtained from different tissues obtained from patients with different clinical manifestations of sars and obtained over time from single patients could be very rewarding error rates during transcription by coronavirus rna-dependent rna polymerases are typically on the order of 1 in 104 which are similar to rates for hiv-1 reverse transcriptase such high rates will likely cause substantial variation in the viral genome to occur over time which could permit drug-resistant isolates to emerge careful surveillance for the development of drug-resistant sars strains should therefore be part of any antiviral research protocol clinical immunology it is important to thoroughly understand cellular and humoral immune responses to the sars virus including the impact of sars on immune function and any immunopathologic responses the virus may engender study of the relationships between specific immune responses and subsequent clinical course would help to identify correlates of protective immunity which would in turn be of great value in the development of vaccines and immune-based therapies because an immunosuppressive element has been described in other coronavirus infections examination of the effect of sars on the ability of the host to generate an immune response to other antigens is indicated such research can be done through studies of immune response to recall antigens such as tetanus toxoid or to primary antigens such as bacteriophage phi x 174 interpretation of such studies must clearly distinguish effects that are specific to sars virus infection from those that are generic to serious illness better understanding of the role of the immune system in sars pathogenesis is critical and would help in the development of new therapeutic strategies these deleterious responses may be specific as in the case of cross-reacting autoantibodies or nonspecific as with an overly robust inflammatory response the severe lymphopenia described in patients with sars remains a mystery but it could be related to immune mechanisms detailed study of bone marrow function and lymphocyte kinetics in individuals with sars may yield important clues to the cause of this anemia 
international collaboration a global network of research centers should be formed to test therapeutic approaches as they are developed and to help conduct the basic clinical research described above these sars clinical centers must be located in countries where sars occurs and must have the cooperation of local communities they must also be appropriately equipped and must have access to the requisite scientific expertise including clinical trial design pharmacology and data management to the extent possible protocols for trials of therapies should be developed in advance of need such trials must be designed to test new antiviral drugs antibody therapies and immunomodulatory approaches such as the use of corticosteroids and the trials must test the application of these therapies to both treatment of symptomatic patients and postexposure prophylaxis see therapeutics for further discussion of therapeutic development 
animal reservoirs sars cov is almost certainly of zoonotic origin coronaviruses have a broad host range in avian and mammalian species the initial sars cases in guangdong province occurred among workers in food preparation and the restaurant industry which suggests that practices associated with live-animal markets in this region were a source of human infections 13 moreover some workers in live-animal markets in shenzhen china showed serologic evidence of sars cov infection without a history of a sars-like illness virologic surveillance in live-animal markets led to the isolation of coronaviruses closely related to sars cov further study of the genetic diversity of related coronaviruses in a broad range of wild and domestic animals may help to identify potential animal reservoirs of sars cov as well as virologic and environmental characteristics that favor zoonotic transmission 
natural history little is known about the natural history of sars cov infection it is also critical that the reproductive rate ro be quantified in different subpopulations settings and climates initial estimates suggest that ro is 3 considerably less than for highly transmissible viruses such as influenza virus ro may change seasonally and a relatively small change may determine whether the virus becomes established in the human population moreover the effect of host factors especially age on viral transmission remains to be clarified children infected with sars cov experience much less severe illness whereas people 60 years of age suffer severe disease and high mortality however it is not yet clear how the probability of viral transmission varies among age groups similarly the prevalence of asymptomatic infection the possibility of transmission through an oral-fecal route or through blood transfusion and the presence of host genetic factors that affect susceptibility have yet to be determined finally the viral host and environmental factors that caused so-called super-spreader incidents in which many people are infected by a single individual should be elucidated as quickly as possible 
infection-control strategies currently the only available strategy for the control of sars is isolation and quarantine because these procedures will be needed to address sars and other emerging infectious agents the social and psychological consequences of isolation and quarantine should be studied and incentives for people to adhere to implemented policies should be assessed the efficacy of other infection-control techniques such as screening for febrile passengers in airports should also be examined 
international collaboration the experience with sars underscores the need to establish collaborative international disease surveillance and research networks especially in southeast asia in march the who rapidly established a global network of sars research centers modeled on a network of influenza surveillance and research centers already in place which helped to facilitate the isolation and identification of sars cov and the complete genomic sequencing of multiple isolates ultimately internationally supported on-site collaborative networks such as these will allow rapid exchange of information and reagents among skilled professionals and therefore enhance research for sars and other emerging infectious disease threats beyond the establishment of collaborative centers it is of utmost importance that scientists worldwide share all available epidemiologic data with regard to sars only analyses of pooled data from all affected countries can adequately clarify such complex issues as the role of super spreaders diarrhea and other factors affecting transmission the identification of risk factors for severe disease outcome and the benefits of various treatment strategies establishing a database linking epidemiologic clinical and laboratory data from individuals with sars worldwide would therefore be of tremendous benefit during the winter months the diagnostic challenges of differentiating sars from other infections is especially great this means that it is essential to develop diagnostic assays that can differentiate sars cov from other respiratory pathogens rapidly simply and precisely it is also important to develop diagnostic tests that are not disease specific but can rapidly recognize the presence of other known and novel pathogens 
serologic assays sars cov was initially identified using cell culture inoculation and passage followed by electron microscopy and genome sequence analysis standard elisas neutralization tests and immunofluorescent antibody assays were developed immediately thereafter use of these tests demonstrated that individuals with sars develop specific antibodies against the virus that do not cross-react with other human coronaviruses and that are not present widely in the population these serologic tests are now widely available in countries where active sars cov transmission has occurred igg antibodies however do not appear for at least 10 days after infection because igm antibodies typically appear earlier igm capture assays should be developed similarly measurement of sars cov-specific iga antibodies in rapid tests designed for use with oral fluids could prove useful 
pcr assays the first complete genome sequence for sars cov was available within 8 weeks after the initial who global alert and 40 distinct isolates have since been deposited in genomic databases 14 the availability of the sars nucleotide sequence allowed rapid development of standard and reversetranscriptase pcr assays that can detect sars cov rna in respiratory secretions lung and kidney tissues and stool and urine specimens pcr assays are exquisitely sensitive with a detection limit of 10100 copies of the target rna however the presence of viral rna does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus and the methods exceptional sensitivity may lead to false-positive results because of cross-contamination and other factors continued work to standardize the performance of pcr assays for sars and to determine optimal protocols remains a high priority 
reagent repositories reagents such as infectious virus viral rna inactivated and recombinant antigens and sars cov-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are essential tools for the development of diagnostic assays as are wellvalidated clinical specimens from individuals with sars global public health authorities should therefore continue to coordinate the collection storage and distribution of this material perhaps through existing or new who collaborating research centers alternatively the niaid might consider including this material in the reagent repository now planned to support assay development for bioterror threat agents moreover because initial development of diagnostic assays and reagents can also be done using specimens from animal models improvement of such models should continue 
antiviral drug screening although antiviral chemotherapy and prophylaxis will be of great importance in the control of sars no clinically proven candidates currently exist working collaboratively the united states army medical research institute of infectious diseases the niaid and the centers for disease control and prevention established a sars antiviral drug-screening laboratory in march 2003 the assay used at that laboratory measured how much candidate compounds inhibit cytopathic effects of sars cov growing in cultured vero cells initially the antiviral drugs screened included those that are us food and drug administration approved those in clinical development and those for which preclinical data suggested activity against a potential viral target protein some in vitro activity against sars cov was observed with certain preparations of interferon- and - as well as with rimantadine at high concentrations and a cysteine protease inhibitor 
antiviral drug design molecular virologic and genetic studies of sars cov and other coronaviruses suggest several possible molecular targets for antiviral drugs these include viral binding fusion and other activities mediated by the glycoprotein spike on the coronavirus surface as well as the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase the papain-like cysteine protease and the chymotrypsin-picornavirus 3c-like protease inhibitors of surface hemagglutinin-esterase or other activities involved in release of virus from cell surfaces may also represent a class of useful antiviral drugs molecular modeling and drug design strategies should continue to be pursued to develop compounds that modulate these viral activities 
immunomodulation and other therapies available clinical and histopathologic data suggest that immune-mediated injury may be an important mechanism in sars pathogenesis particularly late in the course of illness thus it would be useful to assess the use of immunomodulatory drugs such as corticosteroids either by themselves or in combination with antivirals the effectiveness of administration of immunoglobulins with neutralizing activity against sars cov for both therapy and prophylaxis should also be examined 
preclinical studies both nonhuman primate and smallanimal models are needed for sars antiviral drug development mouse hepatitis virus a group ii murine coronavirus has been well characterized in mice and may prove to be useful in this regard although it may differ significantly from sars cov it may in the end prove necessary to develop several models to address different aspects of the pathogenesis of sars such as systemic versus respiratory tract infection the niaid should also strengthen its ability to produce sufficient supplies of promising experimental compounds to conduct preclinical toxicology studies and should continue to expand biocontainment laboratory facilities a shortage of which has significantly inhibited antiviral development collaboration between the us food and drug administration and antiviral drug developers should occur at early stages of the development process both to assess preclinical data and to plan clinical studies clinical trial networks such as the niaids collaborative anti-viral studies group casg should be expanded and strengthened particularly to include sites in countries where sars has occurred collaborative clinical protocols should be prepared casg has developed a clinical protocol that could be used as a template for the establishment of such collaborative studies these clinical protocols should look not only at disease progression but also at titer of excreted virus and duration of excretion which are probable markers for the likelihood of transmission 
basic science because sars has just emerged many important basic science issues have not yet been fully explored these include the identity of the cellular receptor for the virus the pathogenic mechanisms that cause disease the initial routes of infection and the role that enteric infection plays in pathogenesis or transmission immunologic issues that warrant intense study include the relative roles of innate and adaptive immunity a detailed description of the immunologic response throughout the course of disease whether patients are immune from reinfection after recovery and what immune system changes might confer immunity experience to date indicates that the immune response might play a role in sars pathogenesis which has important implications for both treatment and vaccine development it is encouraging that useful vaccines for some animal coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus have been developed using various strategies including live-attenuated whole-killed and subunit approaches however experimental vaccines based on these strategies directed against feline infectious peritonitis virus enhance disease in immunized animals it is crucial therefore that any immune responses that contribute to disease be identified as soon as possible and that sars vaccine candidates be evaluated for the possibility that they might potentiate disease 
vaccine development given the need for quick development of a safe and effective sars vaccine multiple strategies for vaccine development should be pursued simultaneously these include the development of live-attenuated and whole-killed vaccine candidates in addition to other strategies that elicit strong t cell responses such dna-based vaccines and engineered adenovirus vectors as well as those that elicit production of neutralizing antibodies adjuvants that confer longer-lived protective mucosal and systemic immune responses should also be pursued finally subunit vaccines based on s protein fragments and peptides and epitope-based t cell vaccines formulated with new adjuvants that target toll-like receptors should also be developed 
preclinical testing animal models of sars cov infection are needed to test the safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines a reagent repository from which researchers could obtain recombinant viral proteins multiple spike proteins monoclonal antibodies plasmids and immune and control patient sera would be extremely helpful as would a molecular and immunology database containing descriptions of t and b cell epitopes and sars cov genomic data moving candidate sars vaccines rapidly through scientific and regulatory evaluation will require a coordinated effort of government academic and industrial organizations these groups should work together to identify potential barriers to product licensing and should cooperatively develop plans for widespread testing and deployment of promising vaccine preparations in countries where sars exists the first wave of sars was controlled by vigorous international application of the time-tested techniques of isolation and quarantine and the international research response was both forceful and cooperative in short order the virus that causes sars was identified and sequenced first-generation diagnostic tests were developed and distributed and development of both antiviral therapies and vaccines was initiated much of this progress was achieved through an international network of research sites that was built largely on a preexisting influenza network it is a reflection of the astonishingly rapid pace of sars research that the niaid meeting summarized above at which a great many fundamental insights into sars were described occurred only 10 weeks after the initial who global health alert progress in sars research has continued even as the first wave of the disease has subsided and several identified research needs have been at least partially met for example in vitro screening of antiviral candidates against sars cov is now moving at an accelerated pace as a result of the recent introduction of high-throughput assays that can screen up to 1000 compounds per week in addition many sars vaccine candidates are in development around the world and preliminary results from tests in mice and nonhuman primates indicate that neutralizing antibodies are protective some vaccine candidates that elicit neutralizing antibodies may shortly enter human trials 15 by the same token however several needs that cut across various fields of sars research remain unfulfilled table 6 although some progress has been reported in many of these areas as well the most pressing of these needs are described below 
methods for early identification of individuals with sars many pcr and serologic diagnostic kits are available and other diagnostic tools are under development 16 existing diagnostic tests however are not able to detect sars cov with high specificity early in the course of infection in clinical specimens that are relatively easily obtained poon et al 17 reported that real-time pcr coupled with an improved rna extraction method allows detection of viral rna in nasopharyngeal aspirates with 80 specificity a considerable improvement over first-generation procedures this research was made possible by the availability of a set of well-characterized clinical samples from individuals with confirmed sars coupled with matched controls rigorous testing of diagnostic procedures using standardized samples remains a challenge to the international community however in addition a more complete understanding of where in the body the virus can be found at different stages of the disease might lead to new diagnostic strategies for example the report that sars cov can replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in individuals with sars shortly after the onset of symptoms indicates that blood might be an appropriate clinical specimen for diagnosis 1819 availability of a highly accurate and specific diagnostic assay that could detect sars cov before or shortly after the onset of symptoms would be a tremendously valuable public health tool in any future sars outbreaks 20 
sars pathogenesis and immune response a complete understanding of sars pathogenesis together with a full picture of the human immune response has not yet been achieved in this regard it is particularly important to understand what role if any the human immune response plays in severe disease outcomes a recent report describing changes in cytokine concentrations in 61 patients seropositive for sars cov in beijing at early peak and recovery stages of the disease indicates that the immune system responds abnormally to the virus 21 this is the kind of study that can provide useful insights into both pathogenic mechanisms and the effectiveness of experimental therapies another report indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for sars cov 22 further work to systematically unravel all aspects of how sars cov interacts with its human host at the molecular and physiologic levels will help ensure rapid development of therapeutic techniques diagnostic assays and vaccines 
sars animal models it has been shown that the virus will replicate in several small animals including masked palm civets raccoon dogs mice domestic cats and nonhuman primates researchers have a variety of animal models from which to choose the development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies will rely on several different models because each will have advantages in different experimental settings however no animal model described to date can reliably mimic the respiratory symptoms seen in humans with sars a recent report indicates that sars-infected ferrets become ill although these animals show no evidence of pneumonia 23 follow-up work on these and other animals might lead to the discovery of an animal model that reproduces sars symptoms in humans 
enhanced mechanisms for international cooperation access to well-characterized specimens and reagents is still a limiting factor for many avenues of sars research although some progress has been made 13 24 25 moreover increased compilation and analysis of existing epidemiologic laboratory and clinical data from multiple sars-affected areas would speed research for example no single site has had a sufficient number of super-spreading events to provide enough data to completely explain them however data pooled from many sites in different countries would provide a much greater chance of explaining this important phenomenon similarly data on the success or failure of the various treatment strategies already attempted should be rigorously compared and analyzed finally although protocols for clinical testing of therapeutic and vaccine candidates have been prepared common protocols should be implemented across multiple international sites and data acquired during these trials should be made widely available as they are acquired to combat sars the international public health community must effectively harness the experience and creative talents of laboratory scientists public health workers physicians and other health care workers all over the world although the intense effort exerted in the first months of 2003 controlled the initial outbreaks we must not be lulled into a false sense of security the pandemic potential of sars a novel agent transmitted via respiratory secretions remains present today it serves as a reminder that the emergence of pathogens whether natural or intentional can have devastating human and economic costs for these reasons planning efforts for future pandemics must be sufficiently flexible to cope with any emerging respiratory virus performing the research needed to effectively counter sars will require both a continued global investment of human and financial resources and an ongoing commitment to collaborative sharing of data

major loss of life and socioeconomic disruption in the region in early 2014 an outbreak of ebola virus disease caused by zaire ebolavirus started in west africa and was declared a public health emergency of international concern in august of that year by the time the outbreak ended in 2016 more than 11000 people had died and more than 28000 people were infected primarily in three countries guinea liberia and sierra leone1 in the decade prior to the west african outbreak research efforts for biodefense purposes resulted in the identification of some promising ebola vaccine candidates that protected monkeys from a lethal challenge of wild-type ebola virus2 these vaccine candidates were not taken into clinical development prior to the west african outbreak for several reasons which included the inability to demonstrate clinical efficacy in the absence of an ongoing outbreak and lack of interest by the public health and vaccine development community to invest in the lengthy and costly process of vaccine development without a clear demand for an ebola vaccine2 the west african outbreak changed this perspective and numerous vaccines entered clinical development during the outbreak resulting in the generation of safety and immunogenicity data for many of these novel vaccine candidates and the demonstration of efficacy for one vaccine3 ervebo is a live attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus rvsv-based chimeric-vector vaccine where the vsv envelope g protein was deleted and replaced by inserting only the envelope glycoprotein of zaire ebolavirus extraordinary efforts were made to advance this vaccine candidate through phase 1 2 and 3 clinical trials and the data generated in the context of the west african ebola outbreak has supported its licensure by the us food and drug administration fda conditional authorization by the european medicines agency ema and several african countries along with prequalification by the who the period of 5 years from the start of phase 1 trials in oct 2014 to the approval of this vaccine in nov 2019 was much faster than the typical 1015 year timeline for vaccine development and approval4 a timeline of the key activities in the development of this ebola vaccine is summarized in fig 1 and described in detail in the following sections of this article through this ebola vaccine development effort a number of learnings have been identified which are highly relevant for the current vaccine development efforts in response to the covid-19 pandemic a summary of the key lessons learned can be found in fig 2 this ebola vaccine was initially designed as a biodefense vaccine by scientists at the public health agency of canada phac preclinical studies performed by phac and their collaborators demonstrated that a single-dose of the vaccine candidate was highly efficacious in animal models in preparation for potential clinical studies or emergency use phac partnered with idt biologika to prepare gmp supplies beginning in the autumn of 2014 a diverse set of public-private partners mobilized to collaborate on the evaluation and development of the vaccine candidate the global collaboration spanned a broad range of organizations including national governments such as canada the united states and african countries various agencies such as the phac us national institutes of health us centers for disease control and protection us biomedical advanced research and development authority us defense threat reduction agency field response and non-governmental service organizations such as medecins sans frontieres global public health entities such as the world health organization wellcome trust and gavi universities eg the university of geneva dalhousie university and private sector companies such as newlink genetics idt biologika and msd each of these entities had a specific role in the broad partnership including conducting preclinical studies manufacturing good manufacturing practices gmp trial materials conducting clinical trials and funding portions of the research and development msd has a well-established history in manufacturing and clinical development of vaccines with experience in taking novel vaccines through the regulatory process to approval and providing global access however msd did not have prior experience with ebola virus nor clinical development expertise in the african countries in which the ebola outbreak was taking place therefore msd relied on the expertise of organizations that were already involved in the public health response efforts to implement and complete nearly all the clinical trials important lessons from this effort are that leveraging the expertise of different organizations can help to accelerate product development and that broad public-private partnerships require strong leadership and coordination to facilitate cooperation of diverse partners with different expertise and missions furthermore concerns over evaluation of any investigational product are present in less developed parts of the world and these concerns may be further exacerbated during an outbreak5 therefore clear and transparent communication with community leaders and the community at large ethical review committees local ministries of health and other government agencies is critical to ensure that the purpose of the research is well understood and aligned with accepted local and international norms failure to do so can result in delays or roadblocks to research on potentially life-saving products msds role in advancing the product to licensure included integrating all the data generated by partners to support the marketing authorization applications nine of 13 nonclinical studies 1 of 2 clinical assay validations and 11 of 12 clinical trials were performed by partners msd needed to obtain all the datasets and reports from these partners to include in the license applications data from clinical trials that were performed by partners needed to be migrated into a central database that could be used for data integration analysis report-writing and submission by msd to regulatory agencies a lesson learned during this process is to account for the time needed to convert different formats and languages used to collect the data into standard formats required by regulatory agencies such as use of the medical dictionary for regulatory activities meddra and study data tabulation model sdtm with the clinical trials all being designed and implemented in the context of the outbreak it was not possible to harmonize the study designs while this is not an issue a priori for the conduct of the trials it introduced challenges when assembling the data to support licensure for example it was not possible to conduct extensive integration of the safety data for the product because the data collected and methods used were different for each trial a key lesson learned during this process is that standardization of clinical trial protocols and data collection is preferred and that to the extent possible late stage clinical trial designs should be defined prior to outbreaks another challenge specifically related to conducting trials in response to emerging diseases is that there is a need to build clinical development capacities laboratory and adverse event reporting infrastructure in outbreak-prone regions this was a challenge taken on by individual trial sponsors in the affected countries and required significant and sustained support by the trial sponsors and their local partners establishing mechanisms to maintain the capabilities established during outbreak response to provide experienced clinical trial sites for future research is another key lesson learned examples of this in action include the ongoing partnership between the us and liberia and the partnership for research on ebola vaccination prevac consortium established in the wake of the west africa outbreak a key immunogenicity endpoint assay was developed and validated through a collaborative effort by private and public sector partners the intent was to provide an assay available to all vaccine developers which might ultimately allow comparison of different vaccine candidates while the collaborative effort was successful balancing the input of numerous partners took time consequently clinical assay validation took two years to complete resulting in a back-log of samples from clinical trials that needed to be processed a lesson learned is that whenever possible clinical immunogenicity sample collection should be standardized and assays should be validated prior to the start of late stage clinical trials this requires knowledge of the target pathogen well in advance of clinical trials which is a challenge for sars-cov-2 with the rapid collection of efficacy data in support of the vaccine it was recognized that there was the possibility that new ebola outbreaks could occur ahead of the licensure and availability of licensed doses and that a mechanism was needed to support access to the investigational product for this scenario it was necessary to manufacture doses to support outbreak response and establish regulatory frameworks needed to support vaccine deployment eg compassionate use expanded access or emergency use the who msf and other groups took the lead in implementing expanded access protocols in african countries working closely with national governments and ministries of health through this effort more than 300000 people were vaccinated during the 20182020 ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of the congo6 a lesson learned is that the deployment of an investigational product requires careful consideration and thorough planning the manufacturing process had to be rapidly scaled-up to handle the needs for emergency use and expanded access programs in addition to establishing a final manufacturing facility the approach taken by msd was to take the initial manufacturing process that was developed at a contract manufacturing organization scale it up in a clinical manufacturing facility and transfer it to a commercial manufacturing facility technology transfer and the establishment of a new manufacturing facility has many steps and requires significant time to execute 34 years is typical for a new vaccine there is limited understanding outside of vaccine manufacturers and regulators on the rigorous requirements leading to approval of a vaccine manufacturing facility this broad lack of understanding can lead to misperceptions of delays when in fact timelines are driven by the elements required for licensure for example although clinical data were available in 20172018 the vaccine could not be approved until the commercial manufacturing site was established due to expectations from regulatory agencies that the manufacturing process needs to be validated at the final manufacturing site a lesson learned is that education is needed on how vaccines are manufactured and the time needed to establish and gain approval for a new manufacturing facility this is particularly relevant for the covid-19 outbreak where all aspects of vaccine development are being accelerated at an extraordinary pace with the goal of being able to produce unprecedented quantities of vaccine to address global needs manufacturing site selection for vaccines is a complex decision which is further complicated when seeking to move fast with incomplete information the company needed to manage multiple factors such as existing space technical capability infrastructure and capacity site selection also needed to account for the regulations in the country in which the manufacturing site is located and the permits and licenses necessary to support the efforts the countrys employment environment and labor laws can also impact the ability to hire qualified staff quickly where these factors need to be considered early a lesson learned is that aggressive timelines are enticing for public health partners but also require right-first-time execution to qualify the facility and manufacturing process for which the probability of success for a new vaccine is likely medium to low all parties involved must work to balance the desire to be ambitious eg rapid development timelines with execution realities and stakeholder expectations parallel work and extensive collaboration between manufacturers will be needed in order to successfully bring a sars-cov-2 vaccine to the world from the start of the west african ebola outbreak the us fda ema and health canada worked closely with each other and with the national regulatory authorities of the impacted west african countries sharing information about candidate vaccines that were being tested and reviewing the clinical protocols available data and benefit-risk profiles frequent conversations with manufacturers helped the agencies expedite the start of clinical trials simultaneously in different countries a lesson learned is that existing preclinical data and availability of clinical supplies afforded the opportunity to start phase 1 trials rapidly during the west african ebola outbreak placebo-controlled randomized double-blind studies are typically used to demonstrate the efficacy and safety for new vaccines however in the midst of the ebola outbreak some countries considered it unethical to administer placebo to at-risk individuals different study designs were implemented for the phase 23 trials and a cluster-randomized trial conducted by the world health organization in guinea was the only trial that demonstrated efficacy7 efficacy data from this trial together with safety data from 12 trials and immunogenicity data with validated assays were accepted for registration by regulatory agencies a lesson learned is that the regulatory pathway to licensure for pandemic vaccines need to be clearly defined novel trial designs might need to be implemented in order to maximize the possibility of evaluating efficacy during a waning outbreak and alternative endpoints such as using immune responses as a surrogate for efficacy could be used to gain accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization based primarily on interim clinical efficacy data the manufacturer applied for and was granted access to expedited regulatory pathways such as priority medicines prime status from ema and breakthrough therapy designation btd from fda which helped to obtain alignment on data requirements for product approval using frequent meetings under btd the fda accepted rolling submissions of portions of the biologics license application bla which resulted in approval in december 2019 three months before fdas target approval date the fda determined that a program specific advisory committee meeting was not needed similar frequent discussions with ema under prime status enabled the company to gain alignment on key aspects of the development program quickly who is a recognized global public health leader with regional offices in many countries and established connections with the african vaccines regulatory forum avaref in order to accelerate vaccine access to african countries the world health organizations prequalification team who-pqt in collaboration with the ema and avaref developed an innovative facilitated process roadmap for decision making on the acceptability of the vaccine for registration8 this allowed the company to make simultaneous submissions to ema who-pqt and regulatory authorities in 14 african countries with ema acting as the reference agency following submission the who-pqt and members from avaref which represented the 14 african countries were invited to participate in teleconferences between msd and ema and in the inspection of the manufacturing facility after a positive opinion from ema in october 2019 the european commission granted a conditional marketing authorization on november 11th within 36 h the who granted prequalification one month later african countries started to approve ervebo starting with burundi and the democratic republic of the congo a lesson learned is that strong collaboration and willingness to share information with everyone involved resulted in registration nearly-simultaneously in the countries that needed the ebola vaccine for sars-cov-2 vaccines regulatory agencies should prepare for the simultaneous approval of candidates in multiple countries whos leadership will be needed to facilitate innovative review processes and collaborative mechanisms to expedite approvals since this ebola vaccine was a recombinant virus some countries required a detailed environmental risk assessment prior to the start of clinical trials and as part of the marketing authorization application in some countries the vaccine was considered a bio-safety level 2 organism requiring special handling and permits for the manufacturing and testing sites these permits took a significant amount of time to obtain which prevented rapid transfers of material samples and technology which even included parts of the marketing authorization application required licenses for export because this vaccine is made from the genetic sequence of two viruses that are considered dual-use agents and subject to trade controls a lesson learned is that these regulations led to delays and additional costs incurred in starting clinical trials manufacturing testing and shipments for manufacturers of sars-cov-2 vaccines countries should consider waiving these requirements or waiving the fees and expediting these processes after approval companies face challenges with product distribution due to the need to follow country-specific product labeling regulations covering package inserts cartons and artwork in addition to serialization requirements this causes a supply chain issue for a vaccine product intended to be placed in a stockpile and diverted quickly to any country a lesson learned is that these heterogenous requirements counter the goal of flexibility speed and cost-efficiency relevant to emergency preparedness and there is an urgent need for harmonized solutions electronic labeling and quick response qr codes could be a possible solution but in most countries legislation does not currently exist to support this option there is an urgent need to find a solution to this problem for pandemic vaccines in addition to considering lessons related to vaccine development for epidemic preparedness it is equally important to consider the unique challenges and opportunities related to sustainable manufacturing supply access and delivery of these vaccines at the scale and speed needed to achieve preparedness and response goals such challenges include right-sizing manufacturing capacity and production while having to accommodate lead-times managing uncertain demand-and-supply dynamics ensuring equitable allocation and access and achieving operational and economic sustainability for all partners producing and supplying any vaccine is inherently complex it is exponentially more complex when there are high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability across nearly every dimension of the program unpredictable disease unpredictable and relatively low demand unpredictable stakeholders and customers unpredictable timing of need and unpredictable geographies in which needs might arise policy program and system innovationin parallel to research and development innovationneeds to be addressed to realize the full promise of innovative new vaccines in advancing global public health preparedness emergency preparedness and response vaccines such as ervebo are critical tools in the arsenal against pathogens that can cause pandemics public-private partnerships are a powerful and effective approach to develop these vaccines setting clear roles expectations and accountability enables each partner to bring their respective strengths to the effort shared purpose trust flexibility and cooperation are critical to ensure success as highlighted in this report and in another recent article9 the variability and complexity in regulatory processes and requirements interfere with the speed flexibility and efficiency needed to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies there is an urgent need for global regulatory harmonization and standardization in the approach to the development of vaccines for emergency preparedness regulatory agencies need to work together to remove roadblocks and put solutions in place to allow the rapid global development of vaccines for sars-cov-2 and other emerging pathogens  receptor-binding domain of sars-cov spike protein induces long-term protective immunity in an animal model lanying du guangyu zhao yuxian he yan guo bo-jian zheng shibo jiang yusen zhou   severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a novel infectious disease caused by sars coronavirus sars-cov which led to several hundred deaths among thousands of cases although sars has been successfully contained re-emergence of sars-cov from animal reservoirs is still a potential risk for future epidemic which is supported by continual reports of finding sars-cov-like coronavirus in small animals such as civets raccoon dogs 1 2 3 and bats 4 5 sars outbreak may also recur in the future by the virus escaping from laboratory accidents 6 7 therefore development of safe and effective sars vaccines for prevention of sars-cov infection is an important issue on current sars research sars-cov the causative agent of sars contains the genome encoding the nonstructural replicase polyprotein rep and structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n 8 9 its s protein is responsible for virus binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and subsequent virus entry into the host cells 10 11 the s protein of sars-cov has also been demonstrated to be the main antigen in inducing high titer of neutralizing antibodies 12 13 14 and in eliciting protective immunity against infection in challenged animals 15 16 17 thus it is implied to be the main target in development of sars vaccines a number of vaccine candidates based on sars-cov s have been reported in terms of their abilities in inducing neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity 15 18 19 20 these candidates can be grouped into inactivated viruses-based protein-based dna-based and virus-based vaccines 18 20 21 22 23 many viruses including vsv rhabdovirus adenovirus adeno-associated virus aav modified vaccinia virus ankara mva and attenuated parainfluenza virus have been used for expressing sars-cov s protein as sars vaccine candidates 12 15 24 25 26 27 bukreyev et al 24 reported that vaccination of african green monkeys with an attenuated parainfluenza virus encoding sars-cov s resulted in production of sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies and protection of animals from virus challenge these findings suggest that s protein of sars-cov is a good target for development of sars-cov vaccines since most dna-based and virus-based vaccine candidates have still caused some safety concerns protein-based vaccine may be an alternative candidate indeed the full-length s protein or its s1 subunit could induce potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized animals 13 25 28 however it may also elicit antibodies that enhance virus infection 25 29 or cause liver damage in animals challenged with sars-cov 23 in this regard the receptor-binding domain rbd a fragment of the s protein which has been demonstrated to be a major neutralization determinant has implied to be an ideal candidate for development of subunit vaccines against sars 30 31 32 33 34 in this study we further evaluated its long-term immune responses and protective immunity against sars-cov infection in a mouse model the bj01 strain of sars-cov genbank accession no ay278488 was propagated in vero e6 cells under the conditions of the biosafety level 3 laboratories bsl-3 35 36 titer of this virus strain was determined by the 50 tissue-culture infectious dose tcid50 in vero e6 cells a 193-aa rbd domain of sars-cov s protein residues 318510 fused with the fc domain of human igg1 rbd-fc was produced as described previously 30 31 briefly a plasmid encoding rbd-fc fusion protein was transfected into hek293t cells using fugene 6 transfection reagents boehringer mannheim according to the manufacturers protocol supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection recombinant rbd-fc protein was purified by protein a-sepharose 4 fast flow amersham biosciences usa a full-length s protein of sars-cov urbani accession no ay278741 expressed in expressf insect cells with recombinant baculovirus d3252 was purchased from the protein sciences corporation bridgeport ct 13 14 a group of five female balbc mice at the age of 46 weeks were vaccinated intramuscularly im with 10 g of purified rbd-fc resuspended in phosphate-buffered solution pbs ph 72 in the presence of freunds complete adjuvant fca and boosted twice with freshly prepared emulsion of 5 g immunogen and freunds incomplete adjuvant fia at 3-week intervals the mice were boosted for the third time with the same amount of rbd-fc  fia 12 months after the first vaccination and were challenged with sars-cov 5 days later fig 1
 mice injected with the same amount of pbs were used as the negative control for each group mouse sera were collected before immunization and at 1-month interval post-vaccination sera were kept at 20 c until use mouse sera were tested against the recombinant sars-cov s protein by elisa briefly 1 gml of the recombinant s protein was coated to 96-well microtiter plates corning costar acton ma in 01 m carbonate buffer ph 96 at 4 c overnight after blocking with 2 non-fat milk serially diluted mouse sera were added and incubated at 37 c for 1 h followed by three washes with pbs containing 01 tween 20 bound antibodies were detected with hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg zymed south san francisco ca at 37 c for 1 h after three washes the reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3355-tetramethylbenzidine tmb and measured for the absorbance at 450 nm a450 by an elisa plate reader victor 1420 multilabel counter perkin-elmer usa titers of the neutralizing antibody in mouse sera vaccinated with the recombinant rbd-fc protein were detected in vero e6 cells as described by qu et al 37 briefly vero e6 cells were seeded at 2  104
 cellswell in 96-well culture plates and cultured at 37 c for 24 h to form a monolayer serial two-fold dilutions of serum samples were incubated with 100 tcid50 of sars-cov bj01 strain at 37 c for 1 h and subsequently added to the monolayer of vero e6 cells at tetrad cells infected with 100 tcid50 sars-cov and without the virus were applied as positive and negative controls respectively cytopathic effect cpe in each well was observed daily and recorded on day 3 post-infection the neutralizing titers of mouse antisera that completely prevented cpe in 50 of the wells were calculated by reed-muench method five days after the last boost with rbd-fc mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally in inoculated with 50 l of diluted sars-cov bj01 strain 106 tcid50 according to the national animal care and use guidelines in a bsl-3 laboratory vaccinated mice were sacrificed 5 days after the challenge and lungs of the mice were removed the lung tissues were stored at 80 c for virological tests or were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde and stored at 4 c for histopathological analysis the viral rna copies in lung tissues were determined by q-rt-pcr according to the protocol described by zhai et al 38 the limit of detection for live virus in lung samples was 1  103

  16  104 mean  se at the 3rd and 4th month post-vaccination although the titer decreased slightly afterwards high titer of s-specific igg antibody maintained for at least 6 months until it dropped to 190  102
  16  102 at the end of the 7th month specific igg antibody increased rapidly after the 3rd boost 12 months after the first vaccination and reached the titer of 125  103
  77  102 before sars-cov challenge fig 2b further demonstrated that the antibodies induced by vaccination of rbd-fc exhibited strong neutralizing activity with a similar pattern of the elisa antibodies to rbd the neutralizing antibodies reached the highest level at the 3rd month 140  103
  35  102 after the vaccination with rbd-fc the neutralizing antibody level slightly decreased to 158  102
  10  102 by the end of the 6th month but dropped down to less than 140 at the end of the 12th month the titer of the neutralizing antibody to sars-cov increased again after the third boost reaching the titer of 132  102
  19  102 before sars-cov challenge however neither elisa s-specific antibodies nor neutralizing antibodies were detected in the mouse sera from the control group five days after challenged with sars-cov through the intranasal route mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were collected virus rna copies in the lung tissues were determined by q-rt-pcr and described as rna copiesg of tissues as shown in table 1
 viral rna copies for both the rbd-fc group and the control group were negatively correlated with the titer of the neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov the higher titer of the neutralizing antibodies was detected in the sera the lower copy number of viral rna was found in the lung tissues m1 mouse in the rbd-fc vaccination group developed the lowest titer of neutralizing antibody 157 and showed detectable viral rna copies 313  103 while no viral rna was detectable in lung tissues of the other four mice in this group as they presented higher titers of the neutralizing antibody 1189 similarly no neutralizing antibody response in the pbs control group was correlated to the higher levels of rna copies in the lung tissues 139  105 to 377  107 these results suggested that the neutralizing antibodies induced by rbd-fc vaccination play an important role in prevention of sars-cov infection in virus challenged mice sars-cov replication was detected by titration of the inoculated virus in lung tissues to evaluate the efficacy of rbd-fc vaccination in protecting sars-cov infection fig 3
 all of five mice in the control group vaccinated with pbs had high titers of virus replication in the lungs after the sars-cov challenge however the mice vaccinated with rbd-fc were either completely four of five mice or partially protected one of five mice m1 which showed lower level of neutralizing antibody in its serum from sars-cov challenge these data indicate that vaccination with rbd-fc is able to establish protective immunity to prevent mice from subsequent sars-cov challenge histopathological changes in lungs from the rbd-fc vaccinated and control mice were observed on the he stained lung tissue sections lung tissues from the control mice injected with pbs revealed significant histopathological changes including diffuse alveolar damages characterized by disruption of alveolar walls and flooding of alveolar lumina with serosanguineous exudates admixed with neutrophils and alveolar macrophages thickened alveolar walls lined by type 2 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages in alveolar lumina fig 4a however except m1 mouse with a mild level of the alveolar damage in lung tissues other four rbd-fc vaccinated mice exhibited no significant histopathological changes but showed similar histological structures as the normal mouse in lung tissues fig 4b these results further confirm that rbd-fc vaccine is able to prevent mice from subsequent sars-cov infection development of effective and safe sars vaccines is crucial in prevention of re-occurrence of sars epidemic among four structural proteins of sars-cov s serves as the most important antigen for development of sars vaccines since it plays essential roles in the host cell tropism and virus entry and its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity 13 17 20 39 40 reports have shown that neutralizing antibodies against s protein protect vaccinated animals from sars-cov challenge thus vaccines encoding the s protein and targeting the humoral immune responsesneutralizing antibodies are indispensable in preventing sars-cov infection 16 17 20 28 39 40 most of the currently reported sars vaccine candidates are based on the full-length s protein of sars-cov although the full-length s protein-based vaccines can elicit neutralizing antibodies andor protective immunity 13 17 20 it has been reported that this kind of vaccines may also induce harmful inflammatory and immune responses 23 29 this has raised concerns about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines containing or encoding the full-length s protein we thus proposed to use rbd a fragment of s protein rather than the full-length s protein for development of a safe and effective sars subunit vaccine since it contains the major neutralizing epitopes 31 32 41 our previous studies have shown that the recombinant rbd can induce high potent neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov and its variants 31 34 but we do not know whether the rbd-based vaccine can protect animals from sars-cov infection in this study we compared the antibody responses and protective immunity in mice vaccinated with rbd-fc and the control mice we found that rbd-fc elicited potent and long-term humoral immune responses in vaccinated mice high titers of sars-cov s-specific elisa antibodies and virus neutralizing antibodies were maintained for at least 6 months although the antibodies dropped to a low level at the end of the 12th month their titers rebound rapidly after the mice were re-boosted with rbd-fc these vaccinated mice were protected from sars-cov challenge since no significant virus replication was detected in their lungs notably presence of high titers of the neutralizing antibody was a prerequisite for protective immunity higher titer of neutralizing antibodies was associated with lower level of rna copiesvirus replication and stronger protective activity against sars-cov challenge among five mice vaccinated with rbd-fc four mice possessing high titer of neutralizing antibodies exhibited no significant virus replication and histopathological changes in their lungs while only one mouse with low sera neutralizing antibody titer showed marginal level of virus rna copies and mild histopathological changes however all of the five mice with undetectable neutralizing antibody in the control group presented high level of rna copiesvirus replication and obvious histopathological changes in their lungs our results indicated that the neutralizing antibody produced in rbd-fc vaccinated mice plays a significant role in protection of mice from the virus challenge without causing immunopathological damages in summary the vaccines containing the rbd of sars-cov s protein may induce sufficient neutralizing antibodies and long-term protective immunity against sars-cov challenge in the established mouse model this vaccine candidate may overcome the disadvantages of other vaccine candidates mentioned above but protect the vaccinated mice from subsequent sars-cov challenge our results suggest that rbd-fc vaccine can be further developed as an ideal subunit vaccine for prevention of sars epidemic  modified vaccinia virus ankara as antigen delivery system how can we best use its potential ingo drexler caroline staib gerd sutter   poxviruses engineered to express foreign genes are established tools for target protein synthesis and vaccine development in biomedical research a large packaging capacity for recombinant dna precise virus-specific control of target gene expression lack of persistence or genomic integration in the host high immunogenicity as vaccine and ease of vector and vaccine production were important features enabling this success story concerns about the safety of poxviruses including vaccinia virus vv as the former smallpox vaccine have been addressed by the use of viruses that are replication-defective in human cells among these modified vaccinia virus ankara mva can be considered as one of the virus strains of choice for preclinical and clinical research 1 historically mva was developed through attenuation by serial passage in primary chicken embryo cells to serve as a safer vaccine against smallpox for a review see 2 after more than 570 passages in tissue culture mva had lost the broad cellular host range of vv being unable to productively grow in many cells of mammalian origin the concurrent avirulence of mva for laboratory animals and its entirely unproblematic use for primary smallpox vaccination in more than 100 000 humans founded a high safety profile for recombinant mva that depending on the nature of the inserted target gene can be used under conditions of biosafety level 1 the capacity to produce similar levels of viral and recombinant antigen when compared with replication-competent viruses is a relevant feature of mva vaccines in recent years significant progress has been made in the development of mva vaccine technologies this review informs about the newest developments in the generation of recombinant mva and illustrates the principal features that have an impact on mva immunogenicity we also describe advances made in the preclinical and clinical evaluation of mva as a second-generation poxvirus vaccine or for the delivery of heterologous antigens targeting infectious diseases and cancer finally we consider the compatibility of different mva exploitations and raise the question as to what future use priority should be given recombinant mva are among the most promising live viral vector systems because of their well-established safety and their versatility for the production of heterologous proteins the recent engineering of recombinant mva to synthesize all components necessary for the assembly and delivery of alphavirus replicon particles serves as an elegant example of their application 3 for most purposes however the generation of mva vectors is straightforward requiring a single genomic insertion mediated by homologous recombination between the virus genome and dna from a plasmid that carries one or two recombinant genes being placed under control of a vv-specific promoter figure 1
 the sites of naturally occurring deletions within the mva genome or the classical gene loci encoding for the vv proteins thymidine kinase or hemagglutinin serve as sites for the insertion of recombinant gene sequences there are several well-established techniques for clonal isolation of recombinant mva involving the coexpression of chromogenic agents eg escherichia coli -galactosidase and -glucuronidase or providing resistance against antimicrobials eg e coli xanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl-transferase for an overview see 2 4 recently methods relying on growth selection of recombinant mva have been developed these protocols take advantage of selective propagation in cell cultures that are non-permissive for non-recombinant mva in one protocol the vv host range gene k1l is transiently introduced into the mva genome and recombinant mva can subsequently be isolated in rabbit kidney rk-13 cells 4 5 after clonal isolation of the vector virus the k1l marker gene is again removed from the viral genome bearing the advantage that the same marker can be re-used subsequently to generate mva recombinant viruses harboring multiple gene insertions another recently developed host range selection technique relies on growth rescue of mutant mva in chicken embryo fibroblast cef cells 6 mva-e3l lacks the interferon resistance gene e3l and is unable to grow in cef stable re-insertion of the e3l gene together with a target gene sequence allows for quick isolation of mva recombinant viruses on cef in the 1970s highly attenuated mva was primarily considered to provide a means for safer vaccination against smallpox although there was knowledge about its avirulence and immunostimulating capacity from infection experiments in multiple animal models more systematic efforts to characterize the molecular basis of mva vaccine immunogenicity date from the more recent past important achievements include the characterization of the mva molecular life cycle upon infection of non-permissive mammalian cells the elucidation of the mva genome and our understanding that mva has lost relevant poxvirus immune evasion genes that target innate host responses based on cytokine and chemokine functions consequently defects in inhibitory virus genes are likely to be responsible for the mva-specific induction of host cytokine synthesis proposed decades ago for a review see 2 interestingly inactivation of the vv interferon resistance gene e3l in the mva genome resulted in enhanced production of type i interferon in cefs suggesting that the capacity of mva to stimulate innate responses may be further enhanced by rational mutagenesis 6 it can be assumed that such immunostimulation contributes to the particular immunogenicity of mva and might compensate for the advantage of live replication-competent vv in sustained antigen production in contrast to other viruses eg members of the herpesvirus family mva or replication-competent vv do not appear to specifically interfere with host cell antigen processing or presentation allowing for an apparently unimpaired induction of adaptive immune responses this assumption is in agreement with the finding that vv-specific humoral and cellular immunity can be detected decades after primary vaccination 7 when recently compared with conventional vv vaccines mva vaccines were found to elicit similar patterns of vv-specific immune responses that provided protection against experimental orthopoxvirus infections but required inoculation of higher dosage 8 9 10 11 remarkably earl and coworkers 11 demonstrated substantial protective capacity of mva vaccines in non-human primates against challenge with monkeypox virus thus making mva a valuable candidate as second-generation smallpox vaccine with more recombinant mva used for antigen delivery in clinical research 12 13 14 15 there is an increasing need to evaluate mva-specific immune responses following immunization although there are established means to monitor vaccine-induced antibodies cell-mediated immunity has scarcely been assessed 11 16 17 18 several approaches allow vv-induced t-cell immunity to be quantified without knowledge of defined vv-specific target antigens 19 20 21 in addition the use of recently identified human leukocyte antigen hla-a0201-restricted vv-specific cd8 t-cell epitopes 8 22 now makes it possible to compare epitope-specific responses elicited against vector or recombinant antigens figure 2
 i drexler and g sutter unpublished further knowledge as to how these responses might influence each other is highly relevant for developing optimal modes of mva vector immunization although replication-competent vv vaccines and other viral vectors are more likely to be hampered by antivector immunity than mva-based vectors 23 24 vaccinia-specific immune responses can be assumed to affect immunogenicity of the target antigen delivered by the mva vector vaccine yet pre-existing mva or vv immunity did not interfere with subsequent immunizations of recombinant mva expressing a cytomegalovirus cmv glycoprotein gb antigen 25 in addition a variety of methods has been derived to possibly circumvent the influence of vector-specific responses including the application of dna prime mva boost immunization 26 one particularly promising approach to enhance target antigen specific immune responses is based on combining different viral vector vaccines eg influenza 24 avipox 27 28 semliki forest 29 or vesicular stomatitis virus 30 non-viral vector vaccines eg dna- 31 32 or salmonella-based vaccines 33 or protein vaccines 34 with mva vaccines producing a common antigen these so-called prime-boost regimens can vary in dosage or in numbers and intervals of application 13 and can combine different application routes with various vector systems 35 depending on the kind of disease the type of immune response that needs to be induced by the test vaccine can also influence the formulation in the case of cancer human immunodeficiency virus hiv or malaria an immune response biased towards t helper 1 th1 cell immunity will be promoted using a combined dna and mva vaccination 36 much previous research has been dedicated to the development of mva candidate recombinant vaccines against multiple virus infections of humans including those causing aids influenza early childhood respiratory diseases measles japanese encephalitis or dengue fever for a review see 2 as an effective vaccine against aids is urgently needed recombinant mva producing immunodeficiency virus antigens are among the first vector viruses to be evaluated as candidate vaccines in humans 14 37 substantial data from studies in different simian immunodeficiency virus siv or simian human immunodeficiency virus shiv a chimera of siv and hiv infection models strongly support thorough clinical evaluation of mva-based vaccines the use of heterologous prime-boost strategies including mva vaccines and delivering multiple siv or hiv antigens proved successful to elicit antibody and high-level cytotoxic t-cell responses in macaques the immune response effectively controlled a mucosal challenge with shiv 896p and sivmac251-derived viruses or significantly reduced viral loads after challenge infection with neutralization-resistant and highly replication-competent sivmac239 30 38 39 40 41 42 importantly recent data suggest that sivhiv-specific mucosal immunity can be boosted by peripheral mva immunization after oral priming with a salmonella vector vaccine 33 and intranasal inoculation of recombinant mva can stimulate immunodeficiency virus-specific immunity in the genital or rectal tract 35 43 elicitation of potent mucosal immunity and induction of broadly virus-neutralizing antibody responses are important milestones still to be reached for the derivation of a successful hiv vaccine the principal capacity of mva to elicit highly effective virus-neutralizing antibody responses has been highlighted by the characterization of vector vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and human cmv 25 44 the successful engineering of mva expressing sars coronavirus spike protein also demonstrated the suitability of the vector system to readily respond to the potential threat of rapidly emerging infectious diseases a recently developed recombinant mva delivering multiple cmv antigens represents a promising candidate for the clinical testing of mva-based t-cell vaccines 25 45 46 this study also mirrors a general interest in the development of mva vector vaccines against human herpesvirus infections 47 48 the potential to activate robust cellular major histocompatibility complex mhc class i- and ii-restricted cd8 and cd4 t-cell responses against recombinant antigens has made mva vaccines attractive for immunotherapeutic approaches against cancer and selected intracellular parasitic or bacterial infectious diseases for experimental cancer therapy virus-associated malignancies seem to be predestined targets for mva vaccines taylor and co-workers 48 demonstrated the immunogenicity of an epstein-barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma vaccine by reactivating epstein-barr virus-specific cd8 and cd4 memory t cells in vitro recently corona gutierrez and colleagues 49 showed evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of an mva vaccine delivering human papillomavirus hpv e2 antigen against cervical cancer associated with hpv infection in a phase iii clinical trial vaccines based on recombinant mva expressing different tumor-associated antigens specific for a variety of cancers are currently being tested in mice 27 50 51 and humans 52 often these are combined with cytokines such as interleukin-2 52 costimulatory molecules such as b7-1 27 measures to circumvent immune inhibitory signalling by ctla-4 blockade 51 or cellular adjuvants like dendritic cells 15 to enhance immune responses against antigens that are likely to be tolerogenic self-proteins major efforts are underway to develop vaccines against malaria caused by plasmodium spp parasites preclinically heterologous prime-boost immunization regimens have elicited strong cd8 t-cell immunity and have shown substantial protection in mouse malaria challenge models against plasmodium berghei
28 or plasmodium yoelii
53 in addition safety and immunogenicity have been established in clinical trials with human volunteers experimentally 13 or naturally exposed to plasmodium falciparum
54 recently the first prime-boost vaccinations against tuberculosis  combining dna 55 or the classical bacille calmette-gurin vaccine 56 with recombinant mva expressing mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 85a  proved to be protective in mice recombinant mva is a prime candidate poxvirus vector for a generation of new vaccines against infections and tumors the portrait of the virus combines desirable elements such as high-level biological safety the ability to activate appropriate innate immune mediators upon vaccination and the capacity to deliver substantial amounts of heterologous antigens the adoption of up-to-date methodology for convenient vector generation vector quality control and vector vaccine immune monitoring has increased the pace of development bringing recombinant mva vaccines into clinical trials initial studies testing mva vaccines for prophylaxis or immunotherapy of aids malaria human papilloma virus-associated cancer or melanoma have already been completed table 1
 first results are overall very encouraging and confirm clinical safety importantly however they also demonstrate clinical efficacy despite the intrinsic difficulties associated with these target diseases renewed interest in the development of mva as candidate vaccine against an orthopoxvirus-related biothreat is likely to provide the basis for feasible large-scale manufacturing of mva vaccines indeed first studies suggest that mva would provide a suitable orthopox vaccine if necessary the use of recombinant mva to simultaneously provide immunity against smallpox has been proposed nevertheless one should keep in mind that hasty population-wide smallpox vaccinations might not be desirable as high level antivector immunity could limit the future potential of poxvirus-based vector vaccines more urgently needed for prophylaxis or therapy of uncontrolled infectious diseases cancer or emerging infections recent data from a phase i clinical trial for treatment of metastatic melanoma indicated that vaccination with mva-transduced dendritic cells can in vivo activate t-cell responses directed against the recombinant antigen tyrosinase and against the recently identified epitope within vaccinia virus envelope antigen h3 8 57 papers of particular interest published within the annual period of review have been highlighted as of special interest of outstanding interest
  the starting line for covid-19 vaccine development nelson lee allison mcgeer   developing a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine is a global priority to end this pandemic in their dose-escalation single-centre open-label phase 1 trial published in the lancet feng-cai zhu and colleagues1 report the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 ad5 vectored covid-19 vaccine which expresses the full length spike glycoprotein of the wuhan-hu-1 strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 108 healthy adults who had not been exposed to sars-cov-2 aged between 18 and 60 years mean age 363 years 49 female were sequentially enrolled to receive the low middle or high dose of the vaccine given as an intramuscular injection and observed for 28 days at around 14 days neutralising antibodies were detectable with live virus or pseudovirus neutralisation assays in addition to binding antibodies to receptor binding domain spike glycoprotein measured by elisa dose-dependent antibody responses peaked at 28 days with seroconversion four-fold increase in neutralising antibody titre documented in 5075 of participants in the middle and high dose groups further specific t-cell responses toward the spike glycoprotein were shown by interferon ifn  enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assessing cd4 and cd8 ifn tumour necrosis factor  interleukin-2 dose-dependent responses were detectable starting from 14 days in 8397 of participants the most commonly reported systemic adverse reactions were fever 50 46 fatigue 47 44 headache 42 39 and muscle pain 18 17 which were generally mild to moderate in severity although more frequent in the high dose group notably high pre-existing ad5 neutralising antibody titres 1200 in 4456 of participants were shown to compromise seroconversion and attenuate peak t-cell responses although vector-related febrile reactions were less frequent older participants 4560 years were found to have significantly lower humoral responses this is one of the first-in-human trials of a covid-19 vaccine candidate showing immunogenicity two key questions are whether responses are sustained over time and whether they correlate with clinical protection after exposure to a circulating strain of sars-cov-2 data from primate models suggest that measurable neutralising antibodies and specific t-cell responses could be associated with protection against virus challenge in vaccination or reinfection studies2 3 further research however is necessary to evaluate safety clinical efficacy and duration of protection a phase 2 study of this experimental vaccine middle or low dose has begun in china nct04341389 and canada has approved an early phase human trial nct04398147 other vaccine candidates are in rapid development they are mostly based on the spike glycoprotein or its receptor binding domain because of better immunogenic and protective potential but using different antigen delivery platforms eg recombinant protein or replicating or non-replicating viral-vector based vaccines and dna or mrna vaccines several are entering phase 1 clinical trials or pending results4 5 looking forward other than immunogenicity future trial design to establish efficacy will need to define the target groups eg health-care workers individuals at high risk of severe illness clinical endpoints eg reduction in virologically confirmed clinical illness hospitalisations deaths optimal duration of observation eg virus exposure side-effects antibody titre change and to anticipate antigenic change over time results of this study indicate that some host factors might affect vaccine response suboptimal immunogenicity was reported among older participants echoing the challenge seen with influenza vaccination further study in the older age group and the inclusion of individuals with underlying conditions are important as they are at risk of severe disease and might benefit most from vaccine prevention pre-existing immunity against the ad5 vector could compromise immunogenicity potentially limiting effectiveness in populations in which the virus is endemic the reported high seroprevalence around 3080 in many countries had posed substantial challenges in vector-based vaccine development for other infections eg ebola virus hiv6 7 8 whether using a rarer serotype or non-human primate adenovirus adjuvants booster or higher dose regimens or other delivery platforms eg replication-defective vaccinia could achieve greater degrees of immunogenicity is unknown and more research is needed4 5 6 another general concern is the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement eg non-neutralising antibodies fc -receptors and increased cellular immunopathology eg t-helper-2 or t-helper-17 cell in individuals who have been vaccinated if they are subsequently infected by a circulating sars-cov-2 strain as suggested in preclinical studies of sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccines with whole-length spike glycoprotein leading to research on a receptor binding domain-focused vaccine9 10 11 animal studies can be considered to assess the potential risk of sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates5 pre-existing non-spike-specific t-cell responses from endemic human coronavirus exposure eg oc43 nl63 that cross-react with sars-cov-2 could further add to the complexity in predicting vaccine response and safety12 13 these concerns will need to be addressed in future clinical studies with close monitoring and regulatory review amid these uncertainties this report of an immunogenic tolerable vaccine candidate is encouraging at the starting line for covid-19 vaccine development vaccine candidates shown to be efficacious will require substantial well directed and globally coordinated investments in production and delivery for their benefit to be realised 

  epitope-based vaccine target screening against highly pathogenic mers-cov an in silico approach applied to emerging infectious diseases jiandong shi jing zhang sijin li jing sun yumei teng meini wu jianfan li yanhan li ningzhu hu haixuan wang yunzhang hu ranjit ray   middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a newly emerging acute respiratory system infectious disease which is characterised by acute pneumonia respiratory failure and renal failure and caused by mers-coronavirus mers-cov 12 mers-cov was first isolated and identified in saudi arabia in 2012 as a new member in the lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus and is a zoonotic virus that is transmitted from bats to camels and then to humans 345 the genome of mers-cov is a non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded rna ssrna of approximately 30 kb encoding 11 proteins they include two replicase polyproteins open reading frames 1ab and 1a four structural proteins including spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins and five nonstructural proteins open reading frames 3 4a 4b 5 and 8b 6 mers-cov can be transmitted from person-to-person and has as high as 40 mortality 7 as of june 26 2015 a total of 1356 cases including 484 related deaths have been reported to the world health organization 8 no licensed vaccine or specific treatment is currently available as one of the most effective strategies to prevent virus infection vaccination is considered to be indispensable especially in the absence of effective treatment drugs the continuous increase of patients and a high mortality rate of mers-cov infection highlight the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines development the majority of recent progresses focused on the viral s glycoprotein and receptor-binding domain rbd of s protein 919 and showed that s protein-based or rbd-based subunit or vector vaccine that contain multiple neutralizing epitopes with high potentials to induce strong neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov infection thus it is considered to be a promising target for effective mers vaccine design 919 additionally almazan et al constructed a full-length infectious cdna clone of the mers-cov genome that lacked of e gene by reverse genetics approach to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates 20 theoretically nearly all viral proteins are potential immunogens and vaccine targets thus in addition to the s protein other viral proteins of the mers-cov might be effective immunogen targets of mers vaccine however few studies have analyzed or tested the possibility of other viral proteins of mers-cov as vaccine targets more importantly t-cell-based cellular immunity is essential for cleaning mers-cov infection yet the vaccine against the s protein mainly elicits neutralizing antibody response further the high mutation rate of the s protein may result in the escape of neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov therefore a highly conserved target that elicit both neutralizing antibody and cellular immunity against mers-cov is essential for an effective vaccine development epitopes are also known as the antigenic determinant which represents the minimal immunogenic region of a protein antigen and precisely elicit a specific immune responses 21 numerous studies show that epitope-based vaccines could effectively elicit protective immune responses against diverse pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus influenza virus hepatitis b virus and hepatitis c virus 2225 nevertheless for emerging highly pathogenic pathogens like mers-cov h5n1 and h7n9 although their genome sequences are available in genbank database their immunity associated with protection is currently largely unknown these gaps in understanding immune protection make developing vaccines against these highly pathogenic viruses more difficult and challenging 26 therefore an immunoinformatics-driven approach to thoroughly screen the dominant immunogens based on available genome sequences data of pathogens is essential and promising for effective vaccine design of emerging infectious diseases 26 in this study based on newly available genome sequence data of mers-cov numerous epitope vaccine candidates that could elicit protective humoral and cellular immune responses were obtained by immunoinformatics-driven vaccine target screening strategy these results provided new vaccine epitope candidates for mers vaccine development and indicated that immunoinformatic-driven immunogen screening is a promising strategy to accelerate vaccine development of the emerging highly pathogenic pathogens the entire viral proteome sequences of all mers-cov isolates that include structural proteins spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m nucleocapsid protein n and non-structural proteins orf3 orf4a orf4b orf5 and orf8b and two replicase polyproteins orf1ab and orf1a were retrieved from the national center for biotechnology information database httpwwwncbinlmnihgov and used as an input for various bioinformatics tools for antigenicity assessment secondary structure and 3d model prediction and epitope prediction these sequences come from different geographic regions such as saudi arabia england qatar spain germany jordan and korea with time ranges from 2012 to 2015 antigenicity refers to the ability of antigen that can be recognized by the immune system hence to find the best potential candidate antigen the vaxijen v20 server 27 httpwwwddg-pharmfacnetvaxijenvaxijenvaxijenhtml was used for analyzing whole protein antigenicity and determined the most potent antigenic protein the vaxijen is a web server that was developed by dr doytchinova ia and dr flower dr from faculty of pharmacy medical university of sofia for prediction of protective antigens tumor antigens and subunit vaccines with prediction accuracy of 70 to 89 for the discrimination between antigens and non-antigens 27 in this study virus was chosen as the target organism with default parameter a single antigenic protein with the highest antigenicity score was selected as vaccine candidate for further analysis antigenicity is closely related to the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein hence to determine the antigenicity and function of the target protein the secondary structure of target protein that included solvent accessibility transmembrane helices globular regions and coiled coil regions were predicted using the expasys secondary structure prediction server protparam 28 httpwebexpasyorgprotparam and a self-optimized prediction method for alignment sopma 29 httpsnpsa-prabiibcpfrcgi-binnpsaautomatplpagenpsanpsasopmahtml with default parameter protparam is a tool which allows the computation of various parameters including the molecular weight theoretical pi amino acid composition atomic composition extinction coefficient estimated half-life instability index aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity gravy for a given protein the sopma method correctly predicts 695 of the secondary structure -helix -sheet and coil 29 the raptorx web server 30 httpraptorxuchicagoedu was used to predict the three-dimensional 3d structure and binding residues of the chosen protein the method of kolaskar and tongaonkar 31 at the immune epitope database iedb httptoolsimmuneepitopeorgbcell was applied to predict linear b-cell epitopes the kolaskar and tongaonkar method has been applied to a large number of proteins to predict b-cell epitopes by the developers their results showed that the method can predict epitopes with about 75 accuracy hence it is better than most of the known methods 31 further the properties of the b-cell epitopes also include the flexibility surface accessibility and hydrophilicity hence they were predicted by the karplus and schulz flexibility prediction 32 and emini surface accessibility prediction 33 with a threshold of 10 respectively of the iedb conformational b-cell epitopes were predicted by ellipro httptoolsimmuneepitopeorgellipro 34 with the minimum score value set at 07 while the maximum distance selected as 6  the ellipro allows the prediction and visualization of b-cell epitopes in a given protein sequence or structure the test for ellipro on a benchmark dataset of discontinuous epitopes inferred from 3d structures of antibody-antigen complexes has shown the best performance compared with six other structure-based epitope prediction methods 34 the netmhciipan 30 server 35 httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesnetmhciipan was used to predict helper t-cell epitopes threshold for strong binding peptides ic50 was set at 50 nm to determine the binding and interaction potentials of helper t-cell epitope peptide and major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii allele the netmhciipan-30 is the first pan-specific helper t-cell epitope prediction method that covers all human leucocyte antigen hla class ii molecules including hla-dr hla-dp and hla-dq it can predict peptide binding to any hla class ii molecule in a specified protein sequence 34 the method was evaluated by the developers and shown a significant improvement over molecule-specific methods hence it is considered the most accurate mhc class ii predictor 36 here the top 10 epitopes with the maximum of binding hla-dr alleles were selected as putative epitope candidates the cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl epitope prediction was made using the iedb analysis resource netmhcpan version 28 tool 3738 and the consensus tool 39 which combines predictions from ann aka netmhc 34 4041 smm 42 and comblib 43 the netmhcpan is a high-throughput computational method for genome- and hla-wide prediction of peptide binding to hla class i molecules because it contains all hla class i alleles hence it can offer a truly global analysis for binding of the antigenetic peptide and hla molecule and promote rational vaccine design 37 the netmhc is a prediction method with an average of 7580 accuracy for peptides binding to hla class i molecules it has been employed widely to predict hla-binding peptides in proteomes of various pathogens including sars influenza and hiv 41 the percentile rank threshold was set at 05 in this study the top 10 epitopes with the maximum of binding hla-a alleles were selected as putative epitope vaccine candidates further except for a strong binding affinity the peptides with strong immunogenicity are more likely to be ctl epitopes than those with weak immunogenicity hence the iedb immunogenicity prediction tool httptoolsimmuneepitopeorgimmunogenicity was used to predict the immunogenicity of the candidate epitopes 44 this tool predicts immunogenicity of a peptide-hla phla complex based on the amino acid properties and their positions in the defined peptide the epitope conservancy analysis tool httptoolsimmuneepitopeorgtoolsconservancyiedbinput at the iedb was applied for the epitope conservancy analysis 45 the conservancy levels were obtained by searching for identities in the given protein sequence this tool calculates the degree of conservancy of an epitope within a given protein sequence set at different degrees of sequence identity the degree of conservancy is defined as the fraction of protein sequences containing the epitope at a given identity level the allergenicity of the epitopes was analyzed by the allerhunter server 46 httptigerdbsnusedusgallerhunter allerhunter is a svm-pairwise system for assessment of allergenicity and allergic cross-reactivity in proteins it aims to predict allergens and non-allergens with high sensitivity and specificity without compromising efficiency at classification of proteins with similar sequences to known allergens 46 due to the mhc restriction of t cell response the peptides with more different hla binding specificities mean more population coverage in defined geographical regions where the peptide-based vaccine might be employed the population coverage rate of individual epitope was calculated using the iedb population coverage tool httptoolsimmuneepitopeorgtoolspopulationiedbinput 47 every epitope and its binding hla alleles were added and different geographic areas were also selected the selection of immunogen is the first step for vaccine design hence to obtain the most probable antigenic protein the whole viral proteomes of all mers-cov isolates were retrieved and screened a total of 99 mers-cov variants from different geographical regions with their entire proteomes were obtained s1 table the antigenicity of each protein is indicated by the overall score produced by the specific protein sequence using the vaxijen server on the whole the scores of the n protein and orf8b protein of mers-cov were higher than the s e m orf3 orf4a orf4b orf5 orf1ab and orf1a proteins moreover the orf8b protein with its genbank id ail239971 and the n protein with its genbank id agv084991 possessed the significantly highest antigenic scores of 08218 and 07749 respectively among all the query proteins s1 table however the orf8b protein would be rapidly degraded by proteasomes in the absence of the orf8a protein an accessory protein of orf8b 48 thus it was not an ideal antigen candidate although its high antigenic score in this study the n protein was chosen as a candidate immunogen and model protein to carry out epitope-based vaccine design further the most probable antigenic protein was analyzed for its secondary structural characteristics and the properties that included total length of 413 aa molecular weight of 450482 da theoretical pi of 1005 formula of c1965h3102n594o611s7 70 alpha helixes 66 extended strands 32 beta turns and 245 random coils are obtained and shown in table 1 and fig 1 the grand average of the hydrophobicity rule gravy of the n protein linear sequence was predicted to be negative -0865 this indicated the property of the protein as hydrophilic in nature and most of the residues to be present on the surface this means that more amino acids tend to be binding residues when interacted with other proteins the 3d structure showed a maximum of 64 identity of the n protein of mers-cov with the best template protein pdb 2ofza rna binding domain of sars nucleocapsid protein and it is composed of two separate domains or pockets fig 2 protein binding site prediction showed that a total of 12 binding residues including t40 v41 s42 y44 t45 g46 r97 y99 y101 r138 a145 and s173 were mapped on the domain-1 and only 2 binding residues including g267 and l268 were mapped on the domain-2 obviously the domain-1 possessed the greater ability to interact with other proteins than the domain-2 this might be associated with distribution of the conformational epitopes on the n protein of mers-cov one of the key steps in epitope-driven vaccine design is the prediction and identification of the b-cell epitopes in target antigens thus to obtain b-cell epitope candidates in the n protein of mers-cov in silico identification of b-cell epitopes based on the iedb database was performed based on the kolaskar and tongaonkars method of the iedb a total of 15 linear b-cell epitopes of the n protein of mers-cov were identified the length of the epitopes ranged from 6 to 20 amino acids these epitopes had 7891 conservancy level among the specified n protein sequences notably the epitopes 4paapravsf12 and 324npvyflrysgaikl337 were allergic to human hence they could not be vaccine candidates epitopes length sequences location conservancy and allergenicity are shown in table 2 further the results showed that the average antigenic prospensity value of the predicted epitopes was 0993 with a minimum of 0863 and a maximum of 1182 s1 fig since surface accessibility and fragment flexibility are also key features for predicting b-cell epitopes thus the surface accessibility and flexibility were analyzed based on methods of the iedb results of the analysis of the surface accessibility of the predicted peptides showed that the maximum surface probability value was 6971 at amino acid position from 363 to 368 the sequence of the hexapeptide is 363kkekkq368 where 365e is the surface residue the minimum value of surface probability is 0074 for peptides 205gigavg210 where 207g is the surface residue s2 fig likewise results of the analysis of the flexibility of the predicted peptides showed that the maximum flexibility value was 1160 at amino acid position from 170 to 176 and its sequence is 167gnsqsss173 where 170q is the flexible residue the minimum value of flexibility probability is 0903 for peptides 97rwyfyyt103 where 100f is the flexibility residue s3 fig in addition a total of 10 conformational b-cell epitopes having a protrusion index pi score value above 07 were obtained by the ellipro the highest probability of a conformational epitope was calculated at 979 pi score 0979 and shown in fig 3a residues involved in conformational epitopes their location number of residues and scores are shown in table 3 whereas their positions on 3d structures are shown in fig 3a to 3j since mhc-ii restricted cd4 t-cells activation is important for inducing and maintaining an efficient antibody response or ctl response hence the helper t-cell epitopes in the n protein of mers-cov were in silico identified as a result a total of 71 antigenic peptides with 9-mer core sequences in the n protein of mers-cov were identified to be helper t-cell epitopes using the netmhciipan 30 server s2 table they can bind a different large number of hla-dr alleles with an ic50 value less than 50nm which indicated a very high binding affinity to hla-dr molecules based on the fact that a good t-cell epitope should interact with as many hla alleles as possible the top 10 epitopes with the highest number of binding hla-dr alleles were selected as putative helper t-cell epitope candidates table 4 all of the 10 putative helper t-cell epitopes with numerous binding hla-dr alleles tend to be good epitope candidates among them the epitope 329lrysgaikl337 interacting with 357 hla-dr alleles was the epitope possessing the maximum number of binding hla-dr alleles on the contrary 230vkqsqpkvi238 interacting with 94 hla-dr alleles is the epitope possessing the minimum number of binding hla-dr alleles further all selected putative epitopes were highly conserved with 8991 conversancy level and no epitope was found allergic to humans details of predicted putative helper t-cell epitopes along with their respective binding hla-dr alleles are shown in s2 table as we all know mhc-i restricted cd8 cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls plays a crucial role in controlling virus infection hence identification of ctl epitopes is vital for understanding the principles of t cell activation and epitope-driven vaccine design herein a total of 34 immunogenic peptides with 9-mer sequences in the n protein of mers-cov were identified to be ctl epitopes using the mhc-i binding predictions of the iedb with recommended methods s3 table they can bind a different large number of hla-a alleles with a very high binding affinity top 10 epitopes binding the most hla-a alleles were selected as putative ctl epitope candidates based on their more broad hla coverage table 5 among them the epitope 92kqlaprwyf100 had the highest number of binding hla-a alleles 138 alleles followed by 343nynkwlell351 128 alleles yet the epitopes 72aqnagywrr80 37 alleles and 387rvqgsitqr395 31 alleles had the minimum number of binding hla-a alleles most ctl epitope candidates with a positive score of immunogenicity showed a high potential to elicit strong ctl response further these ctl epitope candidates were highly conserved with 8591 conservancy level among available n protein sequences of mers-cov isolates and no epitope was found allergic to humans details of predicted putative ctl epitopes along with their respective binding hla-a alleles are shown in s3 table hla distribution varies among different ethnic groups and geographic regions around the world thus population coverage must be taken into account when designing an effective vaccine to cover as much as possible populations in this study all indicated alleles in supplementary data were identified as optimum binders with the predicted epitopes and were used to determine the population coverage for these epitopes the high population coverage was found for all putative helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes in 15 specified geographic regions of the world table 6 for helper t-cell epitopes an excellent percentage of cumulative population coverage of the 10 epitopes was obtained in south asia 9868 closely followed by central africa 9851 southeast asia 9817 west africa 9810 east africa 9775 southwest asia 9745 oceania 9678 west indies 9657 northeast asia 9620 europe 9577 north africa 9505 north america 9481 east asia 9389 and south america 8718 and the lowest was in south africa 6218 these results indicated most geographic regions of the world where more than 90 of their population can be covered by all putative helper t-cell epitopes for ctl epitopes a moderate and acceptable percentage of cumulative population coverage of the 10 epitopes was obtained in central africa 5949 followed by east asia 5014 oceania 4885 southwest asia 4821 south asia 4721 east africa 4251 southeast asia 4201 west africa 4186 south africa 3895 north america 3503 north africa 3302 south america 3271 northeast asia 3247 and west indies 3008 and the lowest was in europe 2062 these results indicated only partial regions of the world such as central africa and east asia where approximately half of the population can be covered by all putative ctl epitopes overall these results suggested that putative helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes can specifically bind with the prevalent hla molecules in the target population where the vaccine will be employed emerging infectious pathogens such as mers-cov h5n1 and h7n9 are highly pathogenic for humans for these pathogens immunity associated with protection remain largely unknown gaps in understanding the protective immunity against these pathogens make developing vaccines for newly emerging infectious diseases more difficult and challenging 26 thus the genome-wide screening of vaccine targets based on newly available genome sequences data of pathogens is essential and urgent for developing efficiently vaccines against these newly emerging highly pathogenic pathogens this study aim to screen and investigate the most antigenic protein of the mers-cov and to find out the b- and t-cell epitopes that were mapped on the most antigenic protein by using a strategy namely genome-wide screening of vaccine epitopes based on advances in bioinformatics the immunoinformatics approach could be an effective and essential strategy for vaccine development of emerging highly pathogenic pathogens in this study an immunoinformatics-driven approach was used to screen vital dominant immunogens against mers-cov the results showed that the n protein was a better antigenic protein with the highest antigenic scores compared with other viral proteins in entire viral proteome however nearly all current studies of mers vaccine focused on the s protein of mers-cov 919 because the s protein mediated recognition of host cell dpp4 receptor for mres-cov and induced significant immune response 49 in fact not just the s protein other mers-cov viral proteins might be effective mers vaccine candidates however few studies have emphasized this possibility further t-cell-based cellular immunity is essential for cleaning mers-cov infection yet the vaccine against the s protein mainly elicit neutralizing antibody response more importantly high mutation rate of the s protein of mers-cov may cause escape of neutralizing antibodies against s protein therefore an ideal target should be highly conserved that elicit both neutralizing antibody and cellular immunity against mers-cov which is more essential for an effective mers vaccine development the n protein of human cov is abundantly produced during infection and exhibits strong immunogenicity and conservancy which can act as an ideal immunogen to elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses 50 it is noteworthy that a large number of previous studies have shown the feasibility of the n protein as an immune target antigen or vaccine product 5160 ma et al demonstrated that a sars-cov vaccine based on the n gene that was expressed by dna plasmid and adenovirus vector could induce detectable antibody and ifn- 51 similar studies of the dna vaccine based on the sars-cov n gene have shown potential inducing specific humoral and cellular immunity in balbc mice 5253 moreover multiple immunodominant b-cell epitopes helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes were mapped on the n protein of sars-cov 5458 additionally the antigenicity of the n protein from other viruses has been demonstrated 5960 and the antibodies against the n proteins of diverse human covs have been revealed by gao et al 61 based on these findings it concludes that the n protein of mers-cov might be a putative and valuable immunogen for vaccine development further the screened epitopes from the n protein in this study also may be some valuable epitope-based vaccine candidates for further in vitro and in vivo tests for their antigenic and immunogenetic potentials the purpose of vaccination is to induce immunity against specific pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen-specific b-cells or ctls and helper t-cells theoretically a vaccine should contain two classes of antigenic epitopes a helper t-cell epitope and a b-cell epitope or a ctl epitope based on a combination of these epitopes the vaccine is able to either induce specific humoral or cellular immune against specific pathogens 21 therefore the b-cell ctl and helper t-cell epitopes were screened systemically in the n protein of mers-cov to obtain putative epitope vaccine candidates in this study one b-cell epitope 108eaalpfravkdgivwvhed126 showed a lower conservancy of 78 among different mers-cov isolates compared with other 14 epitopes suggesting that it might be not an idea epitope candidate based on the fact that an epitope should be as conservative as possible to provide broader protection among different virus strains in addition various continuous and discontinuous b-cell epitopes were mapped on the n protein table 2 and fig 3 all discontinuous b-cell epitopes were located on the surface of the domain-2 of the n protein showing the accessibility for the entered virus moreover the diverse t-cell epitopes including helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes were delineated by dissecting the n proteins tables 4 and 5 notably neutralizing antibodies are not far enough to completely clean infectious pathogens ctls are needed because they play a central role in the generation of a protective immune response against diverse pathogen infection 62 in this study although the ctl epitope 93qlaprwyfy101 showed the highest immunogenic score of 032573 it possessed the minimal hla binding alleles among all predicted ctl epitopes on the contrary the epitope 92kqlaprwyf100 had the maximum hla binding alleles but less immunogenic score of 025847 this inconsistency of immunological characteristics among different epitopes suggested that various parameters needed to be considered when screened epitopes helper t-cell epitopes are critical to the generation of vigorous humoral and ctl responses however the response to t-cell epitopes is restricted by hla proteins moreover hla is highly polymorphic in diverse ethnic populations therefore to induce broad immune responses in diverse ethnic genetically diverse human populations the hla specificity of t-cell epitopes must be considered first as a major criteria for screening of the epitopes 6364 based on the above analysis to get more population coverage the epitope candidates should bind more hla alleles in this study the 10 ten helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes that bind the maximum number of hla alleles were selected as putative vaccine candidates further analysis revealed that all putative helper t-cell and ctl epitopes have an ideal population coverage and may provide broad immune protection for different geographic regions around the world additionally as an ideal epitope it should be highly conserved among different mers-cov isolates thus conservancy level should be determined for all putative epitope candidates the epitopes from this study were highly conserved in designated mers-cov isolates suggesting that they could be ideal epitope vaccine candidates to elicit protective neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses against mers-cov in conclusion this study indicated that immunoinformatics-driven genome-wide screening of vaccine targets of emerging highly pathogenic pathogens is a promising strategy to accelerate their vaccine development based on this strategy the b-cell epitopes helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes in the n protein of mers-cov were mapped and selected as putative mers vaccine candidates however the b-and t-cell stimulation potentials of the screened epitopes are needed to be tested by in vitro and in vivo experiments along with this in silico study for their efficient use as vaccines against mers-cov the present study provides new and valuable epitope candidates and prompts the future vaccine

in 2012 1 soon after its first report some imported cases occurred in many other countries outside the arabian peninsula through infected travelers most notably the outbreak in south korea in 2015 2 the clinical signs of mers-cov-infected patients are similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the outbreaks of which in china in 2003 caused acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans 3 bats and dromedaries are considered as the natural reservoirs of mers-cov 3 up to now a continuous increase of human cases in the endemic areas has been reported 4 highlighting that it is urgent to develop and make available effective therapeutic drugs and prophylactic vaccines to protect against mers-cov to date many promising approaches toward mers-cov vaccine candidates have been developed such as recombinant viral vectors 45678910 protein-based platforms 1112 bacterial-based platform 13 and dna vaccines 141516 most of mers-cov vaccine candidates have focused on the major immune-dominant antigen the s protein of the virion which plays a significant role in mediating viral entry into target cells and in inducing neutralizing antibodies in experimental animals and infected individuals 17 the receptor-binding domain rbd within the s1 domain of the s protein of the mers-cov virus decides the host range and cellular tropism 181920 as such we developed two promising mers-cov vaccine candidates using two different platforms one uses the rabies virus rv as a vector to express s1 domains of the mers-cov s gene to develop a recombinant mers-cov vaccine and the other applies gram-positive enhancer matrix gem particles as a vector to construct a mers bacterium lactococcus lactis-like particle blp vaccine by displaying the rbd 13 a previous study has utilized the rv bnsp333 vector modified from the rv vaccine vector spbn to successfully design a vaccine against mers-cov infection 1021 whereas the rv vector srv9 strain used in our study is screened from the street alabama dufferin sad strain by plaque purification on baby syrian hamster kidney cells bhk-21 cells which have been proven to be safe and have good immunogenicity 22 the gem-pa system is a novel surface display system consisting of nonliving and genetically unmodified gem particles and a protein anchor pa from the lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan hydrolase acma we utilized the system to successfully display the rbd protein fragment of mers-cov inducing high neutralizing antibodies with intramuscular vaccination and robust antigen-specific local and systemic immune responses by intranasal vaccination 13 the head-to-head comparison of available vaccine vectors is necessary in vaccine design 23 the difference in immune response induced by two different mers-cov vaccine candidates and the effect of antigen displayed in viral and bacterial vectors on the immune response are still questionable in this study we evaluated the immunological efficacy of mers blp at different doses and the inactivated recombinant mers antigen in bablc mice specifically we compared the ability of these two vaccines to induce mers-cov-specific humoral immune response and t-cell-mediated immune response as well as neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov all animal works were strictly in accordance with the welfare and ethical guidance on chinese laboratory animals gb

six-week-old female balbc mice were purchased from changchun yisi laboratory animal technology co ltd changchun china female balbc mice were randomized into five groups of 10 mice were intramuscularly prime-immunized with 8 g purified rvmers virus 1 5 and 20 g mers blp mixed with the compound adjuvants consisting of isa201vg seppic paris france and poly i c sigma st louis mo usa and boosted twice with an equal volume antigen as the primary vaccination at 3-week intervals compound adjuvants only were immunized as negative control blood samples were collected before immunization and two weeks after each vaccination serum samples were inactivated at 56 c for 30 min before determining mers-cov rbd-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies five mice selected randomly from each group were euthanized on day 7 after the third immunization and their splenocytes were collected for cytokines analysis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa was applied to analyze mers-cov rbd-specific igg igg1 igg2a igg2b igg2c and igg3 antibodies serially diluted sera were added to 96-well microtiter plates corning-costar corning ny usa that were pre-coated overnight with mers-rbd protein 1 gml

were detected by using a mers-cov pseudovirus reported in our previous study 11 briefly serially diluted mouse sera mixed with an equal volume of 100 tcid50 of mers-pseudotyped viruses were incubated at 37 c for 30 min and then the mixture was incubated with huh 7 cells at 37 c for 4 h after the incubation the medium was replaced with complete dmem containing 10 fetal bovine serum and 1 penicillinstreptomycin and then the samples were incubated at 37 c for 48 h the luciferase activity was detected by using an infinite m200 microplate spectrophotometer tecan mnnedorf switzerland to evaluate antigen-specific t-cell responses splenocytes were harvested on day 7 after the third immunization and stimulated with 1 m mers-cov peptide s291 for 24 h at 37 c 25 secreted tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- interferon-gamma ifn- and interleukin 2 il-2 in the supernatants were detected with the mouse elisa cytokine kits mabtech nacka sweden all statistical analysis was performed by using the graphpad 802 software the results are expressed as the mean  sd and significance in their differences between groups were analyzed using a students t-test the particle size and polydispersity index of rvmers and mers blp were measured by a dynamic light scattering dls device before immunization of mice as shown in figure 1 the size of rvmers is about 167 nm figure 1a the size of mers blp is about 2161 nm figure 1b to compare the immunological efficacy of two mers-cov vaccines derived from two different vectors we studied the impact on the immunogenicity of mers-cov blp with different doses and the immunogenicity of rvmers with only one certain dose in mice the schematic diagram for group design immunizations and immunological characterization is shown in figure 2a a total of five groups of mice g1g5 were administered three immunizations with a combined adjuvant through an intramuscular im route g1 was immunized with pbs as negative control g2 was immunized with 8 g inactivated and purified rvmers g3g5 were immunized with 1 g low dose 5 g medium dose and 20 g high dose mers-cov blp respectively sequential sera samples were collected at weeks 0 2 5 and 8 and detected for neutralizing activity against pseudotyped mers-cov and the binding activity splenocytes were harvested at 7 weeks after the last immunization for cytokines analysis as shown in figure 2b g2 developed neutralizing antibody response at 2 weeks after the first immunization and the neutralizing antibodies of g3 g4 and g5 were not detected at this point however the neutralizing antibody of g3 g4 and g5 was significantly higher than g2 at 5 and 8 weeks after immunization there were also no significant differences in the neutralizing activity among g3 g4 and g5 indicating that 1 g mers-cov blp can efficiently induce mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in mice overall these results show that the rvmers can rapidly induce neutralizing antibody response and the mers blp can induce higher antibody response in mice we next detected the mers-cov rbd-specific igg and igg subtypes antibodies level in the serum at 8 weeks post-immunization elisa results indicate that both mers antigen-induced igg antibodies can specifically bind to mers-cov rbd protein particularly g3g5 acquired a stronger binding to mers-cov rbd protein than g2 whereas g1 the control samples were detected to have negligible binding activity figure 3a indicating the specificity of the igg antibody response induced by this rbd protein additionally the endpoint titers of the igg antibody level showed that the immunogenicity of g3g5 was much stronger than g2 in inducing mers-cov rbd-specific igg antibody response in mice after three vaccinations figure 3b furthermore no significant difference was shown for igg titers among groups g3 g4 and g5 suggesting that 1 g antigen protein on the bacterial vector is sufficient to induce high rbd-specific antibody level in mice thus the mers-cov antigen protein displayed on the surface of the bacterial vector can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of the rbd fragments t helper 2 th2 response is associated with igg1 and t helper 1 th1 response correlates with igg2a igg2b igg2c and igg3 in mice 26 in order to evaluate the igg subtypes levels in serum from immunized mice the production of igg1 igg2a igg2b igg2c and igg3 in sera were detected observation of sera igg subtypes showed that the sera in g3g5 induced significantly higher levels of igg1 antibody than those of g2 figure 4a the sera in g4g5 induced significantly higher levels of igg2a and igg2b antibodies than those of g2 figure 4bc there was no significant difference in igg2c antibody level between g2g5 figure 4d the sera in g5 induced significantly higher levels of igg3 antibody than those of g2 figure 4e however further analysis of the ratios of igg2aigg1 revealed that the sera in g2 were remarkably higher than those in g3g5 figure 4f collectively these results suggest that the mers-cov antigen protein displayed on the surface of the viral vector appears to induce a stronger th1-biased immune response than that on the bacterial vector next in order to analyze the mers-cov specific t-cell immune responses we detected the levels of secreted ifn- il-2 and tnf- from the splenocytes after re-stimulation with mers s291 peptide the levels of ifn- and il-2 in g3 were significantly higher than those in g4 and g5 suggesting that 1 g of antigen protein on the bacterial vector is sufficient to induce potent ifn-il-2-expressing t-cell responses whereas the levels of ifn- il-2 and tnf- in g2 were remarkably higher than those in g3g5 at 7 weeks post-immunization wpi figure 5 these results indicate that mers-cov antigen protein displayed on the viral vector induces a superior cellular immune response than that on the bacterial vector mers-cov continues to infect humans causing morbidity and mortality since several outbreaks in 2012 that have caused a potential global mers-cov pandemic however no prophylactics and therapeutics available to protect against mers have currently been licensed although researchers have developed and tested several mers-cov vaccine candidates in many animal models each of these candidate vaccines has several advantages and challenges such as preexisting immunity immunogenicity and cost-effectiveness here we have developed two promising mers-cov vaccine candidates using two different platforms one is the recombinant rv expressing mers-cov s1 protein fragment and the other uses gem particles as a vector to display the mers-cov rbd protein fragment in this study we compared the humoral and cellular responses in a balbc mouse model the results indicate that the rvmers vaccine induces rapidly neutralizing antibody and stronger t-cell immune responses than the mers-cov blp vaccine however the mers-cov blp vaccine can induce a higher level of neutralizing antibodies than that of the rvmers vaccine two unique aspects can be highlighted in our study the first is about the rv vector besides the mers-cov which has been proven to be successfully utilized for many other emergent infectious diseases such as the ebola virus ebov 27 lassa virus lasv 28 marburg virus marv 29 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 30 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv 31 additionally the ebola virus vaccine is close to clinical trials 29 notably chemically inactivated rabies virus vaccines have been widely used for vaccination of humans dogs cats and ferrets which shows that they are safe for humans and animals 32 therefore the inactivated rabies virus-based vaccine is also safe and can induce neutralizing antibodies against the target pathogen here the results show that the inactivated rabies virus vectors have very safe and immunogenic profiles in animals and highlight their promise for vaccine development the second unique aspect of this study is the gem-pa system a novel surface display system which is a flexible effective cost-effective and easy-to-handle alternative for heterologous proteins to be displayed on the gem particles 33 the gem particles are from the lactococcus lactis boiled in acids and mainly contain the bacterial-shaped peptidoglycan spheres lacking other cell components 34 additionally lactococcus lactis has been safely applied in foods in recent years 35 as such the gem-based vaccine is recognized as being safe furthermore the gem particles have been proven to enhance immune response as a carrier displaying the antigen with high density or adjuvant in vaccine development 36373839 gem particles can also improve the humoral and cellular immune response by activating the maturation of the dendritic cells enhancing the antigen-presenting capacity and stimulating the dcs to produce cytokines 40 besides that peptidoglycan the main component of the gem particles is a toll-like receptor tlr 2 ligand 384041 moreover gem particles can efficiently bind the antigen protein at room temperature to obtain the purified proteins with only a one-step centrifugation process 33 it is convenient and economical to scale up in vaccine development gem particles can also bind to different antigen proteins in the same particles to develop multivalent vaccines 42 the system has successfully displayed a variety of heterologous proteins from pathogens showing strong antigen-specific immune responses with parenteral vaccination or mucosal vaccination including viruses bacteria and parasites 3843444546 in our study the results suggest that the rbd protein of mers-cov displayed on the gem particles could induce strong humoral and cellular immune response even when the dose is as low as 1 g the two vaccine platforms in this study have their own advantages and disadvantages the rv-based mers-cov vaccine platform can rapidly induce antibody immune response and higher cellular immune response than the gem-based vaccine platform however there is a risk of incomplete inactivation in the process of inactivating the rvmers additionally rvmers vaccine needs to be purified through many purification steps these factors must be considered in vaccine production antigen protein density and distribution on a particle are two key parameters in eliciting an efficient immune response in vaccine design a high density and ordered antigenic array displayed on a particle makes binding events between the host b-cell surface immunoglobulins and the particle occur more easily which is an important step in inducing sequential immune response 47 the gem-based vaccine platform could display antigen protein in a high density while the rv-based vaccine platform not only displayed the antigen protein but also expressed the rv gp protein this may be why the gem-based vaccine of mers-cov induces a much stronger humoral immune response in mice than that of the rv-based vaccine micro-particles could promote a humoral immune response and nano-particles are much easier to induce a cellular immune response 4849 the size of the rvmers virion is about 167 nm and the diameter of the mers blp particles is about 2161 nm this may be a critical factor in inducing a different cellular immune response by two different vectors of vaccine platforms specific molecules of microbial origin as intrinsic innate immune triggers are endowed with adjuvant activity such as lipopolysaccharide lps bacterial lipopeptides deoxyribonucleic acid dna ribonucleic acid rna and other conserved molecules 50 the receptors for these molecules are the mammalian toll-like receptors tlrs members of the tlrs have been confirmed on the cell surface membrane tlr1245610 and on the membrane of endosomes tlr3789 51 peptidoglycan the main component of the gem particles is a tlr 2 ligand which is an activation of tlr-2 receptors in human peripheralblood mononuclear cells inducing a th1-type immune response 52 single stranded rna the component of inactivated rabies virus is a tlr 7 ligand 5153 tlr78 agonists have shown th1 polarizing effects on the immune response different receptors play an important role in delivering different signals to the host cells the activated antigen presenting cells apcs precisely define the nature of the perceived danger and send this information to the secondary lymphoid organs inducing relevant adaptive immune response this may be another ignored factor of inducing a different immune response by the immune system thinking that the danger is from a virus infection or a bacterial infection the immune system is triggered by a combination of events and stimuli in vaccine immunology the compound adjuvants containing the emulsion and polyic tlr 3 ligand may be another assignable cause the speed of the antibodies production and cellular immune response needs to be further improved in future study of the gem-based vaccine platform to solve the problems we can try to screen optimum adjuvants for the vaccine or co-displaying protein-adjuvants on gem particles such as flagellin tlr 5 ligand furthermore the gem-based vaccine platform may be more suitable to develop mucosal vaccines considering that lactococcus lactis has been safely used as a probiotic in our foods understanding the modes of action of the gem-based vaccine platform will allow us to design a much safer cost-effective and protective vaccine with the desired immune response the goal of this study was to test vaccine vectors through a head-to-head comparison of immunogenicity of two mers-cov vaccine candidates as they might be used in real vaccines for humans or animals this study provides an important reference for selecting a suitable vaccine platform in developing the mers-cov vaccine or other special pathogens

respiratory illness under active surveillance by who and in 2015 it was placed on the list of priority diseases with high epidemic potential that warrant urgent research and development of countermeasures1 as a disease of the lower respiratory tract in humans mers can progress rapidly from unspecific influenza-like symptoms to severe pneumonia multiple organ failure and death the causative agent of mers is mers coronavirus mers-cov which was first identified in 2012 in saudi arabia2 dromedary camels serve as reservoir hosts and the majority of primary human cases can be traced back to close or frequent contact with dromedaries additionally human-to-human transmission is amplified in health-care settings adding health-care workers to the populations at high risk as of jan 31 2020 2519 cases have been reported with 866 deaths in 27 countries resulting in a case-fatality rate of 3433 large mers outbreaks occurred in saudi arabia in 2014 255 cases and 93 deaths4 and in south korea in 2015 186 cases and 38 deaths5 although transmission is predominantly reported from the arabian peninsula there is a high risk of exporting cases to areas outside the middle east as a result of travel so far supportive therapy isolation of patients and contact tracing remain the main pillars of mers treatment and prevention highlighting the urgent need to develop countermeasures such as vaccines to block transmission and combat potential future disease outbreaks the development of mers vaccine candidates has been challenging because the determinants of protective immunity remain incompletely understood and the limited number of mers cases has made it difficult to do efficacy trials although optimal animal models for the identification of protective immune correlates for mers are still scarce current mouse models suggest a crucial role for antibodies and t cells in the induction of protective immunity6 7 8 in humans one study showed a positive correlation of cd4 t-cell responses and neutralising antibodies with severe disease progression and a positive correlation of strong virus-specific cd8 t-cell responses with reduced morbidity9 conversely another study reported a positive association between early cd8 t-cell responses and disease severity in acute mers-cov infection10 a role of antibodies in protection was shown in mice that received convalescent sera from survivors9 the animal and human data underline that a mers vaccine candidate should preferentially induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and that the timing and dose of a vaccine could be crucial for protection in this study we used the recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara rmva vaccine vector platform which has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans11 mva vaccine candidates have demonstrated a favourable safety profile in various populations and disease settings11 12 13 the mers-cov spike glycoprotein consists of s1 and s2 subunits and mediates viral attachment to host cells entry and membrane fusion14 it is a target for neutralising antibodies and therefore vaccine development the mers vaccine candidate mva-mers-s investigated in this study encodes the full mers-cov spike glycoprotein preclinical studies have shown that mva-mers-s induced neutralising antibodies6 and conferred protection against mers-cov in mice15 expressing the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 receptor furthermore a reduction in viral replication in a mers-cov challenge after mva-mers-s vaccination was successfully demonstrated in dromedary camels16 these preclinical data support the advancement of the vaccine candidate mva-mers-s to test the safety and immunogenicity in human clinical trials we aimed to assess the safety tolerability and immunogenicity data for a novel viral-vectored mers candidate vaccine in healthy adults this open-label phase 1 study was done at the university medical center hamburg-eppendorf hamburg germany

after vaccination occurrence of unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after vaccination change from baseline of safety laboratory measures and occurrence of serious adverse events throughout the study period of 6 months the secondary endpoint of immunogenicity was the magnitude of mers-cov spike-specific antibody responses as measured by elisa preplanned exploratory analyses included evaluation of t-cell immunity by elispot this trial was designed as an exploratory trial and was not powered statistically to measure a specific outcome or determine dose finding all participants who

enrolled figure 1
 details of the participants baseline characteristics are summarised in the table 1
 three individuals one in the low-dose group and two in the high-dose group did not receive the booster immunisation and were excluded from the immunogenicity analysis however all data were included in the safety investigations the two participants in the low-dose group discontinued because of personal reasons within the first 14 days of study and were replaced both replacements completed the follow-up visits a third person high-dose group who dropped out received no booster immunisation because of an unrelated urinary tract infection on day 27 this person was not replaced at this stage of the trial the full primeboost vaccination regimen was administered to 23 participants at an interval of 28 days all 23 participants completed the scheduled follow-up visits up to 6 months one participant from the low-dose group moved the day 180 follow-up visit to day 110 because of a change of residence this timepoint was excluded from the immunogenicity analysis there were no other protocol violations in the monitoring of acute reactogenicity following immunisations no serious adverse events were reported 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten 71 of 14 participants in the low-dose group and 111 were reported in ten 83 of 12 participants in the high-dose group the majority was solicited and mild with a few moderate and no severe adverse events most adverse events appeared early after administration of the vaccine median 1 day iqr 13 the high-dose group had more adverse events after prime and boost immunisations than the low-dose group figure 2a

 antibody responses were predominantly detected after the second vaccine dose of either the low or the high dose of mva-mers-s two vaccinated participants one from the low-dose group and one from the high-dose group showed a positive elisa response on day 28 after a single mva-mers-s administration 7 days after boost immunisation day 35 mers-cov s1-specific antibodies were detectable in both dose groups table 3 the majority of vaccinated participants showed positive elisa responses on days 42 and 56 table 3 in the control group all participants were seronegative except for one participant who showed a borderline optical density value of 05 on day 0 the exact cutoff value for seropositivity figure 4a

 representative elispot wells are shown in the appendix p 21 t-cell responses against mers-cov spike emerged after a single vaccination with mva-mers-s in some of the participants and were enhanced after boost immunisation overall ifn secretion was detected in ten 83 of 12 participants in the low-dose group and ten 91 of 11 participants in the high-dose group at one or more timepoints throughout the study t-cell responses were observed to all peptide pools however responses to pool m2 were more frequently detected seven 58 of 12 participants in the low-dose group vs seven 64 of 11 participants in the high-dose group than to other pools four 33 vs five 45 for m1 four 33 vs one 9 for m3 three 25 vs three 27 for m4 and five 42 vs five 45 for m5 figure 5b both groups showed an increase in ifn secretion compared with day 0 which was detected in the low-dose group on day 28 and in the high-dose group on day 35 at the earliest a peak response was observed for m2 at day 42 appendix p 21 the highest magnitudes of ifn responses were observed for two participants in the low-dose group upon m1-pool stimulation 622 and 522 sfcs per million pbmcs respectively an additional post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of six participants three in each group demonstrated mers-cov spike-specific secretion of ifn predominantly from cd8 t cells rather than from cd4 t cells when using flowcytometry appendix p 22 taking into account the number of assay responders over time both dose cohorts showed a similar pattern the earliest assay responders were identified at day 28 figure 5c at day 180 in the low-dose group six 55 of 11 participants one participant was removed from day 180 analysis as outlined previously still showed positive t-cell responses and in the high-dose group one participant showed a response to evaluate the breadth of t-cell responses we assessed the number of pools to which the participants responded the high-dose group revealed a response to more than one pool already at day 28 which reduced in breadth over time by comparison the low-dose group showed an increase in breadth only after the boost immunisation figure 5d taken together these data show that immunisation with mva-mers-s induced t-cell responses which decreased during the study period but remained detectable following homologous prime and boost immunisations with mva-mers-s no single severe or serious adverse events were observed in participants who received either the low dose or the high dose of the vaccine all participants experienced transient self-limiting mild-to-moderate adverse events mostly dose-dependent local reactions as well as unspecific systemic adverse events these data demonstrate a favourable safety profile for both doses and two administrations safety signals were similar to those observed in a phase 1 trial testing the influenza vaccine mva-h5-sfmr18 in which participants received the same doses with the identical mva backbone similar safety profiles have been observed in other trials using the mva platform with inserted antigens derived from pathogens11 12 19 comparison of mva-mers-s vaccine-induced safety profiles suggests vector-specific rather than insert-specific safety signals no mers-cov-specific adverse events as outlined by the brighton collaboration were observed vaccination with mva-mers-s elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses to mers-cov spike which were mostly detectable following boost rather than prime immunisation the humoral immune responses measured by elisa and two different viral neutralisation assays revealed a peak of antibody responses at days 42 and 56 were maintained through day 84 and declined to baseline levels in the majority of study participants by end of study 6 months after vaccination although the exact contribution of mers-cov-specific antibodies to immune protection against mers remains to be further elucidated preclinical data support their role in protection against virus challenge in animal models6 9 20 21 a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral rna transcripts in mva-mers-s-vaccinated dromedary camels was observed following mers-cov challenge that was associated with mers-cov-specific neutralising antibodies16
 albeit not an optimal animal model mouse studies can support the investigation into protective mechanisms mice are not susceptible to mers-cov but with expression of human dpp4 transgenic mice or adenoviral-mediated delivery mers-cov can infect mouse cells and challenge experiments can be supported the impact of antibodies on immune protection through passive immunotherapy with subsequent challenge experiments was evaluated passive immunotherapy before mers-cov challenge using mers-cov-specific monoclonal antibodies or sera obtained from mers-cov-positive immune dromedary camels showed protection in mice expressing human dpp420 21 22 although safety and tolerability of anti-mers-cov polyclonal antibody treatment in humans has been demonstrated23 protection against mers in humans has not yet been documented notably mouse experiments demonstrated the generation of neutralising antibodies upon mva-mers-s vaccination which only partially mediated neutralisation by the receptor-binding domain rbd6 indicating that other parts of the mers-cov spike glycoprotein might also induce neutralising antibodies in this context a notable outcome of the mouse experiments was the protective capacity of s1-specific non-rbd and s2-specific neutralising mouse antibodies against mers-cov6 7 24 furthermore it was demonstrated that s2 monoclonal antibodies showed only moderate neutralising capacity in vitro but were highly protective from challenge in vivo suggesting that strong neutralising activity is not conditional for protection7 future analyses should therefore include not only mers-cov s1-specific but also s2-specific antibody assays and other functional antibody read-outs beyond neutralisation capacity which are currently understudied systems-serology approaches including non-neutralising functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis might provide insight into mva-mers-s-induced immunity and dissect additional mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection however it should be noted that although animal studies indicate a crucial role for antibodies in protection against mers the human data available from mers-cov-infected individuals so far did not reveal a clear and strong correlation between mers-cov-specific antibody responses and mers-cov viral load25 26
 reports on individuals with mers-cov infection revealed predominantly t-cell responses as opposed to antibody responses in survivors as well as exposed dromedary camel workers9 27 although it has not yet been determined that t-cell responses are crucial for mers-cov clearance in humans animal models have provided evidence that t cells support viral clearance in mice8 15 in this study we detected vaccine-induced t-cell responses against mers-cov spike which were present even before the second immunisation responses persisted until day 180 in a third of study participants seven 32 of 22 participants suggesting that vaccine-induced t-cell responses were maintained slightly longer than humoral immune responses three 14 of 22 participants we observed stronger and more robust t-cell responses in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group although this finding was not significant it might be considered in future studies that focus on dose finding when including a larger number of participants however the exact contribution of t-cell immunity to vaccine-induced or natural protection against the disease and viral clearance remains to be determined and needs further investigation to complement our analyses on vaccine-induced immunity to the mers-cov spike antigenic insert of the vector vaccine we also investigated vector immunity to the mva backbone mva-specific humoral responses against the mva vector were assessed post-hoc using a virus neutralisation test assay against wild-type mva to address their potential effect on mers-cov spike-specific antibodies although mva-specific neutralising antibodies were induced no correlation with mers-cov-specific binding or neutralising antibody responses was observed currently there is no strong evidence that induced or pre-existing mva-specific immunity interferes with vaccine-induced immune responses when using mva as a vector our study and the trial using mva-h5-sfmr18 show that mva-based vaccines can elicit antibody responses against the antigenic insert following the second and third immunisation despite the induction of anti-vector immunity after the prime injection the exact impact of pre-existing immune responses against mva requires further investigation in future studies rapid induction of vaccine-induced immunity following single-shot vaccination schemes is considered to be particularly useful in outbreak scenarios however mva-mers-s showed no induction of strong mva-mers-s-specific immune responses following a single prime vaccination which might reduce its direct applicability in acute outbreak scenarios in the context of limited human data on correlates of protection it is currently challenging to predict whether mva-mers-s is suitable for rapidly evolving epidemic situations because it remains unclear which specific parameters are relevant for the defence against mers-cov it is conceivable that homologous mva primeboost vaccination might not be the final and optimised vaccination schedule for mva-mers-s different strategies including heterologous primeboost regimens should be evaluated in future trials several mers vaccine candidates are currently being tested in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations is funding five different vaccine platforms with mva-mers-s chadox1 and dna being the most advanced in the first mers vaccine trial in humans reported to date which investigated a dna-based vaccine gls-530028 a homologous primeboostboost regime was used similar to our study the authors observed a favourable safety profile and induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses although seroreactivity and cellular responses were largely maintained over the study period of 60 weeks neutralising antibodies were detectable in only 48 of vaccine recipients peaked about 2 weeks after the second boost and rapidly declined additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether heterologous primeboost vaccination schedules with a mva-mers-s chadox1 or dna prime and a boost with mva-mers-s can induce immune responses protective against mers-cov infection or can at least favourably modulate the mers disease course further studies are warranted to improve our detailed understanding of the role of antibody titres neutralising and non-neutralising antibodies and cellular immune responses in both natural and vaccine-induced protective mers-cov-specific immunity to further enhance and accelerate strategic vaccine development against mers the ultimate assessment of vaccine efficacy will be challenging because outbreaks are unpredictable and the number of mers cases has been relatively low although the data presented here make a valuable contribution to the mers vaccine agenda and enterprise the study also has limitations the restricted number of study participants in this phase 1 trial limits the generalisability of results and necessitates follow-up studies in larger cohorts the study did also not include an additional late boost which induced strong and increased antibody responses in a previous mva-h5-sfmr trial18 this early study format also did not allow for data generation on antibody dependent enhancement in the context of mers-cov infections which has been previously discussed for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus29 future studies in animal models possibly including adoptive transfer experiments with sera derived from vaccinated individuals as well as clinical trials will need to address this crucial aspect in conclusion the phase 1 trial investigating the candidate vaccine mva-mers-s showed a benign safety profile and provides the first evidence of humoral and cellular immunogenicity induced by this candidate vaccine in humans the data generated so far support its further development as a mers vaccine candidate for homologous or heterologous vaccination schemes possibly involving other viral vector vaccines in 2018 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations included mva-mers-s in its funding portfolio to support scalable manufacturing and further clinical development to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in larger cohorts and endemic areas the favourable profile of mva-mers-s might also make useful contributions for the development of future vaccine strategies against other coronavirus pathogens such as the recently emerged sars coronavirus 2 however crucial knowledge gaps remain to be addressed individual participant data will be shared including data dictionaries all of the individual participant data collected during the trial will be shared after de-identification other documents that will be made available include the study protocol and informed consent forms

mers an emerging infectious disease first identified in june 2012 is caused by the novel mers-coronavirus mers-cov 1 mers-cov a zoonotic virus has bats as its natural reservoir and possibly dromedary camels as its intermediate host 23 mers-cov infects humans especially the elderly people with diabetes and chronic lung diseases and immunocompromised persons causing severe disease with high mortality  35 the mers outbreak has resulted in 1474 laboratory-confirmed cases including 515 deaths as of august 27 2015 4 there is still a possibility for mers-cov to spread within healthcare facilities to which a number of cases have been linked 56 most mers cases have been reported from saudi arabia but south korea is the second largest country with travel-associated mers cases which can all be traced back to saudi arabia the continuous spread of mers-cov possibly through camel-to-human and human-to-human transmission has raised worldwide concerns calling for immediate steps to develop effective and safe vaccines the genome of mers-cov encodes at least four unique accessory proteins such as 3 4a 4b and 5 two replicase proteins open reading frame 1a and 1b and four major structural proteins including spike s envelope e nucleocapsid n and membrane m proteins 7 the accessory proteins play nonessential roles in mers-cov replication but they are likely structural proteins or interferon antagonists modulating in vivo replication efficiency andor pathogenesis as in the case of sars-cov 7-9 the other proteins of mers-cov maintain different functions in virus replication the e protein for example involves in virulence and deleting the e-coding gene results in replication-competent and propagation-defective viruses or attenuated viruses 7 the s protein is particularly essential in mediating virus binding to cells expressing receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 through receptor-binding domain rbd in the s1 subunit whereas the s2 subunit subsequently mediates virus entry via fusion of the virus and target cell membranes 1011 therefore these viral structural proteins particularly s protein may serve as targets for vaccine development it is demonstrated that all circulating human mers-cov strains represent one single serotype and that virus isolates from other parts of the outbreaks have no differences from emc2012 the prototype strain in replication interferon escape responses and serum neutralization suggesting that vaccines developed based on the prototype virus strain unlikely affect their success against other virus strains 1213 no mers vaccines are available for human use vaccines against mers-cov thus far developed in the laboratory can be categorized as those based on viral vectors such as adenovirus ad and modified vaccinia virus ankara mva or those based on recombinant viral proteins dnas nanoparticles and recombinant virus table 1 most viral vector-based mers vaccines use the full-length s or s1 protein of mers-cov as the coding antigens and exhibit immunogenicity in vaccinated animals reports have indicated that recombinant ad5 vectors which encode the full-length or s1 extracellular domain of mers-cov s protein induced mers-cov s-specific antibody responses in immunized mice neutralizing mers-cov infection in vitro
14 ad5 or ad41 vectors expressing full-length s protein of mers-cov have elicited mers-cov-specific antibody responses neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses in immunized mice 15 moreover a viral vector mva-based mers vaccine expressing viral s protein termed mva-mers-s demonstrated efficacy against mers-cov infection in addpp4-transduced mice 1617 these studies suggest the potential of applying mers-cov s protein as a vaccine target the german center for infection research dzif has supported the phase i clinical trial of mva-mers-s vaccine candidate in humans about usd 166 million was awarded to initiate this trial 18 in addition to viral vector-based vaccines vaccines based on the recombinant mers-cov s protein in particular rbd have demonstrated efficacy in protecting immunized animals from mers-cov infection 1920 several fragments including residues 350  588 358  588 367  588 367  606 377  588 and 377  662 in the rbd of mers-cov s are shown to induce mers-cov neutralizing antibody responses in mice andor rabbits 2122 thus similar to the rbd of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the mers-cov rbd also contains a critical neutralizing domain cnd capable of eliciting highly potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against infection from mers-cov particularly a fragment containing residues 377  588 of mers-cov rbd has been identified as a cnd able to protect ad5hdpp4-transduced and hdpp4-transgenic mice against mers-cov notably s377  588 is a very effective immunogen as 1 g of s377  588 protein could induce potent neutralizing antibody responses similar to those raised by high doses such as 5 and 20 g respectively 2324 these reports all confirm that the rbdcnd of mers-cov in the s protein is an important target for the development of mers subunit vaccines dna vaccines are proven to be effective against mers-cov infection an optimized dna vaccine encoding full-length s protein of mers-cov was able to elicit antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice camels and rhesus macaques non-human primates nhps with six of the eight vaccinated macaques showing no radiographic evidence of infiltration after mers-cov challenge interestingly potent antigen-specific cellular immune responses were induced in the immunized macaques suggesting that t cell responses may also play a role in mers-cov protection 25 inovio pharmaceuticals inc in collaboration with geneone life science will perform a phase i clinical trial for this dna-based vaccine 26 in addition to the dna-only strategy dna-priming and protein-boosting could be an alternative vaccine approach for mers-cov it is revealed that full-length s dna priming and s1 subunit protein boosting immunization of mice and nhps induced robust neutralizing antibody responses against several mers-cov strains protecting nhps from mers-cov challenge 27 other potential candidates have been suggested as mers vaccines for example purified mers-cov full-length s nanoparticles in combination with appropriate adjuvants could elicit neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice 28 using reverse genetics recombinant mers-cov may efficiently replicate in cell culture of human cell lines with broad tissue tropism allowing an engineered mutant mers-cov lacking the structural e protein to be rescued and propagate in cells expressing the e protein in trans thus providing a platform to develop live-attenuated or recombinant mers-cov-based vaccines 79 the induction of neutralizing antibodies is the key to the prevention of mers-cov infection as supported by the fact that the reduction of lung pathogenesis and protection from mers-cov infection has been correlated with neutralizing antibody levels in the animal models 2329 in addition vaccines that enjoy a high safety profile combined with the ability to induce broad-spectrum immune responses and strong protective neutralizing antibodies should have top priority for further development efficacy and protective immunity of mers candidate vaccines are of necessity evaluated in appropriate animal models thus before moving to clinical trials nhp rhesus macaque and common marmoset models 3031 and camel model 32 have been established and utilized for such purposes however the use of nhp and camel models is financially and facility restrictive for many researchers fortunately recent advancements in establishing small animal models including ad5hdpp4-transduced mouse model 33 and hdpp4-transgenic mouse models 34 have provided a portable and economical platform for assessing the efficacy of mers candidate vaccines despite the fact that each of these animal models has its advantages and disadvantages although very promising the recombinant mers-cov-based vaccines will need to be further characterized in suitable mers-cov animal models to confirm their efficacy and safety viral vector-based vaccines on the other hand may show protective immunity in challenged mouse animals however these vaccines might have safety concerns by the presence of pre-existing immunity in humans in the case of ad or the potential to induce harmful immune responses thus safety tests are strongly recommended also this vaccine type might lead to incomplete protection or fail to protect aged groups as shown in the case of sars-cov vaccines 35 by comparison recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines possess the highest safety profile because they utilize full-length spike protein or its subunit eg s1 or fragment eg rbd as the antigen in the presence of suitable adjuvants this type of vaccine is generally able to induce higher titers of neutralizing antibody responses than those elicited by other vaccine types and they can be easily injected via different pathways including intramuscular injection an adopted route for human vaccines importantly some of these mers subunit vaccines are shown to be protective against mers-cov infection in challenged mouse andor nhp models 2327 demonstrating their ability for further scale-up andor human clinical trials among these recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines we believe that rbd-based vaccines are more effective and safer than those based on the full-length s protein rbd contains the cnd in the s protein and most of the highly potent neutralizing antibodies target the rbd 2136-38 recombinant proteins containing rbd induce strong neutralizing antibody responses and protection in the vaccinated animals against mers-cov infection 2123 in contrast the full-length s protein contains some non-neutralizing immunodominant domains which may compromise the immunogenicity with the cnd in rbd or even induces virus-enhancing or harmful immune responses as demonstrated in the s protein of sars-cov 39 this may be one of the reasons that the development of full-length s protein-based sars vaccine has been discontinued one may criticize that the vaccines based on the rbd sequences of the current mers-cov strains might be not effective against future emerged mers-cov strains with mutations in rbd this should not be a problem for rbd-based vaccines because rbd contains several conformational neutralizing epitopes and thus mutations in one epitope may not significantly affect the neutralizing activity of antibodies elicited by other epitopes for example the rbd-specific mab f11 could not neutralize the bisha1 strain of mers-cov whose rbd contains 509 mutation but susceptible to neutralization of d12 another mers-cov rbd-specific mab 27 previous studies have demonstrated that rbd of sars-cov tor2 strain which contains six different conformational neutralizing epitopes induces antibodies in the vaccinated animals with neutralizing activity against all sars-cov strains tested including those caused by the early sars outbreaks eg gd03 strain and late sars pandemics eg urbani strain as well as the sars-like cov strain from civets sz strain 40 although some epitopes outside mers-cov rbd may have neutralizing activity such ability is significantly lower than that of the rbd for example neutralizing mabs g2 and g4 target epitopes at mers-cov s1 and s2 respectively both of which are outside the rbd their neutralizing ability is not as potent as rbd-specific mabs f11 and d12 27 nevertheless these non-rbd neutralizing epitopes if being clearly identified could be potentially included in vaccine design to increase the breadth and strength of mers-cov vaccines it is common knowledge that the process of vaccine approval is long and that it is further complicated by regulatory restrictions and a shortage of funds as a case in point mers vaccines are urgently needed yet big pharma has consistently refused to invest funds for manufacturing or developing in pre-clinical and clinical studies based on the uncertainty of immediate return on such investments in addition adequate financial support from government entities is not guaranteed by the general lack of funds as noted above however some firms in us and dzif academy in germany have taken the first step toward clinical trials of the two mers vaccines based on dna and viral vector respectively big pharma and governments of these countries and other parts of the world should take note of this signal and act accordingly  evaluation of a recombination-resistant coronavirus as a broadly applicable rapidly implementable vaccine platform rachel graham l damon deming j meagan deming e boyd yount l ralph baric s   emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viral diseases are major threats to global human health economic stability and national security16 the incidence of human zoonotic disease is estimated to surpass 1 billion cases per year with novel emerging infectious diseases accruing hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses78 losses that are greatly magnified when new emerging viruses such as coronaviruses covs devastate economically critical livestock populations across the globe with the continued encroachment of human populations into animal habitats and our close contact with domesticated animals zoonoses will continue to increase as the human and livestock population numbers and density expand over the next century in fact a recent study recognized that the majority of emerging infectious disease events have origins in wildlife38 underscoring the importance of developing broadly applicable strategies for vaccine design for virus families that are harbored within extensive zoonotic pools vaccines are well established in their capacity to reduce viral disease burden live-attenuated vaccines because they can elicit balanced innate and adaptiveand often lifelongprotective immune responses including lactogenic immunity are ideal candidates for vaccine development in humans and animals1 however their utility as broadly applicable vaccine platforms has long been limited by risks of reversion of attenuated vaccine strains to virulence largely because the stability of the attenuation cannot be clearly evaluated or assured the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in the 21st century emphasizes the threat of pandemic viral infections originating from cross-species transmission events911 these highly pathogenic variants are prime models for the development of broad-based strategies for evaluating live virus vaccines for the nidovirales order coronaviruses covs all reproduce with conserved replication strategies emphasizing the strength and rapidly adaptable potential of a vaccine design platform that takes advantage of this biology covs replicate and transcribe subgenomic rnas sgrnas via a discontinuous transcription mechanism mediated by transcription regulatory sequences trss a series of conserved nucleotide sequences positioned near the 5-end of the genome and at several locations immediately 5 of each downstream open reading frame orf fig 1 these trss regulate a transcription attenuation program via base-pairing interactions between the leader trs and body trss that results in the production of sgrnas from which downstream orfs are translated within the trs a 6- to 8-nt core sequence acgaac for sars-cov guides base-pairing and duplex formation between nascent rna and the leader trs1214 while this collective trs arrangement the transcription regulatory network trn is conserved our laboratory has shown that it is possible to rewire the guide sequence of the sars-cov trn and produce infectious virus13 we also showed that recombination between this rewired trn virus and wild-type wt sars-cov was not viable indicating that recombination-mediated reversion of a cov vaccine platform featuring a rewired trn is highly unlikely based on conservation of the trn biology across covs this report further explores the feasibility of the development of a stably attenuated vaccine platform featuring a completely rewired trn as a candidate strategy for a broadly applicable rapidly implementable cov vaccine platform that is highly resistant to recombination repair and stably attenuated in both young and highly vulnerable mouse models of human disease in a previous study in our laboratory we demonstrated that the sars-cov trn could be reprogrammed provided the individual trss were replaced with matching sequences13 the rewired trn replaced the conserved 6-nt trs with a 6-nt cassette that is not used in any other characterized covs encoding a net change of 3 nts acgaac to ccggau our previous work showed that this rewired trn was refractory to recombination with wt genomes13 therefore we tested its replication and pathogenesis in young and aged balbc mice consistent with earlier reports wt sars-cov only caused weight loss in aged animals in contrast crg3 replicated but caused no weight loss in young 10-week-old mice fig 2a and minimal weight loss in aged 12-month-old balbc mice fig 2b young mice p  025 for titer wilcoxon test p  037 for weight loss mann-whitney test old mice p  025 for titer p  0001 for weight loss both wt and recombinant viruses replicated to high titers that were detectable on days 2 and 4 post-infection pi in both young and aged animals with titers beginning to clear by day 7 pi fig 2c d as is usually observed in mice infected with sars-cov1 the high replication titer and low or absent virulence in young and aged mouse models paired with the inherently recombination-refractory genome suggested that the crg3 virus would be an ideal vaccine candidate to test crg3s efficacy in protecting against homologous and heterologous challenge the virus was administered to mice in a single-dose vaccination alongside viral replicon particles vrps expressing the viral spike attachment protein vrp-s as a control15 on day 22 post-vaccination mice were then challenged with either mouse-adapted sars-cov ma15homologous challenge or sars-cov expressing the spike gene from the himalayan palm civet paguma larvata strain hcsz6103 heterologous challenge mice were then observed for morbidity and mortality and surviving animals were euthanized on day 4 pi upon homologous challenge crg vaccination was protective against weight loss and mortality in young and aged mice with no detectable viral titer in the lungs at 4 days pi in contrast to pbs and vrp-s subcutaneous vaccination fig 3ad supplementary fig 1a-b importantly against heterologous challenge while both crg3 and vrp-s vaccines were protective in young mice only crg3 was protective in aged mice against replication and mortality with no detectable titer in the lungs at 4 days pi fig 3eh supplementary fig 1cd crg vaccination induced sars-cov neutralizing antibody titers approaching 4 log10 in both young and aged mice nearly 2-fold higher than the titers induced by vrp-s vaccination p  00001 two-way anova supplementary fig 1e moreover crg vaccination largely protected aged mice from the extensive inflammatory cell infiltration tissue damage perivascular cuffing edema and septal thickening observed in pbs- and vrp-s-vaccinated mice supplementary fig 2 a live-attenuated vaccine candidate should demonstrate phenotypic stability in infected host populations therefore to test its resistance to reversion to virulence crg3 was subjected to five independent serial passages in parallel with wt sars-cov in aged 14-month-old balbc mice over the course of six 4-day passages all crg3 passaged viruses acquired a virulent phenotype with weight losses and percent survival curves mirroring the kinetic rates of the emergence of virulence seen with wt passaged viruses supplementary fig 3 to attempt to identify the genotypic causes of this phenotypic reversion to virulence the genomes of 5 independent plaque isolates of the passage 6 viruses wt p6 and crg3 p6 were submitted to sanger sequencing surprisingly and contrary to expectations no mutations in either the spike or the membrane proteinboth of which were targets for mutational selection in 3 separate adaptations of sars-cov urbani to mice fig 4awere identified in wt or crg3 revertants instead 4 of 5 crg3 p6 isolates showed evidence of often large deletions in the accessory orfs 7b 8a and 8b fig 4a b these deletions often in-frame were reminiscent of several incidences of host range-associated deletions identified in human isolates from the 2003 sars-cov epidemic including a 29-nt deletion in orf8 relative to the himalayan palm civet strain16 and 82-nt17 and 386-nt18 deletions in this same region in contrast deletions in accessory orfs were rare in virulent wt revertants rather scattered nonsynonymous mutations were identified in orf1a orf3a orf8a and orf9 notably only 1 wt revertant exhibited a small deletion in orf7b collectively these findings demonstrated that this region of the sars-cov genome is inherently unstable when subjected to replication pressure especially in aged animals and indicated that a trn-rewired virus would require additional stabilizing mutations to be feasible as a vaccine candidate the demonstration of second-site reversion to virulence upon passage of crg3 suggested that a more ideal trn-rewired vaccine candidate would be one that would be less likely to phenotypically revert in vivo cov trs networks are finely tuned and regulate the expression of both highly abundant and low-frequency mrna transcripts thus small changes in the trs might subtly alter the regulation of subgenomic transcripts13 moreover the exact regulatory milieu around each trs is uncertain beyond the recognition that both up- and downstream sequences can influence mrna expression efficiency perhaps in a trn sequence-specific manner1920 we hypothesized that more extensive remodeling of the trs network may better disrupt the finely tuned network of abundant and low-frequency transcripts altering the natural regulation of global gene expression and thereby leading to decreased virulence in addition it was possible that the virulence observed in crg3 p6 isolates was due at least in part to mouse adaptation during passage therefore to evaluate the effects of more extensive trn rewiring in a lethal pathogenic model and to further stabilize the trn against recombination repair and mutation selection a trn mutant was constructed that featured the following 1 the set of 6 mouse-adapted mutations present in the sars-ma15 virus see fig 4a and 2 a newly designed trn consisting of a 7-nt complete replacement of the 9 sars-cov trs loci acgaac to uggucgc  crg7-ma  fig 1 these replacements yielded infectious crg7-ma virus that was capable of replicating to titers equivalent to those of the mouse-adapted wt background virus sars-ma15 though with a pinpoint plaque phenotype that remained stable after tissue culture passage crg3-ma 9 crg3 replacements in the virulent sars-ma15 backbone was also generated as a control trn-rewired virus northern blot analysis of crg7-ma versus crg3 and sars-ma15 revealed that the virus produced the expected bands at similar proportions to wt virus although some additional low-abundance transcripts were also noted in crg7-ma supplementary fig 4 these viruses were then evaluated for replication and virulence in young 10-week-old and aged 12-month-old balbc mice in comparison with sars-ma15 in young mice crg7-ma was attenuated compared with crg3-ma and sars-ma15 causing a weight loss of 5 p  00001 t test on days 25 pi for crg7-ma vs crg3-ma though replicating to high titers approximately 7 log10 pfu for crg7-ma vs 8 log10 pfu for crg3-ma and sars-ma15 at 2 days pi further crg7-ma showed evidence of more rapid clearance kinetics with a nearly 3-log10 difference in titer compared with the crg3-ma and sars-ma15 controls at 4 days pi fig 5ac p  0001 t test for both 2 and 4 days pi for crg3-ma vs crg7-ma while morbidity and mortality were more pronounced in old mice crg7-ma was still attenuated compared with crg3-ma and sars-ma15 in terms of weight loss less weight loss on days 24 pi p  005 on days 2 and 4 pi t test crg3-ma vs crg7-ma and lung titer 8 log10 pfu for crg7-ma vs 9 log10 pfu for crg3-ma and sars-ma15 on day 2 pi p  00001 t test crg3-ma vs crg7-ma 25-log10 pfu difference in titer on day 4 pi p  005 t test crg3-ma vs crg7-ma fig 5df infection of aged balbc mice with 2 log10 3 log10 or 4 log10 pfu of crg7-ma or sars-ma15 emphasized the attenuated virulence phenotype with the 2-log10 pfu infection of crg7-ma causing almost no weight loss over the course of the infection despite replicating to the same titers as the 3 log10 and 4 log10 pfu infections fig 5gh under identical conditions sars-ma15 mice lost more body weight 20 and experienced 60 mortality rates survival was markedly different between crg7-ma and sars-ma15 infections with 100 of mice infected with 2 log10 or 3 log10 pfu and 60 of mice infected with 4 log10 pfu surviving the course of crg7-ma infection in contrast only 40 of mice infected with 2 log10 pfu of sars-ma15 survived infection mice infected with 3 log10 or 4 log10 pfu survived only until days 6 or 3 pi maximum respectively p  00001 log-rank test fig 5i when crg7-ma was serially passaged in young 10-week-old balbc mice in contrast to the rapid phenotypic reversion observed with crg3 crg7-ma remained phenotypically stable with passage with mice losing a minimal 5 amount of their starting weight over the 3-day infections throughout all 4 passages supplementary fig 5a viral titer also remained stable over passage with 5 log10 pfu detectable at 3 days pi in each passage supplementary fig 5b furthermore when crg7-ma was serially passaged independently three times for six passages in aged mice replicating the passage conditions in which crg3 reverted to virulence crg7-ma did not exhibit an increase in virulence causing 20 weight loss in infected animals and 60 mortality upon infection of 12-month-old balbc mice with 105 pfu of crg7-ma post-passage essentially replicating the mortality shown in aged mice infected with non-passaged crg7-ma virus and distinct from the 100 mortality caused by wild-type sars-ma15 infection of aged mice see fig 5i supplementary fig 5c-d and supplementary table 1 finally crg7-ma was evaluated for its capacity to protect against lethal sars-ma15 challenge in aged 12-month-old mice mice were vaccinated with 25 log10 pfu of either crg7-ma or exon-ma which we previously demonstrated to be an effective vaccine in the sars-ma15 backbone in the aged balbc mouse model of sars-cov pathogenesis1 on day 22 post-vaccination mice were then challenged with a lethal dose 5 log10 pfu of sars-ma15 and evaluated for weight loss mice lost only minimal amounts 5 of their starting weights with both vaccines p  0125 for both viruses versus pbs vaccination wilcoxon test indicating that crg7-ma and exon-ma were equally protective against lethal sars-ma15 challenge fig 6 live-attenuated vaccines remain key players in reducing the global disease burden associated with viral infections in humans critically important livestock and companion animals historically and contemporarily live-attenuated vaccines have been used with success to help control measles mumps rubella polio yellow fever and chickenpox infections and outbreaks12122 however live-attenuated vaccines are also associated with the risk of reversion by either mutation- or recombination-driven processes which can cause dangerous outbreaks in unvaccinated populations including animals22 for example highly pathogenic porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv strains emerged in china in 2012 circumventing existing vaccines and rna recombination events between wild-type and live-attenuated pedv and between avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv strains have seeded new outbreaks2326 therefore measures are needed to stabilize live-attenuated vaccines against reversion under selective pressure particularly for viruses like covs which employ recombination as a standard feature of their replication cycle as incidental recombination events in the context of a co-infection could unintentionally introduce alleles with enhanced virulence into an attenuated vaccine genome with consequences that could be difficult to predict132728 several groups including our own have developed novel strategies in fidelity regulation and control that attenuate rna virus pathogenesis and in the case of covs the development of mutants that prevent reversion repair to virulence129 recombination repair is a well-characterized process essential for genome evolution in many biological systems and plays critical roles in spread virulence and pathogenesis30 in general strategies to engineer recombination-resistant rna viruses have been limited to covs and to a lesser extent enteroviruses1331 in the context of a cov infection recombination occurs when the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp switches templates during nascent rna synthesis using the nascent rna itself as a primer once the rdrp reassociates with the template genome the likelihood of a recombination event occurring is regulated by several viral factors including replication rates rna secondary structure genome size and the nature of the replicasetranscriptase protein complex however the heritability of a recombination once it has occurred is mediated by the replication fitness of the resulting progeny genome133235 several reports have described the emergence of covs with enhanced virulence that upon genome analysis clearly originated from recombination events of related viruses in avian and mammalian hosts including sars-cov27283638 furthermore reservoir species such as bats from which the prevailing evidence suggests that both potentially lethal human covs sars-cov and mers-cov emerged have been shown to harbor multiple cov species and recombinant rna genomes have been frequently identified within colonies and among individual infected animals increasing the likelihood of recombination-driven alterations in species specificity and virulence16273940 thus engineering elements to render a genome recombination-refractory is an essential step towards ensuring that a live-attenuated vaccine candidate cannot regain virulence during an incidental co-infection with another trn-compatible cov genome sars-cov is a highly pathogenic pneumo-enteric pathogen that captures many disease features seen among other covs the trn conserved sequence cs motifs utilized in the crg3 and crg7 backgrounds ccggau and uggucgc respectively are both unique sequence motifs when compared with all known cov genome trn sequences greatly reducing and likely eliminating the possibility of recombination with unmodified genomes at the canonical trs loci our previous work demonstrated that introducing mismatched trss was lethal for rna recombinant virus replication13 furthermore here we showed that crg3 trn replacement did not revert at the primary sites of mutation indicating that the rewired trn is stable and not under sufficient selective pressure to revert even in vivo as coordinated interactions are required for trn function trn reversion is unlikely given the requirement for nearly simultaneous reversions at multiple sites across the genome larger-sized trs css 7 nts within the trn may not prove effective as evolution appears to have selected for a cov rna polymerase that is heavily focused on recognizing a 5- to 7-nt trs cs within the trn to regulate subgenomic transcription the attenuation resulting from trn rewiring is most likely attributed to alterations in the viral transcription profile low-abundance transcripts that either encode or reduce the expression of previously unidentified out-of-frame orfs or viral or host factor interactions with the viral genome the rewired trn produces obvious novel viral rna species supplementary fig 4 these novel rna species may serve as functional mrnas producing noncanonical viral protein products that attenuate viral replication or pathogenesis alternatively these novel rna species may compete with canonical viral rna species for replication and transcription attenuating viral replication andor pathogenesis due to the altered availability of transcripts encoding bona fide viral virulence factors furthermore the rewired trn itself may serve as an attenuating factor as the virus discontinuous transcription program alters programmed rna-protein interactions involving both viral and host proteins either directly ie by altering the bases required for rna-protein interactions or indirectly ie through changes in the rnas secondary structure that affect the steric availability of rna-protein interaction sites moreover di et al in an arterivirus model used next-generation sequencing analysis to show that noncanonical transcripts are produced in the course of wild-type infection indicating that the coding capacity of nidoviruses is actually much larger than what has been characterized using sanger sequencing and biochemical detection methods their findings suggest that attenuation via the trn may be able to target noncanonical rna species which might be able to impact pathogenesis with fewer effects on replication and structural protein production41 these fascinating possibilities will be the focus of future studies on the mechanism of trn-related attenuation the hypothesis that alterations in the expression profiles of canonical viral rna species and protein products attenuate pathogenesis is further strengthened when paired with observations of the types of mutations that were selected upon passage of crg3 in aged mice mutation profiles were different if selection occurred in young versus aged populations frieman et al previously demonstrated that mutations in spike and nonstructural protein 9 nsp9 were repetitively selected in several independent passages and that these mutations conferred virulence in young mice suggesting that spikeviral receptor interactions and nsp9replicase protein interactions were most important for virulence42 in severely ill sars-cov-infected humans predominantly over 50 years of age deletions in and around orf8 were identified as discussed earlier161839 deletions of different accessory orfs were the most frequently observed changes after selection in aged animals furthermore in aged mice nearly any combination of 2 sars-ma15-identified alleles shown in fig 4a also conferred increased virulence most likely reflecting the increased susceptibility of aged mice to lethal outcomes these data suggest that cov adaptation to virulence is different in young and aged animals especially when coupled with variations in virus pathogenic determinants while immune senescence can enhance virus virulence43 our data support the novel hypothesis that virulent zoonotic coronaviruses may emerge more quickly after in vivo passage especially in the aged where multiple evolutionary pathways exist that can program virus virulence the disproportionate identification of mutations in the accessory orfs following passage of the crg3 trn virus in aged animals may reflect the roles these accessory orfs are hypothesized to play in the modulation of host immunity44 aged animals immune systems respond differently and usually more severely to microbial challenge with the immune response skewed towards severe innate immune effects and defects in adaptive immunity45 however in the context of cov infection this augmented immune response when presented in the context of accessory orf deletion may serve as a virulence fulcrum with the balance poised between essential immune recognition and severe disease possibly due to defects in spread and persistence these potential effects on host immunity argue that a stable vaccine candidate should consider the potential for changes in accessory orfs a well-designed vaccine candidate should include genetic traps that are either independently attenuating or triggered by recombination events we have previously demonstrated both stable attenuation and protection against lethal challenge with inactivations of the nsp14 exonuclease1 and the nsp16 2-o-methyltransferase46 activities in addition zst et al demonstrated that a partial deletion of the murine hepatitis virus mhv nsp1 replicase protein could protect against homologous and heterologous challenge47 combining alleles that render the virus recombination-refractory alter rna replication fidelity and that result in an altered host immune response could produce stable reversion-proof live-attenuated viruses that induce robust neutralizing immunity attenuating alleles coupled with a rewired trn are anticipated to increase the stability of the attenuation and to minimize the chances for rna recombination repair the strategies reported herein coupled with the availability of new molecular clones for covs that cause severe disease in livestock populations provide a vehicle for improved live virus vaccine design4853 it may also be possible to tune the cov trn with attenuating changes concentrated on virulence alleles such as accessory genes known to impact pathogenesis such alterations have the potential to greater enhance the stability of a vaccine candidate particularly if considering trs context outside of the 5- to 7-nt core sequence such studies would benefit the most if the rna structure is also considered as trs accessibility is most likely modulated by structural elements in the cov rna genome such studies will be the focus of future work with the continuing identification of zoonotic pools of covs that genetically resemble lethal human and animal covs often with only a few percentage points of difference between the zoonotic and lethal human sequences105457 the necessity for a rapidly implementable universal attenuation platform for cov live-attenuated vaccine design is underscored in this report we described the design and implementation of a cov attenuation strategy that can be easily and rapidly adapted to any cov genome the presence of 89 characterized trss within any cov genome the css of which are 67 nts each offers too large and complex a target for primary site reversion to be a likely event as most single recombination events would decouple trn expression networks these recombinants would be lethal therefore this attenuation strategy when paired with alleles that can resist selection events that lead to second-site reversion could bring live-attenuated cov vaccines within the reach of realization in the face of the ever-growing threat of new human and animal cov-based

concepts pablo becker d carlos guzmn a  despite the availability of antimicrobial agents and vaccines community-acquired pneumonia remains a serious problem severe forms tend to occur in very young children and among the elderly since their immune competence is eroded by immaturity and immune senescence respectively the main etiologic agents differ according to patient age and geographic area streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae respiratory syncytial virus rsv and parainfluenza virus type 3 piv-3 are the most important pathogens in children whereas influenza viruses are the leading cause of fatal pneumonia in the elderly effective vaccines are available against some of these organisms however there are still many agents against which vaccines are not available or the existent ones are suboptimal to tackle this problem empiric approaches are now being systematically replaced by rational vaccine design this is facilitated by the growing knowledge in the fields of immunology microbial pathogenesis and host response to infection as well as by the availability of sophisticated strategies for antigen selection potent immune modulators and efficient antigen delivery systems thus a new generation of vaccines with improved safety and efficacy profiles compared to old and new agents is emerging in this chapter an overview is provided about currently available and new vaccination concepts  the mucosa of the human respiratory tract represents a primary target for a large number of microbial pathogens typically colonization is an asymptomatic process resulting from the interplay between bacterial factors and host clearance mechanisms clinical illness may result from either the local release of bacterial toxins or the systemic dissemination of the pathogen after breaching the mucosal barrier in the course of respiratory infections adaptive immune responses could be significantly impaired this might lead to more severe forms of disease or to super-infections which in turn complicate the clinical management of the patient the most severe forms of respiratory infection tend to occur in very young children and among the elderly in whom immune competence is eroded by immaturity or immunesenescence respectively in addition patients who are immunocompromised as a result of disease or therapeutic interventions have the greatest risk of developing a fatal infection despite the availability of new antimicrobials and effective vaccines community-acquired pneumonia remains a common and serious illness in fact it is a leading contributor to the nearly 4 million deaths occurring each year due to respiratory infections especially in children from developing countries 1 2  the main causative agents of pneumonia differ according to the patient age and the geographic area in addition there are relatively few comprehensive studies on the specific aetiology of pneumonia 2 due to i overlaps in the clinical manifestations of the different syndromes ii difficulties in establishing the precise aetiology and iii frequent occurrence of co-infections however streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae respiratory syncytial virus rsv and parainfluenza virus type 3 piv-3 have been identified as the main agents responsible for acute respiratory infections in children whereas influenza virus related pneumonia is the leading cause of disease-related deaths in the elderly in addition the availability of new and more sensitive diagnostic tests have contributed to the identification of hitherto unknown lower respiratory pathogens such as the human metapneumonovirus hmpv and novel coronaviruses causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars significant efforts have been invested in the last two decades to develop new diagnostic tools to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and to understand host clearance mechanisms this resulted in an improved knowledge on host responses to infection and immuno-pathogenesis which in turn have facilitated the establishment of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions however despite our accomplishments in vaccine development there are many pathogens for which vaccines or adequate therapies are not available or the existent ones are suboptimal the main approach applied for vaccine development has radically changed in recent years whole cell vaccines are systematically being replaced by subunit vaccines in which purified antigens or their coding genes are exploited in combination with new adjuvants andor delivery systems as a result many of the vaccines under development will exhibit consistently improved stability safety and efficacy profiles they will also be amenable for mucosal administration thereby mimicking natural infections influenza a viruses are the most commonly responsible for severe respiratory illness in humans followed by influenza b the populations susceptibly to infection is renewed annually because of the rapid antigenic variation of this virus the antigenic variation is due to the accumulation of point mutations in the two major surface glycoproteins of the virus haemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na this can lead to an antigenic drift of the virus which often leaves current influenza vaccines outdated and ineffective antigenic shift can also occur due to the segmented nature of the viral genome that favours the emergence of re-assorted strains in which an entire glycoprotein can be acquired from a different animal influenza virus both types of variation represent a critical bottleneck for the establishment of a robust vaccination strategy against influenza in fact when an influenza virus with the capacity to spread from person-to-person and a complete new glycoprotein subtype suddenly emerges a worldwide pandemic outbreak can result 3  the earliest vaccines against influenza were whole cell vaccines obtained in the 1940s by inactivating viruses grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs with formalin while contemporary inactivated influenza vaccines are still produced in embryonated eggs improvements in manufacturing have resulted in a highly purified and less-reactogenic detergentsplit product three viral strains are selected on the basis of the previous years surveillance data on the most prevalent subtypes therefore vaccine composition may vary from year-to-year vaccination has a high benefitcost ratio since influenza-related illness eg hospitalizations and deaths are effectively prevented 1  the worlds total vaccine production is approximately 300 million doses with a maximum capacity of 900 million doses however the world health organization who estimates that there are about 12 billion people at high risk for severe influenza outcomes eg elderly over 65 years of age infants health care workers children and adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease furthermore the global infrastructure would not be able to handle the timely manufacturing and distribution of a vaccine for a pandemic outbreak 4  one alternative would be to lower the quantity of antigen per dose and add adjuvants to the vaccine formulation but this needs to be tested in clinical trials 5  another solution would be to improve current vaccine production technologies ie egg-derived vaccines however there is the limited number of egg producers and viral strains can emerge which could not be easily adapted to embryonated eggs to overcome these problems several pharmaceutical companies have embarked themselves on projects for the development of vaccines produced by growing the virus on cell lines the influenza virus can be adapted to grow on a variety of mammalian cell lines including vero perc-6 and madin-darby canine kidney mdck cells 6 7 8  this strategy would also improve the possibility of up-scaling vaccine production in face of a pandemic spread alternatively it would be possible to develop a vaccine against any influenza virus such as the avian h5n1 strain by using reverse genetics techniques 9 see below in advances in vaccinology cold adaptation was found to be a reliable and efficient procedure for the derivation of live attenuated viral vaccine strains for humans cold-adapted ca virus strains can grow in primary chick kidney cells or embryonated eggs at 25-33c however they exhibit a reduced replication at 37c the process of genetic re-assortment with the transfer of the six internal genes from a stable attenuated ca master donor strain of influenza a or b to the new prevailing wild-type epidemic strain has been used to generate attenuated cold-reassorted vaccines with the proper level of attenuation genetic stability and immunogenicity which show low or absent transmissibility 10  medimmune and wyeth have developed along these lines a trivalent live ca vaccine flumist for intranasal spray delivery which was licensed in 2003 in contrast to parenterally-administered vaccines this formulation triggers immune responses resembling those observed after natural infections 11  despite the moderate hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titres observed in vacinees flumist showed 92 efficacy over a 2-year period in children including protection against antigenic variants that circulated during the second year 12 13 14  this ca vaccine also stimulated the production of nasal iga as well as t-cell and interferon responses 15  the cell-mediated immunity against virus matrix and nucleoprotein antigens may favour viral clearance and early recovery from illness 3  the advisory committee on immunization practices has recommended its use only in persons from 5 to 49 years of age since side-effects were observed in young children wheezing nasal congestion and there are no data available for elderly 16 17  despite its remarkable genetic stability this vaccine has to be kept at -18c thus a new heat stable derivative has recently been developed which showed good efficacy in clinical trials 1  a live vaccine based on a master virus strain developed at the institute of applied microbiology austria by growing wild influenza virus in vero cells at 25c was also demonstrated to be safe well-tolerated and immunogenic after intranasal immunization in young adults 18 a number of subunit-or dna-based vaccines are also in various stages of development an influenza vaccine formulated in virosomes has been commercialized by berna biotech inflexal  v it contains the surface spikes of the three currently circulating influenza virus strains inserted in vesicle membranes of the three corresponding virus types for more details see section pseudoviruses as antigen delivery systems 19  this company has also developed a virosome-based nasal formulation however it was withdrawn from the market due to the presence of sideeffects ie bells palsy which was assumed to be linked to the presence of the escherichia coli heat labile toxin lt as adjuvant two companies yeda and bionvax are also developing a peptide-based influenza vaccine for nasal administration which showed protective efficacy in humanized mice 1  a subunit vaccine containing recombinant ha protein produced using a baculovirus system was successfully tested in a phase ii trial in 64 to 89-year-old volunteers an epidermal dna-based influenza vaccine which contained the ha gene from apanama200799 delivered by particle-mediated epidermal delivery was also tested in humans by powderject 20  serum haemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses were observed in volunteers receiving a single dose of 1 2 or 4 g of dna with the strongest and most consistent responses in subjects vaccinated with the highest dosage some immunization approaches aim at the development of a universal vaccine with a broad spectrum of protective activity against different influenza strains 21 among them the use of the highly conserved transmembrane m2 protein of the virion can be mentioned a recombinant particulate vaccine has been engineered by genetically fusing copies of the m2 to the hepatitis b core antigen hbc the m2-hbc fusion protein spontaneously assembled into virus-like particles vlp which provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with influenza virus a in mice 22 23  promising results were also obtained after vaccination with a m2 peptide conjugated with a neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein complex ompc in monkeys 24  the human piv hpiv consist of four serotypes with hpiv-3 being the second leading cause of bronchitis and pneumonia in infants no vaccine has been licensed to date against piv however several approaches are currently under investigation the initial attempts to provide protection by using vaccines based on formalin-inactivated viruses failed subsequent work demonstrated that the glycoproteins haemagglutininneuraminidase hn and f which are responsible for virus attachment and fusion are able to stimulate the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies in animals however their poor immunogenicity in nave subjects led to the currently favoured approach which is based on the use of live attenuated piv live attenuated piv vaccines have been developed from both human and bovine strains which are amenable for delivery by the intranasal route candidate vaccines should be able to replicate and induce a protective immune response in young infants even in the presence of maternally acquired antibodies two main attenuated strains have been studied in detail one is the hpiv-3 strain cp45 which was selected after 45 passages of the virus in african green monkey cells at low temperature the other is a bovine piv bpiv-3 strain which is antigenically related to the hpiv-3 and replicates poorly in humans both cp45 and bpiv-3 have been evaluated in phase iii trials in sero-positive and sero-negative children and in young infants they were found to be over-attenuated in sero-positive children but immunogenic in sero-negative children and infants 25  however the magnitude of the anti-hn response was lower in children who received the bpiv-3 vaccine 25 this prompted the engineering of chimeric bovinehuman piv-3 candidates eg hpiv-nb strain in which the human nucleocapsid is replaced by the bovine counterpart or a bpiv-3 strain that expresses the f and hn proteins of hpiv-3 attenuated chimeric viruses that contain piv-3 cp45 internal genes with the f and hn genes from either piv-1 or piv-2 have also been tested in hamsters 26  berna biotech is also developing a virosomal formulation of the piv-3 1  using the successful approach of the influenza vaccine a formalin-inactivated candidate against the respiratory syncytial virus rsv was tested in children in the 1960s the consequence was the hospitalization of 80 of vaccinees and two deaths 1  moreover vaccinated children also suffered more severe disease on subsequent exposure to the virus as compared to unvaccinated controls 27  this demonstrated that the elicitation of a strong immune response is not sufficient to confer protection against disease and can even lead to immuno-pathological reactions thus it is essential to stimulate the right type of immune response in the particular case of rsv host responses play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease thereby making the development of a preventive vaccine extremely difficult in addition naturally acquired immunity to rsv is neither complete nor long-lasting and recurrent infections often occur 28  however older children and adults are usually protected suggesting that protection against severe disease develops after several consecutive infections passive immunization with rsv-neutralizing immune globulins was also shown to prevent rsv infection in newborns with underlying cardiopulmonary disease 29  this demonstrates that antibodies play a major role in protection against this disease whereas t-cell immunity targeted to internal viral proteins appears to contribute to clearance although live attenuated vaccines seem to be preferable for immunization of nave infants subunit vaccines may be of choice for elderly high-risk children and pregnant women candidate subunit vaccines based on purified f proteins pfp-1 -2 and -3 were demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic even during pregnancy 30  maternal immunization using a pfp-based vaccine could be an interesting strategy to protect infants younger than 6 months of age 25  however no significant protection was reported in a phase iii trial performed on children 1-12 years of age with cystic fibrosis after vaccination with a subunit vaccine based on pfp-3 31  a formulation based on surface glycoproteins f and g together with the virion matrix protein m from rsv-a was tested in healthy adult volunteers in the presence of either alum or polyphosphazene as an adjuvant short-live neutralizing antibody responses to rsv-a and rsv-b were detected in 76-93 of the vaccinees suggesting that annual boosting will be needed 32 33 34  the central domain of the g protein of rsv-a is relatively conserved among viruses from the groups a and b thus a recombinant vaccine candidate bbg2na was developed by fusing the g2na domain to the albumin binding region of streptococcal protein g this candidate was shown to be moderate immunogenic in adult human volunteers but its clinical development was interrupted due to the appearance of purpura in vaccinees 1  the main two difficulties associated with the generation of live attenuated vaccines against rsv are over-or under-attenuation of the virus and limited genetic stability temperature-sensitive ts ca and cold-passaged cp mutant viral strains have been generated despite the attenuation shown in adults and sero-positive children cpts mutants still caused moderate congestion in the upper respiratory tract of sero-negative infants 1-2 months old 35  recombinant rsv vaccines with deletions in non essential genes eg sh ns1 or ns2 which also carry cp and ts mutations in essential genes are currently being evaluated 1  through recombinant dna technology chimeric viruses were engineered which contain the genes of hpiv-3 surface glycoproteins f and nh together with those of rsv glycoproteins f and g in a bpiv-3 genetic background one of these candidates was found to be attenuated and able to induce the elicitation of immune responses against both hpiv-3 and rsv in rhesus monkeys 36  similarly a bpiv-3 genome was engineered to express hpiv-3 f and hn proteins and either native or soluble rsv f protein 37  the resulting strain which induced rsv neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against rsv challenge in african green monkeys needs to be tested for safety and efficacy against rsv and piv-3 in infants this emerging disease was originally described in the guangdong province of china in 2002 even when the global outbreak of sars was under control in 2003 new infections were reported in persons who had contacts with animals in 2003 and 2004 38  the typical sars-cov-like virus is not transmitted from animals to humans however under certain conditions the virus can evolve into the early human sars-cov which has the ability to be transmitted from animals to humans or even humans to humans thereby leading to localized outbreaks of mild disease the early human sars-cov under selective pressure in humans may further evolve into the late human sars-cov which can cause local or global outbreaks of typical sars 39  sars can be easily grown in cell cultures 38  thus there is an urgent need for vaccines not only to prevent naturally occurring epidemic outbreaks but also as a tool against the threat of biological weapons several structural proteins are expressed by sars-cov including nucleocapsid envelope and spike s proteins 38  the latter is a type i trans-membrane glycoprotein which is responsible for virus binding fusion and entry and being the major target of neutralizing antibodies 38 40  the extracelullar domain of the s protein consists of two subunits s1 and s2 40  the s1 subunit possess a receptor-binding domain rbd which is responsible for viral binding to one of its receptors 41 42  vector-based vaccines expressing the s protein as well as dna vaccines encoding full-length s protein have been assessed in preclinical studies 43 44  when modified vaccinia virus ankara mva coding for full-length s protein was administered by either intranasal or intramuscular route neutralizing antibodies were elicited 45  however vaccination of ferrets resulted in liver damage after challenge raising some concerns about the safety of this approach 46  vaccines formulated using different synthetic peptides encompassing linear b cell epitopes from the s protein which were identified using sera from convalescent patients stimulated high antibody titres nevertheless none of them triggered the elicitation of neutralizing activity on the other hand some studies demonstrated that although antibodies against s protein of the late sars-cov urbani strain exhibit neutralizing activity they can also enhance infection by an early human sars-cov isolate gd03t0013 and the civet sars-cov-like viruses a derivative of the s protein with a truncation at amino acid aa 1153 fails to cause antibody dependent enhancement of infection but retains the ability to induce neutralizing antibodies these findings suggest that the elimination of the putative heptad repeated 2 hr2 aa 1153-1194 which is implicated in viral fusion might abrogate the stimulation of virus infection-enhancing antibodies 47 48  the use of the nucleoprotein of the coronavirus in a dna vaccination protocol also led to the stimulation of a protective response 49  in contrast protection was not achieved when a recombinant piv-3 expressing the nucleoprotein alone or together with the matrix protein was used 50  this demonstrates that the selection of the delivery system and immunization strategy play a critical role in vaccine efficacy the human adenoviruses are divided into six subgroups a-f the adenovirus can cause large-scale epidemics of acute respiratory disease and dissemination is especially favoured under conditions in which persons are housed communally the subgroup a viruses such as ad31 have been associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised patients neutralizing antibodies directed against the capsid hexon and fiber proteins seems to be the main effector mechanism to prevent re-infections by adenovirus 3  until 1998 military recruits in usa were administered enteric-coated capsules containing live viruses from the serotypes 4 and 7 the virus which was not attenuated if delivered by respiratory route was able to replicate in the gastrointestinal tract without causing disease thereby stimulating protective responses in the respiratory tract 51  when the vaccine went out of production outbreaks of respiratory diseases caused by adenovirus reemerged among the military recruits 3  since serotypes 1 2 3 and 5 cause the 80 of adenovirus associated respiratory disease in young children the development of a tetravalent vaccine similar to the above mentioned might solve the problem in children 52  however the implementation of a vaccine live or attenuated against adenovirus should be carefully evaluated since recombinant adenoviruses are proposed both as vaccine vectors and as tools for the transfer of foreign genes in gene therapy protocols polysaccharide-based vaccines against s pneumoniae in 1945 macleod et al 53 reported the protective efficacy of a capsular polysaccharide ps vaccine in military personnel during an outbreak of pneumococcal pneumonia the immunization with purified ps showed a drastically reduced reactogenicity in comparison with the previously used inactivated whole cell vaccines this was a major breakthrough not only in terms of safety but also because it demonstrated that a specific virulence factor can be purified and effectively implemented for the prevention of an infectious disease thereby paving the road for modern non toxoid-based subunit vaccines although the serological correlates of immunity are poorly defined type-specific anti-capsular antibodies are responsible for protective immu-nity however immunity is serotype specific rendering extremely difficult the development of a universal vaccine this is in part due to the elevate number of serotypes the regional variations in dominant serotypes and the lack of updated sero-prevalence data for certain regions these problems have been partially solved by the use of ps-based polyvalent vaccines the currently licensed formulations contain 23 serotypes of s pneumoniae which cover approximately 90 of serious pneumococcal disease but only in western industrialized countries relatively good antibody responses 60-70 are elicited in healthy adults 2-3 weeks after a single intramuscular or subcutaneous immunization 54  unfortunately they are poorly immunogenic in children aged less than 2 years in immune compromised individuals eg aids patients and in elderly people with concomitant disease and they do not induce good immunological memory randomized controlled trials in healthy elderly and young men also failed to show a beneficial effect against pneumonia 55  however vaccination is recommended for healthy people over 65 years of age to confer protection against invasive disease 54  ps-based vaccines can be also used in pregnant women to stimulate the production of antibodies which are transferred to the foetus via the placenta or to the newborns by breast-feeding however it is still a matter of controversy whether maternal vaccination can indeed protect newborns against pneumococcal infections 56  the second generation of ps-based conjugate vaccines stimulates stronger antibody responses even in infants young children and immune deficient individuals as well as immunological memory these vaccines also suppress nasopharyngeal carriage of the pathogen and reduce bacterial transmission in the community leading to herd immunity which adds considerable value to their implementation the introduction of these vaccines in usa in 2000 resulted in a dramatic decline in the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease 1 57 58  a significant reduction in the incidence rates among non vaccinated individuals was also observed as a result of herd immunity 59 60  however the licensed seven-valent vaccine does not contain some of serotypes that cause severe disease in developing countries ie serotypes 1 and 5 new conjugate vaccines including more serotypes such as the ninevalent vaccine wyeth and two 11-valent vaccines glaxosmithkline and sanofi-pasteur should provide better serotype coverage new approaches to develop protein-based subunit vaccines against s pneumoniae are currently being pursued by different research groups this is expected to enable the generation of a universal vaccine conferring protective immunity against a large number of serotypes as well as to avoid the complexity of manufacturing a conjugate vaccine 61  there are different pneumococcal candidate antigens such as the pneumolysin neuraminidase autolysin pneumococcal surface protein a pspa and adhesin a psaa which are in an early phase of clinical development 1  in addition several promising candidates have been identified which are currently being tested in pre-clinical experimental models 1  among them the two iron uptake abc transporters of s pneumoniae piaa and piua which trigger protective immunity against invasive pneumococcal disease in mice through the screening of s pneumoniae genomic expression libraries with sera from convalescent patients bacterial surface proteins were identified eg bvh-3 and bvh-11 that promote the elicitation of protective anti-pneumococcal antibodies in mice 1  a recombinant hybrid protein bvh311v has successfully been tested in toddlers and elderly volunteers this candidate vaccine should be able to trigger serotype-independent responses since the bvh3 and bvh11 antigens are common to all serotypes of s pneumoniae the major obstacle for developing an effective vaccine against h influenzae capsular ps was related to the inherently poor immunogenicity of this t-cell-independent antigen antibody responses against ps are age-related with extremely poor immunogenicity in infants during the first 18 months of life unfortunately this age group exhibits the highest risk for invasive infections caused by h influenzae a ps-based vaccine against the h influenzae type b hib was licensed in the united states in 1985 for children more than 18 months old 62 63  the protective efficacy after licensure studies showed the inefficacy of this vaccine not only in infants but also in older children 64  this problem was solved by the generation of a conjugate hib vaccine to this end the hib ps ie polyribosylribitol phosphate prp was covalently linked to an immunogenic carrier protein thereby leading to t-cell-dependent responses against the ps different conjugate hib vaccines currently exist these vaccines are hboc prp-t and prp-omp which make use of the mutant diphtheria toxin crm197 the tetanus toxoid and the outer membrane protein from group b n meningitidis as carriers respectively all of them trigger similar immune responses at the recommended doses however the dynamic of the elicited response may vary for each of them 65 66  efficacy studies of these vaccines showed that they confer protection not only against meningitis but also against pneumonia 67 68 69  although hib vaccines are highly effective their cost is still prohibitive for the worlds poorest nations however with the establishment of the global alliance for vaccines and immunization gavi we have moved consistently ahead in making them also available for developing countries gavi has approved the establishment of a hib initiative to support countries wishing to sustain hib vaccination as well as those exploring whether their introduction could be considered a priority in the near future although the introduction of conjugated ps vaccines has significantly decreased the prevalence of invasive hib disease paediatric infections due to non typeable h influenzae nthi are still highly prevalent nthi is most often associated with otitis media sinusitis and bronchitis in addition nthi is an important cause of lower respiratory infection in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd thus the development of a vaccine against nthi is considered an important goal in public health in contrast to hib vaccines against the non-encapsulated nthi strains must be directed against alternative virulence factors the lipoproteins d and p6 are widely distributed and antigenically conserved among h influenzae strains and also trigger the elicitation of protective immunity in animals vaccinated by mucosal route 70 71 72 73  thus their incorporation in vaccine candidates might facilitate the generation of a universal vaccine against all typeable and non typeable h influenzae even in the age of vaccine availability b pertussis continues to be a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality ie approximately 50 million cases and 300000 deaths occur annually worldwide since the late 1940s the incidence of whooping cough has dramatically decreased in most developed countries as a result of widespread immunization the first vaccine formulations which are still in use consist of preparations based on killed b pertussis the frequent incidence of minor adverse effects eg fever protracted crying and local erythematous reactions as well as concerns raised by reports of serious neurological side-effects resulted in a decline in vaccine acceptance and use 74  this in turn led to a re-emergence of whooping cough and its complications this serious problem prompted the development of a new generation of acellular vaccines in 1981 japan was the first country to successfully introduce acellular vaccines against whooping cough in its immunisation programme 75  leading to a consistent reduction in the reported side-effects in the mid 1980s a major phase iii trial of acellular vaccines was undertaken in sweden at a time when the banning of the whole cell vaccine had resulted in a pertussis epidemic in that country 76  the first vaccine trials contained chemically detoxified pertussis toxin pt and filamentous haemagglutinin fha or detoxified pt alone the results of these trials showed that whilst producing good antibody responses the vaccines failed to give an adequate level of protection in infants the mono-component vaccine conferred no protection against infection whereas the use of the two component candidate only gave incomplete protection against infection 77  the results obtained in japan and sweden stimulated vaccine companies in the usa and europe to establish vigorous research programmes aimed at the development of a new generation of acellular vaccines with higher efficacy currently available vaccines have incorporated chemically or genetically inactivated pt and additional virulence factors such as fha the outer membrane protein pertactin prn and fimbrial proteins fims the efficacy studies of this second generation of acellular vaccines have demonstrated that they confer levels of protection equivalent to the whole cell vaccines the advent of improved techniques for antigenic characterisation and the introduction of acellular vaccines containing genetically defined components also resulted in a reduction of lot-to-lot variation in comparison with conventional whole cell vaccines and the acellular formulation originally introduced in japan however despite the wide implementation of vaccination campaigns in infants and children the disease continues to be endemic in addition in countries with high vaccine coverage we are now observing a consistent increment in the cases of pertussis in adolescents and adults 78 79 80  these patients can then transmit the disease to infants thereby now representing a primary reservoir for bacterial transmission and cycling in the community the above-mentioned observations can be explained by one or more of the following factors i improved detection techniques ii major awareness on the possibility that bacteria may affect these age groups iii vaccinedriven antigenic changes in circulating isolates and iv reduction in vaccine efficacy over time in this context concerns have been raised about genetic variation between the strains used for vaccine preparation and circulating isolates this seems to be true since the currently used whole cell and acellular vaccines are prepared with strains that were isolated before mass vaccine introduction and show clear mismatches with respect to circulating strains there is a steady tendency to decrease diversity in recent isolates together with clonal expansion during epidemic outbreaks 81 82  over time at least two surface proteins pt and prn may have changed sufficiently to allow for an increase in the incidence of disease unfortunately our global information on antigenic variation and disease in adults and adolescent is extremely limited thus despite widespread introduction of pertussis vaccines it is essential to continue surveillance studies and collection of circulating strains the present view is that successful control of pertussis in the community may require routine immunization of adolescents and adults with the new acellular vaccines perhaps in combination with the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids dtap this intervention might help in turn to reduce the burden of disease and transmission to infants chlamydia pneumonia is an intracellular bacterium transmitted person-toperson via respiratory droplets this pathogen is a common cause of pneumonia with infections usually being oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic in young age groups however the rate of asymptomatic carriage in the normal population is unknown there is also a tremendous gap in our understanding of host response to infections caused by c pneumoniae most of the studies have been focused on the development of efficient diagnostic methods however less work has been done on vaccine development and there is a paucity of knowledge on the microbial components which may serve as target antigens in fact at present there are no licensed vaccines against c pneumoniae however the potential of different antigens such as the major omp2 83 have been assessed in experimental animal models nevertheless mice vaccinated with omp2 using a protocol based on priming with dna and boosting with recombinant vlp showed only partial protection 84  recent studies also suggested that ctl responses play a role in protection and clearance 85  animals immunized with a mini-gene encoding seven h-2b-restricted ctl epitopes fused to a endothelial reticulum-translocation signal showed protection following intranasal challenge with a virulent c pneumoniae 85  the current view is that multi-component vaccine will be required in order to induce a protective response 86  using the promising approach of reverse vaccinology combined with proteomics see section reverse vaccinology the whole-genome of c pneumoniae was screened searching for vaccine candidate antigens among exposed and immune accessible surface proteins 87  the selected candidates were then expressed in a heterologous system and used in immunization studies approximately 53 proteins were able to trigger the elicitation of c pneumoniae-binding antibodies when tested in secondary screenings six of them were also able to neutralize bacteria in vitro and four inhibited systemic dissemination of c pneumoniae in a hamster model 86  moraxella catarrhalis is the third most common bacterial etiologic agent of otitis media in children furthermore m catarrhalis is an important cause of respiratory infections in patients with copd thus different studies have been carried out to characterize potential protective antigens in this context two major omp cd and e have been identified which are considered prime candidate antigens for vaccine development these proteins are expressed on the surface and show a high degree of conservation among circulating strains both omp triggered the elicitation of bactericidal antibodies and protective immunity in preclinical models 88  additional candidates are the uspa1 protein 89  which seems to be required for bacterial colonization of the human upper respiratory tract the iron-induced omp b1 and lbp and the iron-repressed omp b2 90  a conjugate vaccine based on detoxified lipo-oligosaccharide was also tested in mice by intranasal route with encouraging results 91 92  some of these candidates are planned to be tested in clinical studies soon 90  mycoplasmas are commensal microorganisms as well as opportunistic pathogens mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the causative agents of acute and chronic human respiratory diseases and the main responsible for primary atypical pneumonia accounting for approximately 20-30 of all community-acquired pneumonia 93  there is a considerable underreporting for m pneumoniae-associated diseases this is in part due to the wide diversity of clinical manifestations the difficulties associated with its cultivation from clinical specimens and the lack of adequate diagnostic tools no vaccines are currently available against this pathogen however studies conducted in human volunteers in the late 1960s demonstrated that a formalin-inactivated whole cell vaccine and an acellular extract were able to confer moderately protective immunity against m pneumoniae 94  unfortunately immune pathological reactions were observed following challenge with live organisms therefore studies are still needed to understand the underlying mechanisms to the observed autoimmune responses 95  more specifically we need to elucidate the specific role played by humoral and cellular response in protection against m pneumoniae m pneumoniae is one of the smallest self-replicating prokaryotic pathogens approximately 800 kb the complete genome sequence is now available this is expected to expand our knowledge on the physiological and virulence properties of this agent as well as new hints for vaccine development a previously unrecognized bacterium was isolated after the outbreak of legionnaires disease in 1976 which was designated legionella pneumophila 96 97  the spreading of l pneumophila is increasing due to the use of air-conditioners and humidifiers since infections can occur by inhalation of aerosolized contaminated water sources several approaches have been developed in the fight against this facultative intracellular pathogen infection and immunization induce a rapid increase of antibody titres however antibodies do not seem to play a significant role in host resistance particularly after aerosol challenge 98 99 100  some authors also suggested that these antibodies can promote bacterial phagocytosis thereby favouring invasion and subsequent intracellular replication 101  in contrast cellular responses appear to be important for protection different vaccine candidates were tested in the past heat- acetone-and formalin-killed l pneumophila vaccines were not able to confer protective immunity in guinea pigs whereas animals immunized with l pneumophila membranes survive an aerosol challenge with virulent bacteria 98 99  additional work demonstrated that also purified antigens such as the major secretory protein 98  the major cytoplasmatic membrane protein 102  the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein 103  omps 104 and flagella 100 can confer protection against challenge with virulent l pneumophila finally different live attenuated mutants of l pneumophila were used in animal infection models with promising results 105  cystic fibrosis cf patients are particularly susceptible to severe bacterial infections of the lung being pseudomonas aeruginosa one of the most prominent etiologic agents thus significant efforts have been invested to develop a vaccine against this pathogen surface ps are among the antigens that were most intensively assessed berna biotech have developed an octavalent vaccine against the eight most prevalent serotypes based on o-ps conjugated with the exotoxin a 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113  a consistent reduction in the number of cf patients with chronic p aeruginosa lung infection was observed in a cohort receiving the basic immunization protocol followed by yearly boosters over a period of 10 years 112 113  the conjugate vaccine induced the production of specific igg antibodies and increased the number of igg memory b cells it is still unclear if cellular responses might contribute to the overall protection conferred by this vaccine however strong proliferative responses of lymphocytes with a th1 phenotype were observed in vaccinated individuals in response to the carrier exotoxin a protein 113  alternative vaccination strategies are currently being tested in clinical trials among them formulations based on a fusion protein between the outer membrane proteins f and i which have been administered by parenteral and mucosal routes 114 115  these formulations were demonstrated to be safe in volunteers and conferred increased protection against p aeruginosa in cf patients cell-surface alginate flagella components of the type iii secretion system inactivated toxins and proteases are other proposed target antigens 116  some of them are already in clinical trials alone or in combination 116  when pasteur returned from his summer holidays in 1881 to continue with his studies on chicken cholera he inoculated chickens with an old culture of pasteurella multocida which was left during the whole summer on his bench the animals that received the preparation were protected against a challenge performed with a fresh isolate thus pasteur developed the hypothesis that pathogens could be attenuated by exposure to environmental insults eg high temperature oxygen and chemicals 117  the strategy was then successfully extrapolated for developing anthrax vaccines in livestock in the 1880s with significant economic benefits this was followed by the generation of attenuated vaccines against rabies and other important pathogens towards the end of the nineteenth century pasteurs approach for attenuating or inactivating a pathogenic organisms still constitutes a cornerstone in vaccine technology 117  this exemplifies that until recently the major achievements in vaccinology have been facilitated by technological eg adjuvants delivery systems reverse vaccinology genetic engineering rather than immunological advances 117 118 119  however it is expected that the impressive knowledge accumulated in recent years in the fields of immunology immune pathology and microbial pathogenesis will pave the road to a new golden era in vaccinology in which knowledge and technology will enable rational vaccine design in the 20th century pertussis vaccines progressed from crude bacterial preparations to the highly purified antigens used for acellular vaccines a similar quantum jump in technology allowed the development of subunit vaccines against influenza hib and s pneumoniae as well as the production of antigens by recombinant dna techniques eg genetically inactivated pt despite the fact that these techniques enable the production of almost any foreseeable antigen the identification of suitable targets still remained as a main bottleneck for vaccine development 120  the advent of genomics and its exploitation in the vaccinology field have rendered possible the implementation of a systematic and holistic approach for the screening identification and prioritisation of candidate antigens this new approach called reverse vaccinology 121  does not require cultivation of the original pathogen thereby being amenable for highlypathogenic or non culturable micro-organisms it is possible to predict and select the most promising candidates by the analysis of genomic sequences in silico which will then be cloned and expressed in heterologous systems the resulting proteins are then used to perform immunological andor functional studies to select the most promising candidates eg able to induce the production of microbicidal or neutralizing antibodies capacity to confer protective immunity flanking studies are usually carried out such as molecular epidemiological analysis to assess their degree of conservation among circulating strains or transcriptional profiling to evaluate their expression during natural infections 122  the time-consuming process in which highly expressed components of an in vitro cultivable organism are identified one at a time and separated different components between them is one of the disadvantages that reverse vaccinology has solved the conventional method usually requires 15-20 years to arrive to a clinical trial whereas reverse vaccinology reduces the process to approximately 5 years reverse vaccinology also allows the identification of hundreds of potential candidates in a few days in comparison with the small number of antigens that conventional approaches have provided after decades of research moreover reverse vaccinology offers the possibility to select potential candidates independent of their expression levels or purification easiness the reverse vaccinology approach has proved its usefulness in the field for both viral and bacterial pathogens eg hepatitis c virus group b meningococci group b streptococci 123 124  reverse vaccinology has also become an essential tool for several vaccine development projects against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia eg c pneumoniae streptococci the potential and speed of genomic-based approaches was also shown when the nucleotide sequence of the coronavirus causing sars was made available in less than one month in addition the increasing number of available genomes from bacteria and viruses would allow comparative genomic studies thereby providing hints on conserved protein families andor functional domains this would facilitate the generation of vaccines using immunogens covering multiple micro-organisms 125  despite the incredible potential of reverse vaccinology this approach also has some important limitations tab 1 among them is the fact that it is not be possible to identify non-protein antigens eg ps glycolipids which are the cornerstone for many successful vaccines eg pneumococcal and hib vaccines currently available influenza vaccines see above are based on inactivated viruses and more recently attenuated ca viruses and virosomes all these vaccines exploit the same starting material wild-type virus which is inactivated or attenuated the last approach consists in the co-infection of chicken eggs with the new isolate and a master attenuated strain and subsequent selection for re-assorted viruses with the desired genotypephenotype however the virulence of certain virus strains such as the h5n1 renders difficult the implementation of this traditional strategy the use of reverse genetics represents a valid alternative for the generation of vaccines against rna respiratory viruses such as the influenza virus piv and rsv it consists in the production of the virus from cloned dna 126  thereby allowing the development of vaccines against any pandemic viral strain in some cases eg avian h5n1 an additional mutagenesis step would be required to attenuate its virulence 127  then the new ha and na segments would be transferred into an appropriate influenza a virus master strain adapted to grow in a cell line the final re-assorted virus will have the antigenic specificity of the pandemic strain and the growth characteristics of the master strain 128 129  this technology would also allow production of the influenza vaccine in cells that are co-transfected with plasmids encoding for different frag- 130  therefore the complete genome is inside the cell and virus can be produced and assembled one of the main advantages is that a plasmid encoding for ha and na can be easily replaced therefore re-assortment and selection become unnecessary this method would considerably reduce the time for vaccine production from many months to only a few weeks another advantage would be the simple manipulation of the genome contained in plasmids which would enable detoxification of specific virulence factors similar approaches can be implemented for other viruses such as rsv piv and sars-cov however intellectual property and liability issues are still obstacles for the industrial development of reverse-genetics-based vaccines 131  furthermore since the resulting viruses are considered genetically modified organisms additional problems may arise from the regulatory stand point 131  most of the infective agents are either limited to the mucosal membranes or need to transit across them in order to cause disease therefore it is highly desirable to elicit an efficient immune response at the local site in which the first line of defence is laid the stimulation of a pathogen-specific response at the portal of entry is expected to impair infection ie colonization thereby reducing the risk of transmission to susceptible hosts parenterally administered vaccines mainly stimulate systemic responses whereas vaccines given by the mucosal route mimic natural infections thereby leading to efficient mucosal and systemic responses thus there is a considerable interest in the development of mucosal vaccines however antigens administered by this route are usually poorly immunogenic different strategies are being pursued to overcome this bottleneck among them can be cited the use of i advanced synthetic delivery systems ii live attenuated bacterial or viral vectors iii bacterial ghosts iv pseudoviruses and v mucosal adjuvants 132 133 134 135  advanced synthetic mucosal delivery systems particulate antigens are more immunogenic than those in solution due to their vulnerability to degradation by enzymes and extreme ph thus it would be helpful to incorporate them into a protective vehicle often these vehicles do not serve only to protect them but can also enhance their uptake promote targeting to antigen presenting cells and serve as adjuvants 136  the most commonly exploited delivery systems are i gelatine capsules which are dissolved at alkaline ph in the intestine but not in the stomach ii muco-adhesive polymers that are highly viscous inert ps iii eldexomer and carboxymethyl cellulose which have been used for oral nasal and vaginal delivery iv lipid-based structures with entrapped antigens such as immune stimulating complexes iscoms and liposomes and v biodegradable micronano-spheres based on biocompatible materials such as starch copolymers of lactic or glycolic acid 137 138  some of these approaches are currently being explored to develop vaccines against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia encouraging results have been obtained among others using surface antigens from s pneumoniae encapsulated in micro-spheres 139 and a iscom-adjuvanted vaccine obtained by reverse genetics against the influenza virus in preclinical models 140  attenuated viruses and bacteria can be used not only as vaccine candidates per se but also as delivery systems for heterologous antigens thus many attenuated microorganisms have been exploited as a scaffold for the development of subunit vaccines against other agents under the premise that the expression of the recombinant antigens does not increase their pathogenic potential for humans or animals the most frequently exploited bacterial vectors are attenuated derivatives of salmonella enterica and shigella spp and the bacille calmette-gurin bcg for example vaccination with an attenuated salmonella expressing the oprf-opri was also shown to be able to confer protection against p aeruginosa in a murine experimental infection model 141  in addition it was also demonstrated that a recombinant bcgbased vaccine expressing the pspa confers protection against s pneumoniae in an infection animal model 142  the use of commensals represents an alternative to attenuated organisms eg lactobacilli in this context it was demonstrated that oral administration of lactobacillus expressing proteins from coronavirus can protect against a gastric infection 143  thus this approach has been also proposed to combat sars promising results were also obtained using x chlamydia psittaci 144  on the other hand different attenuated viruses such as mva bovine or attenuated hpiv-3 and adenovirus can be used as delivery systems for heterologous antigens 25 145  in fact mva has recently been exploited for antigens of the sars associated coronavirus 146  an alternative approach to the use of live attenuated carriers is given by the use of bacterial ghosts ghosts are generated by the conditional expression of the lethal lysis gene e from bacteriophage phix174 in gram-negative bacteria 147 148 149 150 151  this leads to the formation of a trans-membrane tunnel through the bacterial cellular envelope 147  due to the high internal osmotic pressure the cytoplasm content is expelled through the tunnel thereby leading to an empty bacterial cell envelope 152  the presence of envelope components in the ghosts provides a strong danger signal through the activation of pattern recognition receptors 153  in addition bacterial ghosts are efficiently taken up by antigen-presenting cells stimulating their maturation and activation 154  bacterial ghosts retain all morphological structural and antigenic features of the cell wall and can be used as vaccine candidates per se ghosts can also be externally loaded with purified antigens alternatively ghosts can be generated from recombinant bacteria expressing heterologous antigens hence avoiding the difficulties associated with the purification steps this technology also offers the possibility to manipulate the topology of the recombinant antigen eg the antigen can be bound to the inner membrane secreted into the periplasmic space or associated to the surface encouraging results has been obtained in preclinical models using ghosts expressing chlamydial antigens 135 155  promising results have been reported using different types of pseudoviruses such as virosomes and virus-like particles vlp which are non-replicating viral-like structures virosomes are based on the principle of reconstituting empty viral envelopes through integration of viral envelope proteins in liposomes they offer the versatility of liposomes in terms of lipid composition with the advantage of including viral membrane proteins virosomes are produced by disassembling the viral membrane envelope with detergents then the viral nucleocapsid is removed by ultracentrifugation before reconstitution fig 1  in contrast vlp exploit the capacity of recombinant viral coat proteins to spontaneously self-assemble thereby mimicking at structural level the viral capsid vlp can be isolated after protein expression in eukaryotic cells or by in vitro assemblage from subunits produced in an heterologous system 156  their main advantages are the lack the viral genetic material with an intact envelope and the fact that they are significantly more immunogenic than soluble proteins they can be used as vaccines per se as well as a delivery system for protein-or nucleic acid based vaccines or as carriers for small molecules foreign antigens can be expressed on their surface or can be simply encapsulated in addition amphiphilic adjuvants can be incorporated into their membranes thereby offering the advantage of combining an adjuvant and the antigen in one entity without a covalent attachment pseudoviruses are especially attractive for mucosal vaccination protocols since they offer the opportunity to use the natural route of transmission of the agents induction of serum antibodies secretory iga t helper and ctl responses and protection against mucosal pathogen challenge has been reported from studies in animals and humans 157 158 159  the virosomes generated using the influenza virus retain membrane fusion properties very similar to the nave virus therefore they are able to deliver material to the cytosol of target cells offering the possibility to access the mhc class i-restricted pathway of antigen presentation to prime ctl activity 160 161 162   bacterial toxins and their derivatives are among the first molecules that have been used as mucosal adjuvants they are characterized by the presence of an a moiety with enzymatic activity and a b moiety that mediates toxin binding to the target cells cholera toxin and the closely related escherichia coli heat-labile toxin showed potent adjuvant activity when co-administrated with different antigens by the mucosal route 163 164 165  however their use in humans is hampered by their intrinsic toxicity thus mutated derivatives were developed in which the a subunit was modified to remove the adp-ribosylating activity the resulting polypeptides retain their adjuvanticity in the absence of detectable toxicity 166 167 168  however additional studies have demonstrated that even these derivatives can lead to potential severe side-effects such as retrograde homing of adjuvant and antigen to neural tissues 169  this might explain at least in part the side-effects observed after intranasal vaccination against influenza with a virosomes-based formulation containing heat-labile toxin ie bells palsy which in turn led to its retraction from the market however chimeric derivatives lacking the targeting moiety for neural tissues ie b subunit are now available 170  they might allow the exploitation of the high potential of these molecules for the development of vaccines against respiratory pathogens in fact preclinical studies provided the proof-of-concept for the usefulness of derivatives of bacterial toxins in the generation of acellular vaccines against microorganisms such as s pneumonia and h influenzae 171 172  other bacterial components were also explored for their activity as adjuvants the monophosphoryl lipid a retains much of the immune stimulatory properties of lps without the inherent toxicity 165  on the other hand extracellular matrix binding proteins such as the fibronectin binding protein i of streptococcus pyogenes also exhibit adjuvant activity 173  this offers the possibility of using them as dual antigenadjuvant moieties in the same formulation recent reports also demonstrate that vaccine formulations containing adamantylamide dipeptide a non-toxic compound obtained by linking the l-alanine-d-isoglutamine residue of the muramyl dipeptide to the antiviral drug amantadine confer protection against non typeable h influenzae in preclinical models 73  the innate immune system plays a critical early role in host defence against pathogenic microorganisms through the recognition of pathogenassociated molecular patterns 174  this is achieved through the stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors prr that sense a broad range of exogenous and endogenous danger signals 153 174  toll-like receptors tlr represent the best-characterized family of prr natural and synthetic tlr agonists are being used as immune modulators to optimize responses after vaccination since the identification of the tlr4 many mammalian tlr homologues have been identified ie 10 in humans and 13 in mice 175  each tlr member binds specifically to different ligands tab 2 alone or in combinations eg heterodimers formed by tlr2 with either tlr1 or tlr6 an example of tlr agonist is bacterial dna but not vertebrate dna and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated cpg motifs they act on tlr9 thereby inducing a strong th1 responses by activation of dendritic cells 176 177  cpg motifs have been successfully used as adjuvants in preclinical studies of different candidate vaccines against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia 178 179 180  another important adjuvant with tlr-binding capacities is the mycoplasma-derived macrophage-activating lipopeptide malp-2 which act a the level of the tlr heterodimer 26 181 182  malp-2 promotes a global activation of cells from the innate and adaptive immune system 183 184  such as macrophages dc t-and b-lymphocytes 183 185  when coadministered with an antigen by either the parenteral or the mucosal route malp-2 promotes the elicitation of humoral and cellular responses at systemic and mucosal level 186  preclinical studies suggested that malp-2 could be exploited in vaccine formulations against the sars-associated coronavirus m catarrhalis and influenza virus among others unpublished data  dna vaccination offers some advantage over the normal antigen vaccination such as the fact that it is not necessary to express any antigen in contrast it is the biosynthetic machinery present in the cells of the vaccinees that takes care of this work furthermore since eukaryotic cells are in charge of protein synthesis their glycosylation and folding are optimal however the large-scale purification of dna might be associated with high costs this can be solved by the use of attenuated or inactivated bacteria or viruses as delivery systems 187  this approach can also lead to an enhanced induction of antibodies which is otherwise poor using conventional naked dna vaccines we have recently demonstrated that bacterial ghosts can be also exploited as a delivery system for dna vaccines for both in vivo and ex vivo applications 188  the potential of this approach is demonstrated by the fact that it is possible to optimize performance by a broad range of manipulations such as i choice of optimal promoters ii use of codon optimized genes for expression in mammalian cells iii addition of nuclear localization signals or ubiquitination signals to improve expression and processing and iv co-delivery of dna constructs coding for immune modulatory molecules 189  in addition by the presence of immune stimulatory cpg motifs the dna vaccine constructs has built-in adjuvant properties this vaccination approach is particularly suited for the stimulation of cellular immune responses 190  interestingly several reports suggest that dna vaccines may represent a valid alternative to prime the neonatal immune system even in the presence of passive transferred maternal antibodies 191 192  in fact promising results were also obtained in preclinical models of community-acquired pneumonia such as influenza 193 and s pneumoniae 194  furthermore dna coding for vaccine antigens appears to induce excellent immunological memory which can be reawakened by later immunization or exposure to the pathogen the knowledge generated in several basic disciplines such as immunology and microbial pathogenesis has allowed the identification of critical bottlenecks for establishing a successful vaccination strategy it is expected that in the coming years we will develop customized approaches to address each of them in order to stimulate efficient protection against infective agents under specific clinical settings ie newborns aging individuals immunocompromised patients the importance of immunological memory b lymphocytes that have differentiated into plasma cells are the producers of antigen-specific igg antibodies bone-marrow bm plasma cells have a short life therefore the bm reservoir needs to be replenished by the stimulation of memory b cells 195 196  the maximal life span of bm plasma cells is still debated only few factors have been identified that control the differentiation of antigen-specific b cells toward short-or long-life plasma cells or to memory b cells 119  beside the requirement of cd4  t cells the nature of the antigen 197 and the dose are also important higher antigen doses as well as rapid vaccination schedules closely spaced vaccine doses tend to favour the rapid induction of short-term effectors whereas lower doses of antigens preferentially support the induction of immune memory 198 199 200 201  it was demonstrated that neonatal vaccination priming and infant boosting might be effective even when pathogen exposure occurs very early in life in children in whom vaccine-induced hib antibody titres have fallen to undetectable levels memory is readily demonstrated 202  however immune memory per se is not enough to protect against pathogens that required high levels of neutralizing antibodies the delay between memory b-cell reactivation and differentiation may limit the ability to interrupt pathogen invasion therefore it is important to establish vaccination protocols in which the population is boosted at different ages in order to maintain the required levels of antibodies this is particularly important in diseases in which antibodies play a central role in microbial clearance or toxin neutralization in the particular case of community-acquired pneumonia we should consider that aging individuals are neglected in many vaccination programs however the strategies proposed for elderly would be different from those used for small children since the main factors affecting vaccine efficacy are immune senescence and immaturity respectively the attempts to give a rational solution to this issue are discussed in the next sections the immune system in children immune responses to bacterial and viral antigens usually increase with age in a stepwise manner 203  prompt immunization after birth is required to induce active immunity against diseases that may occur early in life unfortunately this strategy is limited by the relative immaturity of the neonatal and infant immune system some factors implicated in this poor response are the limited switch from igm to igg2 antibodies impaired complement-mediated reactions and deficient organization of the splenic marginal zone vaccination studies performed in newborn mice suggested that limited germinal centre reactions may results from the delayed devel-opment of follicular dc and limit plasma cell differentiation 204  it was also showed that the neonatal bm has a limited capacity to support the establishment of long-life antibody-secreting plasma cells 205  thus the responses to glyco-conjugates and to most t-cell-dependent antigens are usually affected 119  therefore only few and highly immunogenic vaccines show significant protective efficacy after a single dose in infants the limited igg responses are extended all over the first year of life in addition the immune responses particularly antibodies elicited in the first year of life after vaccination rapidly decline 203  however the problem observed in infants in terms of magnitude and duration of immune response does not seem to affect efficient priming in fact the immune memory generated in neonates may be recalled later in life 119  nevertheless strategies to generate strong and long-lasting protective responses in infants are still needed this is in part due to the presence of maternal antibodies which inactivate and clear the vaccine antigens thereby rendering difficult the stimulation of an immature immune system 203  in addition the effects of adjuvants reported in adults cannot be extrapolated to neonates 206  a potential strategy to overcome these problems would be to implement vaccination during pregnancy to provide the required antibodies by placenta and later by maternal feeding 30 207 208 209  this could be complemented with an early priming of the immature immune system of the newborn by dna vaccination followed by a boost during the second half of the first year or later in life 203  poly-pathology and multiple organ failure is the rule rather than the exception in aging individuals thus many systems are affected eg endocrine cardiovascular and the immune system is not an exception the mechanisms involved in the immune senescence process which in turn may lead to poor response to vaccination are not fully understood however it is clear that responses against certain vaccines are more affected by immune senescence than others eg ps-based vaccines against s pneumoniae 210  in contrast the responses to a boost dose of the anti-tetanus vaccine are hardly affected by age 211  a rapid decline of antibody responses together with a relative restriction of the t-cell repertoire is characteristic of the immune senescence process this restriction and the reduction in the pool of nave cells can explain the poor cd4  t cell responses against antigens that are cross-reacting with proteins which were seen earlier in life in contrast t-cells responses of healthy elderly individuals to new antigens are often unaffected nevertheless the overall response to vaccination in the elderly is less efficient than in young adults making more vigorous approaches necessary fig 2  in the case of influenza the actual strategy is annual re-vaccination however there are concerns regarding the capacity to increase antibodies with proper specificity against re-assorted viruses in aging adults who have been repeatedly infected or immunized after exposure to a new but cross-reacting antigenic variant such individuals may respond by producing antibodies however these antibodies could be primarily directed against influenza strains which were encountered earlier in life figure 2  factors affecting the responses in young adults and aging individuals after vaccination the process of immune senescence impairs host response to both infection and vaccination this critical issue needs to be considered during vaccine design and will require the development of special approaches for example individuals previously exposed to the old h1n1 influenza strain ie 50 years ago may respond differently from nave adults who are vaccinated with a new h1n1 strain which have accumulated different mutations the former might produce antibodies against the ha of the old h1n1 strain rather than to the cross-reacting epitopes of the new strain 212  this is phenomenon is the so-called original antigenic sin 119  on the basis of this observations it was proposed that variations in vaccine efficacy might be due to differences in the antigenic distance between the vaccine strains and the epidemic strains responsible for influenza outbreaks 213  however this hypothesis was not confirmed by epidemiologic studies 214  even more individuals aged 65 years or older who were annually vaccinated showed a significantly reduced mortality risk therefore until now it seems that the antigenic sin does not represent a major practical obstacle in influenza vaccination and additional strategies may not be required despite the broad availability of vaccines against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia they still represent an important cause of death human suffering and economic losses however we have dramatically expanded our knowledge on the pathophysiology of diseases caused by respiratory pathogens their virulence factors and the effector mechanisms responsible for their clearance it is becoming clearer which microbial components are attractive as vaccine targets as well as the type of immune response needed to confer protection against disease thus it is now possible to address vaccine development using rational rather than empiric approaches this is facilitated by powerful bioinformatics tools for the accurate prediction of epitopes and proteasome trimming 215 216 217  as well as by the availability of a broad palette of immune modulators and delivery systems therefore we can predict that new and improved vaccines against the etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonia will considerably reduce the global impact of this disease in the coming years   a subcutaneously injected uv-inactivated sars coronavirus vaccine elicits systemic humoral immunity in mice naomi takasuka hideki fujii yoshimasa takahashi masataka kasai shigeru morikawa shigeyuki itamura koji ishii masahiro sakaguchi kazuo ohnishi masamichi ohshima shu-ichi hashimoto takato odagiri masato tashiro hiroshi yoshikura toshitada takemori yasuko tsunetsugu-yokota   a new disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome sars originated in china in late 2002 and spread rapidly to many countries upon this outbreak a global collaboration network was coordinated by who as a result of this unprecedented international effort a novel type of coronavirus sars-cov was identified as the etiologic agent of sars 12 in march 2003 the genomic sequence of sars-cov was completed and we now know that sars-cov has all the features and characteristics of other coronaviruses but it is quite different from all previously known coronaviruses groups iiii representing a new group group iv 34 it is assumed that sars-cov is a mutant coronavirus transmitted from a wild animal that developed the ability to productively infect humans 35 the genome of sars-cov is a single-stranded plus-sense rna 30 kb in length and containing five major open reading frames that encode non-structural replicase polyproteins and structural proteins the spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid protein n in the same order and of approximately the same sizes as those of other coronaviruses 5 the reason why sars-cov induces severe respiratory distress in some but not all infected individuals is still unclear in patients with sars and probable sars cases virus is detected in sputum stool and plasma by rtpcr 12 these patients developed serum antibodies against sars-cov and high antibody titers against n protein were maintained for more than 5 months after infection 6 because of their generally poor pathogenicity and difficulty of propagation in vitro there have been few studies regarding immunity to human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e in the veterinary field however coronaviruses have been known for many years to cause a variety of lung liver and gut diseases in animals as we learned from these animal models both humoral and cellular immune responses may contribute to protection against coronavirus diseases including sars for review see 7 the clinical manifestation of sars is hardly distinct from other common respiratory viral infections including influenza because an influenza epidemic may occur simultaneously with the re-emergence of sars it is urgently required that we develop effective sars vaccines as well as sensitive diagnostic tests specific for sars recently the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was identified as a cellular receptor for sars-cov 8 the first step in viral infection is presumably the binding of s protein to its receptor ace2 in the murine mhv model s proteins are known to contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibodies in mice 910 therefore the s protein would be the first candidate coronavirus protein for induction of immunity however the s m and n proteins are also known to contribute to generating the host immune response 1112 following an established vaccine protocol is one of the best ways to shorten the time and cost of new vaccine development most of the currently available vaccines for humans are inactivated and applied cutaneously except oral polio vaccine and adjuvant usage is mostly limited to aluminum hydroxide gel alum in order to know the immunogenicity of inactivated sars-cov as a vaccine candidate we immunized mice with uv-inactivated sars-cov either with or without alum we report here the evaluation of humoral and cellular immunity elicited by uv-inactivated sars-cov administered subcutaneously sars-cov hku39849 was kindly supplied by dr jsm peiris department of microbiology the university of hong kong the virus was amplified in vero e6 cells and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation concentrated virus was then exposed to uv light 475 jcm2 in order to inactivate the virus we confirmed that

the level of anti-sars-cov response in mice after inoculation with vaccine candidates three mice in each group were subcutaneously inoculated with 10 g of uv-inactivated purified sars-cov with virionalum or without alum virion or inoculated with alum alone alum or left untreated none as a control fig 1 one month after inoculation vaccinated mice elicited the anti-sars cov igg antibody in sera at high levels as expected the alum adjuvant enhanced the level of igg antibody response 10-fold higher than the level without adjuvant fig 1c compared with b when mice were boosted at 7 weeks the level of igg antibody in both groups of mice was further increased 10-fold above the primary response fig 1b and c notably the level of serum antibodies induced by a single injection of virion even in the absence of the alum adjuvant was maintained at least more than 6 months fig 1d these results suggest that long-term ascs can be established by a single shot of uv-inactivated virion administration upon restimulation with antigen memory b cells rapidly differentiate into ascs and migrate into the bone marrow to establish a long-term asc pool 1516 to enumerate the number of plasma cells specific for sars-cov we performed an elispot assay using recombinant n proteins amino acid numbers 149 n149 and 340390 n340390 as coating antigens consistent with the serum anti-sars cov igg level sars-specific igg1 plasma cells were maintained in the bone marrow at day 10 after boost immunization with virionalum fig 2 in contrast the number of spots from control mice was below the detection limit ie 1 asc9  105 cells we determined the subclass of serum anti-sars-cov igg antibodies in the boosted mice using anti-mouse igg1 igg2a igg2b or igg3 second antibody by elisa fig 3 interestingly the level of anti-sars-cov igg2a in mice immunized with virionalum was comparable to that in mice immunized with virion alone whereas the level of anti-sars-cov igg1 was higher in mice with virionalum than the mice with virion alone in contrast the levels of igg2b and igg3 antibodies were fairly low in both groups therefore our results indicated that vaccination with a combination of inactivated virion and alum induced a predominantly th2-type immune response we also measured serum immunoglobulins other than igg in the early and late phases of immunization to avoid high igg concentrations interfering with the detection of igm and iga antibodies the serum igg was absorbed with protein g-conjugated beads 98 the levels of anti-sars-cov igm antibodies in the igg-depleted sera which were obtained 4 weeks after priming were below our detection limit likewise anti-sars-cov iga antibody in the igg-depleted sera which were obtained 1 week after booster was not detectable data not shown whether or not immune sera possess a neutralizing activity against sars-cov is a crucial aspect of vaccination we estimated the neutralizing activity of sera obtained 1 week after boost inoculation table 1 we observed that neutralizing activity against sars-cov was detected at a high level in sera of mice inoculated with virionalum or virion alone taken together these results indicate that subcutaneous vaccination with uv-inactivated sars-cov virion is able to elicit a sufficient amount of igg antibodies with neutralizing activity using the immune sera of mice boosted with virionalum 1 week before we analyzed the specificity of serum igg by western blot analysis see methods as shown in fig 4a the robust signal detected at 50 kda corresponds to the n protein of sars-cov as predicted by its genome size 34 a band near 200 kda appears to correspond to s protein analogous with the s protein of other human coronaviruses hcv-229e and hcv-oc43 which are known to be heavily glycosylated and detected at 186 kda and 190 kda respectively 17 our result is consistent with the data reported recently by xiao et al who expressed the full-length s glycoprotein of sars-cov tor2 strain in 293 cells and showed that the protein ran 180200 kda in sds gels 18 the origins of the 120 kda and the faint 37 kda bands were unknown however similar bands were also detected on a fluorogram by using anti-n mabs ohnishi k sakaguchi m takasuka n et al unpublished data suggesting that it is related to n protein the specificity of igg in the immune sera was also determined by elisa plates coated with lysates of cells infected with either s- or n-expressing recombinant vaccinia viruses fig 4b the results indicated that anti-s as well as anti-n protein igg antibodies were elicited by virionalum vaccination to examine whether or not subcutaneously vaccinated mice gained an induced t-cell response against sars-cov mice were immunized either with virionalum virion or alum only via the footpad t cells of these mice were enriched from the spleen and regional lymph nodes 1 week after a booster immunization and cultured with irradiated apcs in the presence or absence of uv-inactivated sars-cov virion at 1 or 10 gml as shown in fig 5a regional lymph node t cells proliferated in vitro in response to uv-inactivated virion in virionalum-immunized mice and to a lesser extent in virion-immunized mice because mice inoculated with virionalum showed a high basal level of proliferation of lymph node t cells in the absence of antigen there is not much difference in the net proliferative response of these cells between the virionalum group and the virion only group on the other hand in splenic t cells a low level of proliferation was observed only in the virionalum group of mice the level of proliferation of these t cells however was virion-dose independent therefore our results suggest that the subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion even without alum does induce t cell activation to some extent in the draining lymph node a result which hardly occurs systemically we also measured the level of cytokine production in the supernatant of lymph node t cells stimulated with inactivated virion in vitro for 4 days we found that the inactivated virion induced the production of all the cytokines il-2 il-4 il-5 ifn- and tnf- in t cells of virionalum-immunized mice in a dose-dependent manner fig 5b likewise t cells of virion-immunized mice produced low yet significant levels of these cytokines in a dose-dependent manner except il-5 in contrast lymph node t cells from normal mice did not produce any cytokines at all in response to virion suggesting that the virion itself does not possess innate stimulating activity as bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide lps and purified protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis ppd do taken together these results suggest that subcutaneous vaccination with uv-inactivated sars-cov is able to activate cd4 t cells in regional lymph nodes where t cells produce several immunoregulatory cytokines including ifn- the present results demonstrated that even a single subcutaneous administration of uv-irradiated virion without alum adjuvant induced a high level of systemic anti-sars-cov antibody response in mice probably followed by the generation of long-term antibody-secreting cells and memory cells in the bone marrow considering that polyvalent particulate structures such as hepatitis b virus surface antigen-based hiv-1 gag-based and ty virus-like particles have been shown to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune responses 19 these particulates probably have comparable dimensions and structures to the pathogens that are targeted for uptake by apcs to facilitate the induction of potent immune responses the antibodies elicited in mice vaccinated by the current protocol with or without adjuvant recognized both the s and n proteins of sars-cov and were able to neutralize the infection of virus to vero e6 cells however serum anti-sars-cov iga antibody was not detectable probably owing to the route of vaccination in addition the present vaccination protocol caused t cell response at the regional lymph nodes although it did not allow for the induction of a sufficient cellular immune response systemically we show here the potentiality of subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion with alum which is utilized for most of current human vaccinations alum has been used as an adjuvant for vaccines such as diphtheria pertussis and tetanus and these vaccines have a long safety record for human use 20 we observed that the addition of alum to the vaccine formula resulted in a large augmentation of serum igg1 production but not igg2a production the level of igg1 in alum-vaccinated mice reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice which were subcutaneously injected with 5 g of inactivated virion emulsified with a complete freund adjuvant followed by consecutive three-times intravenous boosters with 2 g of virion alum is known to selectively stimulate an igg1 dominant type 2 immune response reviewed in 21 activation of complement by alum could contribute to the type 2-biased immune response partly via an inhibition of il-12 production interestingly a quite recent report demonstrated that an alum-induced gr1 myeloid cell population produced il-4 and activated b-cells 22 there are various diseases associated with animal coronavirus infection the clinical manifestations of the disease and the correlates of protection with immunity have been studied extensively in these animal coronavirus infections reviewed in 7 although antibodies and t cells may play a role in exacerbating the pathology in some animal coronavirus infections 2324 both humoral and cellular immune responses are known to contribute to protection against coronavirus infection in murine hepatitis virus a group 2 coronavirus the mortality of susceptible mice was partially prevented by the transfer of immune serum containing neutralizing antibody prior to challenge 25 recently zhi-yong et al reported in the murine acute infection model that the neutralizing antibody elicited by vaccination of dna encoding s was protective but cellular components of vaccinated mice were not required for the inhibition of viral replication 26 because a twice parenteral administration of inactivated virion with alum induced a high level of antibodies that are able to neutralize sars-cov this vaccination protocol may have a certain effect on the protection of humans from sars-cov infection we observed that two successive inoculations with inactivated virus at 7 week intervals generated sars-cov-specific t cells these cells were restimulated with the irradiated virus in vitro but their response was low in terms of the level of proliferation and production of inf- and il-2 however irrespective of vaccination protocols with or without alum adjuvant virus-primed t cells of vaccinated animals were capable of producing il-4 at high levels upon in vitro stimulation comparable to other reports for a variety of vaccination studies 2728 this outlook seems compatible with the idea that the present vaccine protocol may tend to select t-cell subsets with th2 phenotype however it remains to be elucidated whether such t cells may exhibit serological memory phenotype and persist in the immune system after vaccination as long as memory b cells which may persist more than 180 days post vaccination in addition further analysis is needed to clarify whether t cell response is a crucial factor for long-term protection against sars-cov infections efforts to develop a sars-cov vaccine have been carried out by many profitable or non-profitable organizations in various ways for example it has recently been reported that the combination of adenovirus vector expressing sars-s -m or -n protein elicited a neutralizing capacity in serum and n-specific t-cell response in rhesus macaques 29 however it is still uncertain whether or not the immunity against only these components of sars-cov is sufficient for virus protection sars-cov tends to cause replication errors which may allow the virus to escape the host-immune response and result in a seasonal outbreak from this point of view it resembles influenza virus in influenza virus inactivated ha vaccine showed incomplete protection but had a certain efficacy and safety record for a long period of time indeed this approach has been used in the veterinary field such as with the bovine coronavirus 30 and canine coronavirus 31 these advantages make a whole killed virion a prime candidate for a sars vaccine even if it may not have the best protective ability unfortunately no information is available so far on the immune correlates of protection against human coronaviruses including sars-cov in consideration that sars-cov transmission occurs by direct contact with droplets or by the fecal oral route mucosal secretary iga in both the lower respiratory tract and digestive tract seem to be crucially important failure to induce iga-type antibodies in a current systemic vaccination method should be improved notably iga antibodies were detectable in the sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from mice hyper-immunized with uv-irradiated virus data not shown therefore if a non-toxic and more potent adjuvant becomes available for human use the subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion would become an effective vaccination method to reduce the number of susceptible people in the future it will be necessary to determine whether or not the inactivated whole virion vaccine possesses protective ability against sars-cov infection by the use of adequate animal models furthermore whether the alum addition augmented the protection and the effective period of sars-cov virion vaccination should be addressed because currently used inactivated influenza virus whole virion vaccine is significantly effective without any adjuvant meanwhile we also need to develop a potent adjuvant for induction of a much stronger mucosal immunity in addition to evaluating available methods of virion inactivation  rna virus reverse genetics and vaccine design christopher stobart c martin moore l   vaccines remain one of the greatest accomplishments of human ingenuity scientific endeavor and the combined global efforts of the public health community the rates of incidence and mortality associated with infection by rna viruses such as polio measles mumps and rubella have declined by greater than 95 compared to pre-vaccination rates 1 though highly successful in the past conventional approaches to rna virus vaccine development such as live-attenuation through passaging forward genetics or inactivation may be less efficient for generating good candidates than rational targeted mutagenesis reverse genetics advancements in recombinant dna technology and virus reverse genetics have provided key critical insights into the replication and pathogenesis of rna viruses and facilitate vaccine development through targeted modifications and directed attenuation the advent of reverse genetics and molecular engineering of viruses has transformed the field of virology by permitting study of targeted genetic changes in virus genomes in 1981 the first infectious rna virus clone was isolated from cdna to generate poliovirus 2 since then reverse genetics technology and recombinant virus design has been employed to generate reverse genetic clones representing all major virus families in addition these techniques and approaches have now become the focus of new efforts to design vaccines that incorporate specific changes in either component-based or virus-based systems to induce lasting immunity in the host without health risks or deleterious effects  since the development of effective live-attenuated vaccines new vaccine preparations utilizing well-established vectors expression of specific viral proteins or components subunit vaccines and development of virus-like particles vlps have continued to shape the domain of vaccine discovery and development the challenge of establishing a safe immunogenic platform which induces lasting immunity in the context of a wide variety of viral systems has resulted in remarkable creativity and variability in the approaches employed use of replicating viruses in vaccines such as live-attenuated or chimeric vector-based platforms have the benefits of high immunogenicity lower costs and ease to transport and administer yet these viruses have the potential to revert to more pathogenic phenotypes and may be under-attenuated in immunocompromised hosts conversely component subunit or killed pathogen vaccines have the benefits of generally being safer and can be used to display the most immunogenic antigens however the costs time of development and weaker induced immune responses present their own challenges to design and implementation in this review we describe rna virus reverse genetics systems and provide an overview of current efforts to use reverse genetics technology in the development of safe and effective vaccines current rna virus reverse genetics systems make use of multiple common features of rna virus biology first rna viruses generate genomic copies through the activity of a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp in addition nearly all rna virus replication strategies are independent from the host cell nucleus and instead reside in the cytoplasm for positive-strand rna viruses such as poliovirus immediately after entry and uncoating the genomic rna is directly translated by host ribosomes to generate viral protein products since the virus rarely needs to package additional nonstructural proteins in the virion most positive-sense rna virus reverse genetics systems largely focus on delivery of either transcribed genomic rna into the cell cytoplasm or delivery of cdna under the control of a viral transcription promoter such as t7 or cmv figure 1 345678910 however negative-strand and double-strand rna virus reverse genetic systems often require the use of additional helper constructs to introduce the rdrp and other essential proteins to initiate genomic replication a recent alternative approach which has been employed in the field of influenza research is to synthesize viral rna and drive mrna production through the activity of the host polymerases such as pol i and pol ii 1112 this approach has simplified the logistics of plasmid transfection and increased the efficacy of recombinant virus recovery a similar approach has been successfully employed for recovery of an arenavirus lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus lcmv 13 one additional platform that has been employed for rna virus infectious clone generation is the bacterial artificial chromosome bac bac constructs are single-copy dna plasmids based on the f-plasmid of bacteria which are genetically stable in e coli and permit the insertion of large dna fragments to be transcribed under the control of a transcriptional promoter such as t7 bac constructs have been employed for many years in the recovery of large dna viruses however the genetic stability of these constructs has led to their use in recombinant rna virus platforms several positive-strand rna viruses and one negative-strand rna virus have used bacs as a platform for reverse genetic design table 1 since most rna virus replication strategies are segregated from the host genome and replication machinery few rna viruses modify host gene expression and cause oncogenesis as a result rna reverse genetic systems do not typically have to account for the potential transformation of host cells lastly most rna viruses are limited to small genome sizes with the majority smaller than 15 kb due to reduced genomic stability and the lowered fidelity of the viral rdrp subsequently reverse genetic approaches often employ the use of cdna genetic clones for greater versatility in manipulation and modification of the virus genome  picornaviruses are a family of non-enveloped positive-strand rna viruses which collectively infect a wide range of human and animal hosts human picornaviral pathogens cause illnesses which vary from the common cold to poliomyelitis the picornavirus virion consists of an icosahedral capsid structure surrounding an rna genome ranging from approximately 7 to 9 kb in size poliovirus and rhinovirus remain two of the most extensively studied picornaviruses to date and have become model systems for the study of rna virus biology pathogenesis and epidemiology during the 1950s extensive efforts began to develop and implement a polio vaccine in the hopes to eradicate the virus since no non-human primate reservoirs are known to exist in nature the effectiveness of the inactivated salk vaccine and live-attenuated sabin vaccines led to increased efforts to develop and design vaccines for many other human pathogens international vaccination efforts are aimed at eradicating the disease the success and employed strategies for implementation of vaccines for poliovirus opened the door to evaluating new approaches and efforts to study and understand rna virus biology a major step occurred in 1981 when racaniello and baltimore introduced a full-length cdna clone of poliovirus into a cell and recovered infectious virus 2 although initially the mechanism by which a cdna clone in a plasmid could give rise to productive rna virus infection was unknown the cdna platform approach used by racaniello and baltimore was rapidly adapted to develop similar reverse genetics systems for a number of picornaviruses including coxsackie b virus 24 rhinovirus 25 hepatitis a virus 26 theilers virus 27 foot and mouth disease virus 28 swine vesicular disease virus 29 and two echoviruses 3031 advances in the understanding and engineering of plasmids for gene delivery led to more efficient cdna-based systems which represent the primary reverse genetics approaches used for recovery of picornaviruses today  no commercially available rhinovirus vaccines exist today despite effective reverse genetics platforms for several serotypes rhinoviruses remain the primary cause of the common cold worldwide and have been extensively studied for over 50 years yet the great puzzle of developing a broadly protective rhinovirus vaccine involves solving the overwhelming task of developing an immunogenic platform which can provide protective immunity to the greater than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus that currently circulate in nature 3233 the capsid of rhinovirus is comprised of four distinct serotype-specific proteins vp1 vp2 vp3 and vp4 which are known to be immunogenic and potentially elicit cross-reactive antibodies 32343536 yet development of broadly-neutralizing rhinovirus protection will likely require the formulation of a polyvalent vaccine which includes incorporation of several serotype variants of the immunogenic capsid proteins 36 efforts at designing polyvalent rhinovirus vaccine formulations have yet to provide the broad immunogenic memory necessary to be effective however regions of vp0 precursor of vp2 and vp4 have been shown to be conserved across a and b group rhinoviruses and combination with a th1 promoting adjuvant induced a crossserotype immune response in mice 34 the discovery of conserved epitopes and recent development of chimeric or new reverse genetics platforms including a mouse model of infection may provide a novel avenue to the efficient display of epitopes from the breadth of rhinovirus diversity 373839 coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand rna viruses which encode the largest known rna virus genomes varying in size from 26 to 32 kb 40 coronavirus infections in humans are associated with upper and lower respiratory illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars over the last 12 years four new human coronaviruses have been identified including sars coronavirus and the recent middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus 41 despite a high clinical and economic burden and potential for emerging infectious disease no commercially available vaccines currently exist  there are currently two common platforms that are used for generating full-length infectious coronavirus clones the first platform involves in vitro transcription and capping of a full-length cdna clone of the coronavirus genome followed by introduction into competent cells by either transfection or electroporation the coronavirus genome which is approximately 30 kb in size is often maintained as fragments in low-copy plasmids during virus assembly the fragments are restriction digested and ligated together prior to transcription this approach has been successfully used to recover clones of many coronaviruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev 8 murine hepatitis virus mhv 10 nl63 42 sars coronavirus 9 sars-like bat coronaviruses 43 and mers coronavirus 5 another common platform utilizes existing bac technology the coronavirus genome is introduced into a bac construct under the control of a cmv promoter this approach has been successfully used to recover clones of human viruses oc43 and mers coronavirus 316 both of these approaches yield productive infections and high titers of progeny virus a third approach involving a vaccinia vector platform has also been used successfully for the production of human 229e infectious clones 7 efforts to design a coronavirus vaccine have focused on a variety of approaches including development of inactivated virus live-attenuated virus and a variety of subunit vaccines one major focus of current coronavirus vaccine efforts is focusing on ways to create a live-attenuated vaccine strain which combines existing treatments with a less virulent and more stable virus platform during the sars epidemic patients showed little improvement when treated with ribavirin recent studies have shown that coronaviruses are resistant to ribavirin treatment due to the presence of a viral exonuclease nsp14 with proofreading activity 4445 additionally deletion of the exonuclease proofreading activity results in a hypermutation phenotype that appears genetically stable and induces protection in murine models 464748 the recent outbreak of mers-cov has triggered a demand for the development of a mers vaccine 49 several approaches are being explored including identifying effective neutralizing antibodies use of the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein as a component to induce immunity and direct changes to recombinant mers-cov 3505152 the availability of effective reverse genetics platforms for coronaviruses associated with high mortality viruses such as sars and mers coronaviruses and the potential for low cost for development and implementation provide promise for creating an effective vaccine platform  flaviviruses are small enveloped positive-strand rna viruses that infect a wide range of hosts flavivirus genomes are markedly smaller than coronaviruses at approximately 1012 kb in size and the transmission of most flaviviruses is dependent upon an arthropod vector hence their common name arboviruses flavivirus diseases range from asymptomatic to severe neurological disease such as encephalitis meningitis and myelitis 53 yellow fever virus yfv a deadly flavivirus associated with over 30000 deaths annually who was identified in 1901 by walter reed and was the first human viral pathogen ever discovered 545556 outbreaks and disease connected to flaviviruses have stressed the importance of developing reverse genetic platforms and efficacious vaccines similar to picornaviruses nearly all flavivirus reverse genetics platforms involve either in vitro transcription of full-length or ligated cdna fragments of the genome or use a bacterial artificial chromosome bac platform table 1 and are subsequently transfected or electroporated into competent cells reverse genetics platforms have been developed for a wide range of flaviviruses including yfv 5758 dengue types 14 5960616263646566 jev 67 kunjin virus 68 tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev 697071 murray valley encephalitis virus 72 langat virus 73 west nile virus wnv 674 and omsk hemorrhagic fever virus 75 advances in the recombinant flavivirus approaches have been instrumental in new vaccine design efforts  some of the first vaccine efforts were directed at generating inactivated or live-attenuated strains for vaccinations against flaviviruses in 1937 max theiler developed a safe yfv live-attenuated vaccine called 17d through the use of a serial passaged virus originally isolated from an african patient 76 the vaccine composition used today remains largely the same as that first developed over 70 years ago and provides protective immunity for over 30 years 777879 jev was first isolated and studied in the 1930s and an inactivated vaccine derived from a mouse brain was first developed in japan in 1954 5380 the current formulations of the jev vaccines include inactivated beijing-1 strain or liveattenuated strains which elicit greater immunogenicity and broader protection than the original nakayama strain 53 despite the success of vaccine development for yfv and jev unique challenges have been presented in developing vaccines to some well-known flaviviruses such as dengue virus and new emerging flaviviruses such as wnv  dengue virus is endemic to tropical and subtropical locations worldwide to date five distinct serotypes of dengue virus are known including a new serotype identified in 2013 5381 infection with one serotype increases the severity of disease upon a secondary infection with a different serotype 82 consequently any dengue virus vaccine must either provide protection to all extent serotypes to prevent priming for increased disease by a heterotypic infection or remove the immunogenic components of the virus that cause increased disease severity upon heterotypic infections efforts to develop stable chimeric platforms for the development of dengue virus vaccines have recently been focused on expressing dengue virus surface proteins in chimeric viruses with other more stable flaviviruses such as yfv 838485 one vaccine candidate is a tetravalent vaccine from sanofi pasteur which involves the formation of a chimeric yfv strain 17d virus containing the prme genes of each dengue serotype 85 this approach has also recently been adapted to develop similar vaccine candidates to the recently identified wnv 8586 despite several commercially available wnv vaccines for veterinary purposes there remains no approved wnv vaccine for humans the future licensure of dengue and wnv vaccines will likely continue to focus on development of liveattenuated or inactivated virus models of vaccination due to the high immunogenicity of flavivirus infections paramyxoviruses are enveloped negative-sense single-strand rna viruses which are responsible for a variety of human and animal diseases human paramyxoviruses have been identified which are responsible for diseases including measles mumps pneumonia and the common cold paramyxoviruses carry a single copy of their genome which is typically 15 to 19 kb in length like other negative-strand rna viruses paramyxoviruses must incorporate their replication machinery including the rdrp into the virion during assembly paramyxovirus reverse genetic systems employ very similar mechanisms first the full-length genome or antigenome and helper plasmids expressing nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins are cloned as cdna and are under transcriptional control by a promoter such as t7 rna polymerase the plasmids are co-transfected into permissive cell lines earlier reverse genetics systems utilized a co-infection approach with a vaccinia virus expressing t7 however most modern reverse genetics systems use a t7 cell line or transfect a t7 plasmid recently the first bac-based reverse genetics system for a negative-strand rna virus was developed for respiratory syncytial virus rsv 21 reverse genetics systems for many paramyxoviruses have been generated including measles virus 89 mumps virus 90 hendra virus 91 nipah virus 92 rsv 2193 despite the availability of reverse genetics systems development of paramyxovirus vaccines has been met with variable success  the first paramyxovirus vaccine was developed during the 1950s john enders was able to develop a cultivation system for measles virus and cultured an attenuated measles virus called the edmonston strain named after the child from which it was isolated the edmonston strain though initially underattenuated was later adapted and led to the successfully license of a measles vaccine in 1963 94 maurice hilleman was able to build on the success of the live-attenuated measles vaccine and cultured and adapted by passage in fertilized hens eggs a strain of mumps called jeryl lynn named after his daughter from whom it was isolated 95 hilleman was later instrumental in the development of the mmr vaccine combining live-attenuated strains of measles mumps rubella wistar ra 273 strain which was first licensed for use in 1971 96 the early success of the measles and mumps vaccines prompted renewed efforts to develop vaccines to other pathogenic rna viruses one of the greatest challenges to viral vaccine design remains the development of a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus rsv  respiratory syncytial virus rsv was first isolated in 1955 from a chimpanzee displaying upper respiratory illness 97 since its identification rsv has become recognized as the leading cause of infant mortality by a virus worldwide 9899 in the united states alone rsv upper and lower respiratory infections have led to over 100000 hospitalizations annually 9899100 despite a high clinical burden no licensed rsv vaccines are available and current treatments are cost prohibitive while only providing passive immunity by administration of prophylactic antibodies 101102103 the most susceptible population for rsv infection is young infants 9899100 consequently the ideal rsv vaccine must be immunogenic genetically stable and safe for vaccination in infants however an early tragic failure during the 1960s of a formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine has dampened efforts to develop and implement new vaccines 104105 to date the most clinically advanced rsv vaccine candidates have been live-attenuated viruses developed through virus passage and reconstitution by reverse genetics 106107108 one of the more promising of these candidates to date has been medi559 which includes many introduced mutations which render the virus temperature-sensitive and provides some level of protection 106107 however these candidates have not been able to achieve the level of protection and genetic stability necessary for implementation 109 ongoing studies continue to evaluate new targets for attenuation however successful development of an rsv vaccine will require finding the proper balance of attenuation and immunogenicity orthomyxoviruses are enveloped negative-sense rna viruses whose genomes consist of multiple linear segments and are approximately 12 to 15 kb in size similar to paramyxoviruses many orthomyxoviruses cause respiratory illnesses in humans most notable is influenza flu a key hallmark of orthoymyxovirus evolution is the reassortment of the virus genomes through co-infection of a cell in order to be transcriptionally active influenza viruses require a functionally active viral ribonucleoprotein complex rnp which consists of the viral genomic rna nucleoprotein np and the viral rdrp comprised of pb1 pb2 and pa proteins 110 the first reverse genetics approaches developed for orthomyxoviruses were generated for influenza a virus iav however these systems utilized helper viruses that had to be selected against to recover recombinants 111112 the first helper virus-free systems were developed around the turn of the millennium 113114 these first systems required the co-transfection of four or more plasmids under the control of a pol ii promoter as well as eight plasmids expressing the eight viral rna segments the number of plasmids cotransfected for recovery varied greatly depending upon the number of viral genomic segments and the organization of the helper protein constructs ranging from 10 which expressed two of the helper proteins on each of two plasmids using the pol ii promoter and an ires to as many as 17 113114115116117118 however recent advances in the reverse genetics platforms have reduced the number of total plasmids needed to 8 or less using a bidirectional expression system 1112 in this system a human pol i promoter coupled with either a murine poli terminator drives viral rna synthesis and a cmv pol ii promoter is responsible for viral mrna synthesis 11 this improved production of iav however generation of recombinant virus for vaccines is limited to a select number of mammalian cell lines such as african green monkey kidney epithelial cells vero or madin darby canine kidney mdck cells 119120 however these cell lines had limited transfectability and differences in pol i and pol ii compatibility have hindered the efficacy of these uni- and bidirectional approaches incorporation of species-specific polymerase promoters has provided improved efficacy of recovery in several of these cell lines 119120 a recent advancement has been the combination of up to 8 pol i driven iav genes on a single plasmid and up to 3 pol ii drive genes on an additional plasmid this approach improves the probability of a single cell receiving all necessary plasmids during recovery 121 the availability of applicable reverse genetics systems for studying and identifying the structure and function of influenza proteins has revolutionized influenza vaccination strategies  for many years the trivalent vaccine that is currently provided consisted of three separated strains 2 a strains and 1 b strain which were selected based on the who recommendations prior to the next flu season however these vaccines were made using either live-attenuated through cold-adaptation or inactivated virus grown in fertilized chicken eggs next generation vaccination strategies include tetravalent or quadrivalent vaccines which may be grown in animal cell cultures rather than chicken eggs or virus-like particles vlps in cultures of s frugiperda insect sf9 cells 122123124125126127128129 in 2013 the fda approved a seasonal influenza vaccine comprised of purified ha proteins prepared using a baculovirus-expression system 130 these recombinant vaccines were successfully used to vaccinate individuals between 18 and 49 years of age and represents a major step in influenza vaccine design and implementation because this system reduces production time compared to the conventional egg-based approach 131  a major frontier of synthetic biology is the development of new vaccines and therapeutics and the improvement of the implementation and efficacy of those already on the market one major complication to the successful implementation of vaccines currently is the limitations in time between vaccine design and production influenza viruses require seasonal vaccinations and determination of the proper formulations leaves little time for development and implementation new advances in reverse genetics technology are reducing the potential time of recovery and production from months to weeks for instance dormitzer et al have developed an improved platform approach and demonstrated that with current reverse genetics technology it is feasible to generate a recombinant influenza virus from new ha and na sequences within 5 days 132 as new emerging viruses continue to appear and pandemics continue to occur rapid approaches to recover and adapt viruses will be instrumental in the public health response development of common chimeric reverse genetic platforms for rapid cloning and expression of surface antigens from emergent pathogens will help increase the efficacy and timing of delivery during epidemic and pandemic outbreaks one key limitation to the development of effective live-attenuated vaccines is genetic stability rna viruses generally exhibit high mutation rates due to decreased fidelity of the rdrp yet recent studies have shown that codon-usage bias can be used to alter the translation and consequently replication of viruses several groups have shown that substituting non-preferred codons based on host cell codon usage bias a process referred to as codon-deoptimization into the genome of poliovirus resulted in reduction of plaque areas and virus yields 133134 by changing codons rather than amino acids the amount of viral protein may be modulated without impairment in its function more importantly the potential for reversion is greatly limited due to the sheer number of codon changes introduced into the coding sequence this approach represents a promising new avenue to develop attenuated but genetically stable vaccine platforms despite the presence of reverse genetics systems for many human pathogens not all have resulted in successful vaccine platforms advances in biotechnology and key discoveries have led to novel reverse genetic approaches which may be employed in new generation vaccines structural vaccinology or structure-based antigen design has become a common practice for optimizing antigens for display in vaccines 135 as mentioned previously rsv remains a key hurdle to reducing viral childhood morbidity since the discovery and implementation of palivizumab currently the only licensed prophalytic inhibitory measure to rsv infection considerable energy has been devoted to evaluating the antigenic sites of the rsv fusion f protein and optimizing f expression constructs for higher immunogenicity 105 current structural vaccinology efforts to evaluate the pre-fusion and post-fusion antigenic forms of rsv f protein have led to the induction and identification of potent neutralizing antibodies with higher neutralizing potencies than palivizumab 136137 the availability of new structures and sequences has made predictive structural modeling and structure-based antigen design viable options for renewed efforts at design of vaccines for which no current vaccines exist advances in biotechnology have shaped the field of virology as much as any other field of science the capacity to engineer reverse genetics platforms for the study and manipulation of rna virus genomes has revolutionized the field of vaccine design we have described here rna virus reverse genetic systems and past and current efforts to develop vaccines to provide immunity to several human rna virus pathogens the incorporation of new advances in reverse genetics technology adjuvants non-human models of infection and surveillance will continue to drive the development of next generation vaccines to pathogens for which we already have vaccination strategies as well as those that we currently do not ongoing changes in human demographics and accessibility to health care are likely to modify cost-benefit analyses and provoke allocation of new resources for scientific study and development of vaccines despite the ongoing evolution of vaccine design and implementation the hallmarks of an effective viral vaccine will remain the same high efficacy safety and stability  to appear in vaccine sonali kochhar daniel salmon a   the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has led to over 10 million cases covid-19 vaccines development is occurring with unprecedented speed this is partially due to the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi 1 cepi formed in 2017 is a novel partnership between private public philanthropic and civil society organizations it aims to develop vaccines for future epidemics and enable equitable access to vaccines for people during epidemics cepi is mandated to accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccines against previously unknown pathogens with 16 weeks from identification of antigen to vaccine candidate release for clinical trials 1 cepi has announced the initiation of nine covid-19 vaccine programs 2 rapid response platforms for vaccine development supported by cepi are being utilized platform technology use systems with the same basic components as a backbone and insert new protein or genetic sequences to adapt for use against different pathogens 3 the vaccine candidates include a dna vaccine administered with electroporation a molecular-clamp vaccine synthesis of viral surface proteins which attach to host cells during infection and clamps them into shape so that the immune system can recognize them as the correct antigen recombinant protein nanoparticle technology to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike s protein proprietary saponin-based adjuvant a recombinant protein vaccine with the s trimer a replicationdeficient simian adenoviral vaccine chadox1-s a measles-vector vaccine a live-attenuated influenza vaccine and two mrna vaccines a pandemic vaccine adjuvant will be available to enhance development 2 cepi has also launched a call for organisations with large manufacturing capabilities for vaccine candidates to advance an effective vaccine and transfer the vaccine platform to a global network of large-scale manufacturing 2 there are currently 21 covid-19 vaccines candidates in clinical trials including four funded by cepi including the mrna the first to enter clinical trials co-developed with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid usa dna chadox1-s and protein subunit vaccine as shown in table i  4 5 most vaccine candidates are targeting the sars-cov spike s protein 67 displayed on the virus surface which is composed of two subunits 6 7 the s1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain rbd that binds with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 s protein priming occurs through the serine protease tmprss2 to cleave s protein at s1s2 and fusing of the viral and host membranes occurs through the s2 subunit the s protein induces neutralizingantibody and t-cell responses as well as protective immunity during infection with sars-cov 7 the vaccine formulation and delivery are being developed to induce strong neutralizing antibodies predominant cd4  t helper 1 cell th1 immune response and balanced cd4cd8 and polyfunctional t cell responses which have favorable antiviral properties 7 the traditional timeline to develop a vaccine is 15 to 20 years for covid-19 the hope is to have a vaccine available in 12-18 months there are accelerated timelines for vaccine development to achieve who emergency use listing while using regulatory pathways through national regulatory authorities common adverse events that occur shortly after vaccination may be detected in the clinical trials but rare adverse events and those with delayed onset are likely to be detected only once large populations are immunized in addition no dna or rna vaccines have been licensed in humans to date safety surveillance accompanying deployment will be critical historic example of real adverse reactions that are only detected after widespread vaccine use guillain-barr syndrome gbs following the 1976 swine flu vaccine program and enhanced disease post infection after vaccination with the dengue vaccine and coincidental events later found not be caused by the vaccine autism following mmr vaccine and sudden infant death syndrome sids with whole cell pertussis vaccines that undermine the immunization program highlight the critical role for robust safety monitoring adverse events of special interest aesis serious or non-serious are events of significant medical and scientific concern specific to the sponsors program or product these require ongoing monitoring and communication by the investigator to the sponsor and might require further investigation to characterize and understand them and rapid communication by the trial sponsor to regulators they could be related to vaccines in general specific vaccine platforms or the disease aesis reporting and assessment is done with high priority as they could change the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine or require prompt public communication for the covid-19 vaccines the aesis could potentially include vaccine-enhanced disease  vaccination could make subsequent infection with sars-cov-2 more severe 7 enhanced disease with a few deaths was associated with the dengue vaccine and had been reported with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine in young children who received the vaccine and were subsequently infected with natural rsv in 1967 enhanced disease was seen in some preclinical studies with aesi other aesis relevant to covid-19 disease could potentially include respiratory including pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome cardiac including cardiogenic shock cardiomyopathy arrhythmia coronary artery disease myocarditis and pericarditisacute renal and hepatic injury  neurological including encephalopathy encephalitis gbs anosmia and ageusia sepsis and septic shock hypercoagulability rhabdomyolysis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children 9 aesis related to novel adjuvants and vaccine platforms eg cardiac ae including myopericarditis with mva and arthritis with vsv platforms and vaccination eg anaphylaxis thrombocytopenia seizures gbs should also be considered an adverse event following immunization aefi is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine aefis include the background rate of all diseases post-vaccination and may include excess burden of these diseases if the vaccine causes a vaccine adverse reaction safety surveillance must be capable of investigating aefis and aesis as our understanding of the biological mechanisms for adverse reactions has limitations and we must anticipate coincidental events that clinicians the media and the public may attribute to the vaccine safety surveillance must be able to detect and rapidly investigate aesis and aefis to determine if the temporal relationship is causal or coincidental preparations need to be made now in order to ensure that emergency vaccine use in accompanied with robust vaccine safety surveillance and a process for safety assessment which will maintain public confidence in the vaccine the vaccine will likely be used with covid-19 widely circulating thus safety surveillance will need to distinguish between health outcomes caused by the disease versus those caused by the vaccine real or coincidental aesis and aefis have the potential to undermine the vaccine program and exacerbate public fear around the pandemic active and sentinel surveillance systems are necessary to rapidly and rigorously evaluate the safety profile of the vaccines many high-income countries have large healthcare administrative databases to conduct such active surveillance and have vaccine experience however low-and middle-income countries lmic generally lack the capacity to conduct active safety surveillance and do not have large healthcare administrative databases as equitable access to the vaccines for people during epidemics is imperative active safety surveillance in lmic is critical to ensure that safety surveillance is also equitable as was done prior to launch of the 2009-10 h1n1 vaccines active surveillance systems should calculate the incidence of background rates of aesi prior to vaccine roll out 10 establishing these background rates of disease prior to vaccination allows for a stable rate based upon multiple years of data so that the rates of these outcomes after vaccine roll out can be compared cepi is developing a comprehensive list of aesis the incidence of these outcomes will vary tremendously based upon the region underlying population and methods use for case ascertainment which will be highly dependent on the characteristics of the active or sentinel surveillance system surveillance in lmic must be established now in preparation for vaccine roll out so that background rates of aesis can be calculated there are several approaches that can be used to establish active surveillance systems in lmic there is very limited access to large healthcare administrative databases in lmic india it is also essential that countries and regions plan for real and coincidental aesis and aefis with a scientifically rigorous and publicly credible process to separate real adverse reactions from coincidental background rates of disease safety signals require careful evaluation often involving chart review of potential cases which can be both time and labor intensive as recommended by the who global vaccine safety blueprint gvsb 20 countries or regions establish either a national expert committee for aefis or regional advisory committees or equivalent objective panels with spelled out terms of reference 11 public credibility can be optimized by ensuring that these committees are independent of conflicts of interest with the ministries of health industry and the immunization program vaccine safety communication plans with clear national and subnational vaccine safety communication roles and responsibilities should be developed to provide timely evidence-based messaging to describe what is known what is not known and what is being done to fill these gaps the covid-19 pandemic is a global crisis with enormous human and financial costs present efforts aimed at curbing the pandemic through social distancing may be helpful ultimately a vaccine is likely the most important long-term tool however we must invest in active vaccine safety surveillance globally and most particularly in lmic to ensure the potential of a covid-19 vaccine is realized with crisis comes opportunity to expand our global vaccine safety system to meet the needs of covid-19 and other routine and emergency use vaccines the who global vaccine safety blueprint 20 offers the framework to do so and must be fully funded and implemented   measles-derived vaccines to prevent emerging viral diseases phanramphoei frantz n samaporn teeravechyan frdric tangy   emerging viral diseases evds have been making the headlines for the past two decades each subsequent outbreak emphasizes the global lack of preparedness in controlling and minimizing the spread of these diseases to both human and animal populations the burden of evds to public health and the global economy has been massive with direct and indirect costs of zoonotic diseases estimated to exceed us220 billion in the last decade alone 1 2 this rise in evd cases can be traced to a number of causes the growing global population which is expected to reach 97 billion people by 2050 has resulted in expanding urbanization and deforestation exposing populations to reservoirs of new viruses furthermore high-density living conditions are often associated with low quality of life and insufficient health care thus facilitating disease transmission climate change also plays a major role by enabling emergence of infections in new locations with warmer weather increasing the range of arthropod disease vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks globalization and the dramatic growth of international travel also increase the rapidity and scale of emerging disease dissemination of particular concern are the top seven priority pathogens designated by the world health organization who as likely to cause a major outbreak associated with high mortality rates due to the lack of effective medical treatments or countermeasures 3 these pathogens all zoonotic include the crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv ebola and marburg viruses ebov lassa virus lasv middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov nipah virus niv and rift valley fever virus rvfv additionally chikungunya virus chikv and zika virus zikv have been declared health emergencies with epidemic potential by the who 4 despite their low mortality rates as these mosquito-borne arboviruses can rapidly spread through large populations zoonotic viruses can be transmitted directly to humans from their animal reservoirs for example niv can be acquired from bat shedding mers-cov from camels and sars-cov from civets 5 alternately transmission can occur through intermediate hosts such as niv infection of pigs followed by transmission to other pigs or humans 6 and ebov transmission from bats to non-human primates nhps and then to humans 7 larger human outbreaks subsequently occur when individuals come in contact with body fluids urine saliva aerosolized droplets or blood of an infected person air travel and trading ships carrying infected persons animals or vectors can result in intercontinental spread of diseases and pandemics several vaccine platforms have been developed for preventative care of these diseases and preparedness for future outbreaks in this review we will discuss the measles virus mv vector as a promising alternative to conventional vaccine development methods and how its strengths as a vaccination platform for these emerging diseases compare with other approaches this platform is based on a replicating mv vaccine vector with demonstrated proof-of-principle in humans and a preclinical track record of rapid adaptability and effectiveness for a variety of pathogens tackling the unpredictability regarding when and where evds will arise requires strong international disease surveillance networks as well as commitment to the development of preventative measures and post-exposure treatments for this reason in may 2015 the 68th world health assembly welcomed the development of a blueprint for accelerating research and development in epidemics or health emergency situations where there are no or insufficient preventive and curative solutions taking into account other relevant work streams within who 8 the rd blueprint aims to reduce the time between the declaration of an international public health emergency and the availability of effective tests vaccines antivirals and other treatments that can save lives and avert a public health crisis following that initiative the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations httpcepinet was created cepi is an alliance between governments industry academia philanthropy intergovernmental institutions such as the who and civil society that aims to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines to prevent and contain infectious disease epidemics as epidemics disproportionately affect low-income countries cepi will ensure that the vaccines will be affordable and available to populations with the most need there are currently no drugs available to efficiently treat acute virus infection viral inhibitors such as ribavirin and others can reduce and slow down viral replication giving the host immune system a chance to develop and clear the virus however the treatment window for acute viral infections is short and symptoms often only appear late in the course of infection during the viral clearance phase fig 1
 and after the host has become infectious passive immunization can be used in emergency cases in high exposure areas as seen with ebov 9 niv 10 or hendra virus 11 outbreaks but this approach is not practical for general implementation due to high cost and limited efficacy therefore prophylactic vaccination remains the most simple safe and effective way to prevent viral infections and subsequent outbreaks indeed vaccines have been crucial to the control or elimination of many deadly viral diseases and represent the most efficient method to prevent viral infection inactivated killed viruses live attenuated viruses and subunit vaccines comprise the conventional mode of vaccination inactivated-virus vaccines are made of whole virus particles treated with chemicals heat or radiation live attenuated virus vaccines are created by passaging virulent virus strains in animals or cell culture until the virus has adapted to its new host and are no longer pathogenic in target animals or humans usually after 5 to 100 or 200 passages inactivated-virus and subunit vaccines are non-replication competent so while there is no risk of reversion to infectivity they are usually not effective enough to elicit strong host immune responses on their own immunization efficacy requires the use of adjuvants and several boosters which can in turn cause side effects and severe allergic reactions on the other hand live attenuated vaccines elicit long-term protective immune responses because they can replicate inside the host however depending on the number of attenuation mutations and on the viral family there is a risk of reversion where virulence can be regained through reassortment with pathogenic strains as observed with the oral live polio vaccine 12 moreover the conventional attenuation is a lengthy process requiring numerous passages that can take from 6 months to several years of work rendering it impractical as a prompt response to ongoing outbreaks nevertheless given their efficacy simple administration regimens and ease in large-scale manufacture live attenuated vaccines remain attractive choices for vaccine design highly successful examples of live attenuated vaccines include those developed against smallpox yellow fever poliomyelitis and measles with the latter three being successfully implemented in low- and middle-income countries through the expanded program on immunization epi well-tested and effective live attenuated virus vaccines can be modified with modern recombinant dna technology to combine the advantages of replicating viral vectors with the need for rapid methods of developing new vaccines for emerging or re-emerging diseases live replicating vectors such as the mv vector are characterized by induction of long-lived protective immunity after one or two administrations with reverse genetics technology a viral vector vaccine platform can be created to carry antigenic proteins from another circulating virus to yield a vaccine candidate that can be quickly tested in established animal models such a plug-and-play platform has the capacity to provide rapid responses to future emerging viral diseases measles virus mv is a member of the genus morbillivirus in the family of paramyxoviridae it is an enveloped virus with a non-segmented negative-sense single-stranded rna genome of approximately 16 kb in length fig 2
a encoding six structural proteins nucleoprotein n phosphoprotein p matrix m fusion f hemagglutinin h polymerase l and two non-structural proteins v and c the accessory proteins v and c are essential in regulating viral replication and the host innate immune response envelope structure is comprised of h f and m proteins which are responsible for virus attachment membrane fusion and viral entry viral particles are pleomorphic with sizes ranging from 150 to 350 nm due to the flexibility of envelope structure inside the particles the genomic viral rna is tightly wrapped with n p and l to constitute a helicoidal ribonucleoprotein rnp complex which is auto-replicative in the host cytoplasm the rnp serves as the template for viral rna synthesis and with each n molecule associated with 6 nucleotides efficient replication requires that the genome length respects the so-called rule of six which means that the total number of genome nucleotides is dividable by 6 13 since the helicoidal structure is highly flexible like a spring the genome tolerates large insertions as long as the total length complies with the rule of six viral genes are transcribed in succession from the n to l genes as the polymerase stops and restarts at intergenic regions however as efficiency of re-initialization is not 100 mrnas are produced in decreasing amounts from the 5 to 3 end of the genome resulting in the greatest abundance of n and lowest abundance of l protein accumulation of intracellular n protein promotes a shift from transcription to replication during replication l synthesizes a complete copy of the entire genome as a positive-sense antigenome which serves as the template for generation of full-length negative-sense genomes for packaging viral particles are assembled with the n p and l proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm before budding from the plasma membrane together with envelope proteins localized to the surface membrane live attenuated mv vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines available several mv vaccine strains such as the schwarzmoraten edmonston-zagreb and aik-c strains have been developed from the pathogenic wild-type virus by multiple passages in various cellular substrates chicken eggs chicken embryo fibroblasts under different conditions in the past 40 years the mv vaccine has been administered safely to over 2 billion children with no case of reversion reported it induces both humoral and cellular immune responses by efficiently stimulating long-lasting memory b and t-cells and provides life-long immunity it has an efficacy rate of approximately 93 after one administration and 97 after two administrations the virus only replicates in the cytoplasm hence there are no possibility of viral genome integration into the host genome thanks to its non-segmented negative-sense rna genome there is no genomic recombination possible or observed with other viruses furthermore the mv vaccine is currently produced on a large scale in many countries and is globally distributed at low cost through the epi therefore the mv vector platform provides a means of rapidly generating potent vaccine candidates against a broad spectrum of epidemic disease targets and its accessible manufacturing process provides a means to rapidly scale-up vaccines at low cost for stockpiling purposes and as a rapid response vaccine countermeasure to epidemic threats recombinant mv vectors generated from attenuated mv vaccine strains are attractive choices for developing vaccine candidates against other viral infections due to the helicoidal packaging of its genome an mv vector can take up foreign genes up to 6 kb in size and possibly more heterologous proteins can be stably expressed at high levels for more than 12 passages and rescued recombinant viruses retain growth capabilities similar to the original mv strain 14 the mv delivery platform has been developed from its preclinical stages to clinical proof-of-concept for several indications with a preclinical track record of fast and effective adaptability to a variety of pathogens mv vectors are immunogenic in mice and nhps inducing long-term neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity even in the context of preexisting immunity to the vector 15 16 17 18 the initial and pioneer cloning of full-length infectious mv was achieved in 1995 by the group of m billeter in zurich 19 later the schwarz strain of mv was cloned at institut pasteur paris as it is a commercially and who approved mostly attenuated efficient and widely used mv vaccine strain 20 to generate an infectious clone its full-length antigenomic viral cdna fig 2b was cloned into the ptm plasmid under the control of the t7 rna promoter dna sequences containing a ggg motif hammerhead and hepatitis delta viral ribozymes were added to facilitate accurate cleavage of the viral rna and ensure production of full-length viral rna the virus can be produced or rescued by transfection of ptm-mvschw plasmid together with a plasmid expressing the schwarz mv l gene into trans-complemented human cells hek293 cells constitutively expressing t7 rna polymerase mv n and mv p transfected cells are then further co-cultured with any mv permissive cell line such as vero mrc5 or chicken embryonic fibroblasts plaques are picked and seeded for amplification and characterization rescued viruses from the cdna clone possess the same sequence as the parental schwarz strain demonstrating the stability of the negative-sense genome to enable insertion of foreign antigens several additional transcription units atus based on mv cis-acting sequences were introduced into ptm-mvschw at various sites in the genome cloning sites can accommodate inserts of over 6 kb in length in multiples of six base pairs to respect the rule of six that is essential for measles genome replication 13 one common concern regarding the use of mv as a vaccine vector is preexisting immunity due to the broad coverage of mv vaccines in human populations worldwide however it was demonstrated that recombinant mv vaccines induce strong immune responses even in previously immunized animals or humans 15 21 22 although surprising a few mv properties may account for this phenomenon first recombinant mv are replicating therefore although low doses are used the vaccine is amplified in vivo upon cell infection the recombinant mv expresses measles proteins as well as heterologous antigens and mv particles are assembled and released from the cell heterologous antigens are either secreted from the cell or expressed on the cell surface depending on the nature of the antigen and stimulate the immune response second the virus delivers antigens directly to dendritic cells macrophages and b cells the most effective antigen presenting cells and viral particles are transmitted from cell to cell by cell contacts lastly we have recently shown that additional antigens expressed from replicating mv vectors are naturally adjuvanted through defective interfering genomes produced by the recombinant virus contributing to robust induction of interferon and conferring vaccine efficacy 23 this vaccine technology platform has the capacity to address the challenge of rapid vaccine development combining a strong safety and immunogenicity profile demonstrated through multiple applications the ability to target antigens from infectious pathogens in preclinical and clinical settings and a robust antigen-independent scalable manufacturing process several recombinant measles vaccines against a number of viral pathogens have so far been generated and tested in animal models fig 3
 target pathogens include hiv 24 15 25 16 17 26 27 28 west nile virus wnv 29 30 dengue virus denv 31 32 hepatitis b virus hbv 33 human papilloma virus hpv 34 chikv 21 niv 35 respiratory syncytia virus rsv 36 sars-cov 37 mers-cov 18 h5n1 influenza a virus iav unpublished zikv unpublished lasv unpublished and ebov unpublished preclinical immunogenicity and protection from lethal challenges have been shown in mice and nhps for wnv chikv hiv-1 sars-cov h5n1 iav zikv and lasv in the cases of hiv-1 zikv and chikv recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully completed phase i clinical trials in adults with the last progressing to phase ii trials chikungunya virus chikv is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna virus in the family of alphaviridae approximately 30 of infected patients develop debilitating chronic polyarthralgia that can last months or even years initially thought of as an african virus it emerged in 20052006 on la reunion island in the indian ocean infecting a third of the island population before spreading throughout india giving rise to the indian ocean lineage in 2013 it reemerged on the caribbean island of martinique since then chikv has been found in over 60 countries in the americas africa asia and europe with more than 17 million people infected an mv-based chikv vaccine has been developed expressing chikv structural genes c e3 e2 6k e1 cloned from the clinical isolate chikv 0649 ecsa strain 21 expression of chikv structural genes results in formation of virus-like particles during infection in vero cells preclinical studies in cd46ifnar mice showed full protection from lethal chikv challenge after a single immunization even in presence of preexisting immunity to the vector 21 the mv-chikv vaccine candidate was further introduced into clinical trials by themis bioscience httpthemisbiocom immunogenicity was demonstrated in phase i clinical trial with a 90 seroconversion rate after a single injection and 100 seroconversion after boosting 28 days or 3 months apart 22 there were no serious adverse reactions observed even the group receiving a high dose 3  105 tcid50 displayed only mild reactions such as headache flu-like symptoms and mild muscle pain similar to those observed with the control standard mv vaccine 22 most importantly the study demonstrated that the immune response to measles and chikv vlp was not dampened by previous mv immunization since all volunteers were preimmune to measles 22 the phase ii clinical trial is ongoing with 400 volunteers in austria and germany eudract no 2013-001084-23 additionally two independent phase i studies have been initiated in the usa nih and puerto rico dod in june 2017 clinicaltrialsgov nct03028441 nct02861586 the success of mv-chikv thus far reaffirms that the mv vector is an excellent platform for vaccine development dengue virus denv is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna virus in the family flaviviridae that causes a tropical disease endemic in southeast asia and latin america who identified dengue as a neglected disease with potential for emergence in new geographical areas due to climate change 3 the major complication of dengue infection is that four distinct serotypes of the virus circulate after the first denv infection the host acquires life-long immunity to that particular serotype but this does not provide cross-protection against other serotypes rather non-neutralizing antibodies enhance infection of cells carrying the fc receptors used by denv for host cell entry this phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement ade 38 39 due to ade complications the strategy for denv vaccine development is to focus on tetravalent vaccines that simultaneously stimulate immune responses against all four denv serotypes the recently licensed denv vaccine dengvaxia cyd-tdv is a tetravalent yf17d-based recombinant vaccine that has completed phase 3 clinical trials and is now distributed in southeast asia and south america 40 however the vaccine poses a safety concern associated with increased risk of disease exacerbation in recipients who have not been previously exposed to denv sanofi has pulled the vaccine from the philippines after recent concerns and vaccine use is recommended only for individuals with prior exposure to denv given the limitations of the current vaccine other options are still being explored an mv-based tetravalent vaccine candidate is in development as well the denv antigen used consists of domain iii of the e glycoprotein ediii from each of the four serotypes as it contains serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes fused to the ectodomain of the membrane protein m 32 this m ectodomain is essential for immunogenicity of the inserted tetravalent ediii due to its adjuvant properties through induction of pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines and chemokines 31 preclinical trials revealed that immunized mice and macaques developed neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes unpublished data zika virus zikv is a flavivirus closely related to denv with approximately 40 amino acid difference compared to the 3035 difference between the four denv serotypes 41 42 zikv was first identified among humans primates and mosquitoes in the zika forest of uganda in 1947 43 in 1969 it emerged in southeast asia and became largely endemic in tropical regions the first massive outbreak was seen on yap island in 2007 where more than 70 of the population became infected in 2017 the disease reached latin america with a major outbreak in brazil zikv infection shares some common symptoms with other arbovirus infections such as fever flu-like symptoms and rashes in the brazilian outbreak around half of the cases exhibited no symptoms but the virus could be detected in the saliva of infected individuals 44 zikv was declared an emergency public health concern by the who in 2016 due to neurological complications associated with guillain barr syndrome as reported in french polynesia and microcephaly in newborns as reported in brazil 45 congenital zikv syndromes suggested human-to-human transmission through sexual intercourse breast milk or placental transfer 46 47 with its close evolutionary relationship to denv ade between both viruses has been reported in vitro sera of denv-infected individuals facilitate zikv infection in usually non-permissive cells 48 although not confirmed in humans this phenomenon could complicate vaccine development against zikv and denv vaccines currently in preclinical trials include an mv-based vaccine which was developed by cloning the full-length prm and e genes prm-e of zikv into the ptm-mvschw vector this vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic and conferred full protection to both mice and monkeys a phase i clinical trial was initiated in 2017 themis bioscience httpthemisbiocom severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses possessing genomes approximately 279 and 301 kb in size respectively while both viruses are thought to originate from bats the first known case of sars occurred through transmission from a palm civet 49 in foshan china in november 2002 before spreading throughout china and to other countries who tallied 8096 reported cases in 27 countries in 2003 due to a global effort in disease management the outbreak was declared to be over by july of that year ten years after the first sars incidence mers-cov emerged in saudi arabia in 2012 with cases arising from transmission from dromedary camels to humans as mers-cov has not been observed to spread from person to person like sars-cov a localized outbreak arising from an imported case was observed only in south korea as a result of nosocomial transmission from a single infected traveler 50 the structural spike s proteins of covs have been identified as targets for neutralizing antibodies and are considered potential targets for subunit and viral vector vaccine development at institut pasteur an mv-based vaccine against sars-cov has been developed where a human codon-optimized gene encoding the native sars-cov s or its soluble form was inserted into the atu between the p and m sequences of ptm-mvschw 37 these gene insertions did not interfere with recombinant mv growth and titer the vaccine was tested in mice and found to induce neutralizing antibodies all immunized animals were protected from a lethal dose of sars-cov challenge delivered intranasally native s was observed to be more potent in eliciting antibodies than its soluble counterpart and these antibodies were found to possess high neutralizing activity against both sars-cov and mv 51 higher igg2a than igg1 levels were observed suggesting a th1-biased response for mers-cov an mv-based vaccine has been generated using a modified edmonston strain backbone carrying either the full-length or soluble mers-cov s between the p and m genes 18 like the sars-cov version this vaccine also induced neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific cytotoxic t-cells both elispot assays and intracellular cytokine staining by flow cytometry showed strong increase in specific cd3 cd8 t cells from vaccinated mice after ex vivo restimulation with the s antigen as well as a positive killing assay 18 the promising results thus far demonstrate that the mv vector has great potential for further sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine development ebola and marburg viruses ebov and marv are enveloped negative-sense single-stranded rna viruses in the filoviridae family responsible for hemorrhagic fevers associated with high fatality rates of up to 50 ebov was first discovered in 1976 in congo and sudan its circulation has generally been restricted to central african countries where several ebov strains and marv cause frequent outbreaks they continue to cause sporadic outbreaks re-emerging regularly in eastern and central africa in december 2013 however an unprecedented outbreak emerged in the western african country of guinea causing a major crisis with its rapid spread within the country as well as to the neighboring sierra leone and liberia air travel led to imported cases in many countries us spain mali and uk turning the ebov epidemic into a global public health emergency from 2013 to 2016 who documents indicate a total of 28464 reported cases of ebov infection with 11323 reported deaths while a concerted international effort managed to stem the outbreak ebov outbreaks are predicted to persist into the next decade 52 this recent outbreak re-energized ebov vaccine development with a massive influx of funding and several vaccine candidates were placed in accelerated development among them were two viral-vector vaccines targeting the envelope glycoprotein gp of ebov which are currently in phase iiiii clinical trials the first vaccine is based on the vesicular stomatitis virus vsv vector expressing the ebov zaire strain gp rvsv-zebov 53 54 this vector is based on a cattle virus not frequently associated with human infection nhp experiments demonstrated that this vaccine protects against ebov challenge and is also effective as post-infection treatment within a few days of infection drawbacks of the rvsv-zebov vaccine include unknown duration of protection and possible adverse effects depending on the dose used a phase i clinical trial was abruptly stopped due to serious joint pain and dermatitis 55 for now however the vaccine has proven effective in limiting disease spread when implemented in a ring vaccination scheme in guinea 56 57 55 the second vaccine candidate against ebov is an adenovirus vector ad expressing ebov-gp this vaccine vector provides the benefit of being non-pathogenic to humans and is naturally controlled by the immune system however the first generation of ad-based vaccines had reduced effectiveness due to pre-existing immunity which was later overcome by the use of a chimpanzee adenovirus strain chad 58 regardless of preexisting immunity to confer a long-lasting immunity huad and chad platforms require a booster delivered by a heterologous modified vaccinia virus ankara mva vector prime-boost protocols are difficult to set up in ebov-emerging countries where healthcare systems are weak and unavailable in some areas moreover the dose required for efficient protection is 1011 tcid50 a highly challenging task for manufacturing a vaccine for millions of individuals the mv vector provides an attractive alternative for vaccine development that can circumvent possible safety issues associated with the rvsv vector and the manufacturing hurdles and complex regimen of the adv vector approach in particular mv ability to elicit both humoral and cellular responses will be advantageous for efficient protection as t-cell responses have been shown to play some role in controlling ebov infection 59 and will probably be instrumental for maintaining long-term memory furthermore the large insertion capacity of the mv vector enables development of a combined vaccine against both ebov and marv mv expressing different forms of gp of ebov zaire strain are currently being tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in the nhp model at institut pasteur lassa virus lasv is a bi-segmented negative-sense single-stranded rna virus in the family arenaviridae that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans the natal multimammate rat is its natural reservoir with most infections occurring by rodent-to-human transmission human-to-human spread can occur through direct contact of infected body fluids and in nosocomial settings lassa fever causes non-specific symptoms but in severe cases vascular leakage and multi-organ failure have been reported the disease was first identified in nigeria in 1969 and was detected throughout western and central africa within a decade unlike ebov infection lassa fever occurs annually posing a major threat to local populations travelers and healthcare workers the us cdc estimates that lasv causes 100000300000 cases and 5000 deaths yearly among hemorrhagic fever viruses lasv causes the highest global burden due to its stability and aerosol transmission which also render it a potential bioterrorism threat several virus-based vectors including vsv 60 vaccinia virus 61 and yellow fever virus yf17d 62 carrying the surface glycoprotein complex gpc of lasv showed promising immunological results in guinea pig and nhp models ninety percent of nhp survived lethal lasv challenge after vaccination with vaccinia-lasv-gp 61 this study also confirmed that cell-mediated immune responses are key to lasv protection however use of the vaccinia-based vaccine is not desirable for the high hiv prevalence regions of africa as it is still unclear whether immunosuppressed individuals face risks of increased vaccinia replication and generalized infection on the other hand the yf17d vector expressing lasv-gpc was observed to exhibit genetic instability of the antigen due to the vectors small insertion capacity 62 various versions of the gp1 and gp2 glycoproteins were tested in yf17d to resolve this issue but loss of antigen expression was still observed after five passages of the recombinant virus an mv-based vaccine mv-lasv-npgpc is currently being developed at institut pasteur with no problem of antigen instability due to the high insertion capacity of this vector experiments in macaques have shown the great efficacy of this vaccine candidate to protect the animals after a single immunization from lethal lasv challenge unpublished data nipah virus niv is a henipavirus in the paramyxoviridae family it is an enveloped negative-sense single-stranded rna virus that causes disease in both humans and animals its reservoir is the fruit bat and transmission occurs through contact with bat saliva or urine often through consumption of contaminated fruits or date palm sap the disease first emerged with a fatal case of acute encephalitis in the town of nipah in malaysia in 1998 and was followed by a few hundred cases of disease with over 30 mortality the virus re-emerged in india and bangladesh in 20012008 with a higher fatality rate of 70100 pigs act as amplifying hosts where infection causes mostly respiratory symptoms and is known as the barking pig disease direct transmission from infected pigs to humans has been reported 6 in addition the fact that a number of infected patients never came into contact with either bats or pigs indicates occurrence of human-to-human transmission of niv 63 64 vaccine target antigens for niv are its fusion protein f and glycoprotein g which are the surface proteins important for host cell attachment and viral entry the various immunization strategies have been summarized in a previous review 11 canarypox virus carrying f and g was developed for use in animals and showed protection against intranasal challenge in piglets 65 for human vaccination vaccinia virus adenovirus mv and vsv 10 35 66 67 have all been used as viral vectors these vaccine candidates all elicited specific neutralizing antibodies and protected against challenge in hamster and ferret models with vsv-niv-g demonstrating partial protection against lethal challenge in nhps as well although some lesions were observed in brain cells suggesting viral replication in the central nervous system 68 the mv-based vaccine involved insertion of the niv g gene into the edmonston strain-based vector initial immunogenicity testing was performed in hamsters and showed full protection from lethal challenge after the second immunization in nhp model monkeys were vaccinated with 1  105 tcid50 of rmv-niv-g with one booster and showed no clinical signs after challenge with niv demonstrating full protection in vaccinated monkeys 35 rift valley fever virus rvfv is a phlebovirus with a tri-segmented negative-sense single-stranded rna genome it is transmitted by several aedes spp and culex spp mosquitoes to livestock and humans infection causes acute severe disease in ruminants with fever loss of appetite aborted fetuses and a high mortality rate in newborn animals humans are dead-end hosts and infection results in a febrile illness with approximately 1 of those infected presenting with more severe symptoms such as encephalitis or hemorrhagic syndromes it first appeared in the rift valley region of kenya and the virus itself was isolated in 1930 several major outbreaks were reported throughout africa before first appearing outside the region in 2000 with a large outbreak in the arabian peninsula the three segments of the rvfv genome have been named the small s medium m and large l genes the two envelope glycoproteins gn or gc serve as receptor-binding proteins to facilitate virus attachment and infection rendering them targets for vaccine development subunit vaccines targeting gn or gc have been shown to elicit specific rvfv neutralizing antibodies 69 many vaccine platforms have been used to develop vaccine candidates for rvfv while there are no licensed vaccines for humans available yet animal vaccines include the live attenuated smithburn and inactivated rvfv in africa 70 unfortunately these are not diva differentiating infected from vaccinated animals vaccines which can present a problem for the export of livestock and its products among the vaccines in the pipeline clinical trials have been conducted for formalin-inactivated and attenuated vaccines and these have demonstrated seroconversion and long-term protection against rvfv in both animals and humans 71 72 nevertheless the attenuated vaccine retains the risk of reversion through reassortment with field strains while an mv vector has not yet been used in the development of an rvfv vaccine considering the drawbacks of the current vaccine options and candidates its advantages provide a strong argument to pursue this approach furthermore mv has been shown to infect animals through the nectin4 receptor without requiring cd46 unpublished making this platform viable for animal vaccines as well the mv platform is highly flexible enabling easy modification to create a replicating delivery vector for various protective antigens this platform benefits of the advantages of live attenuated vaccines without the risks and drawbacks this plug-and-play property will help ensure the timely availability of preventive vaccines whenever a new epidemic occurs the platform has a track record in safety and immunogenicity for other relevant antigens and pathogens and a well-established production process that allows substantial acceleration in development timelines the various mv-vectored vaccines that have demonstrated solid performance in early phase clinical trials provide proof-of-concept that the mv platform is a powerful tool in the fight against current and emerging viral pathogens the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article  superior immune responses induced by intranasal immunization with recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine expressing full-length spike protein of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus myung kim hee hyun kim jik jun chang paulo ho lee   middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has emerged as a novel lethal human pathogen which causes severe acute respiratory infection since its identification in saudi arabia in 2012 1 the virus causes respiratory diseases such as fever cough and shortness of breath which may lead to pneumonia and acute renal failure in immunocompromised patients and the elderly 17 to date 2266 laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection cases including 804 related deaths from 27 countries have been reported to world health organization httpwwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven currently such cases are increasingly being reported mers-cov also has the potential for a widespread outbreak as observed in 2015 in south korea 8 currently the lack of prophylactic or therapeutic measures has created an urgent need for effective vaccine the development against mers-cov infections 910 mers-cov is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna virus that belongs to lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus -cov in the family coronaviridae 1113 the mers-cov genome encodes four structural proteins spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n 1415 the s protein a type i transmembrane glycoprotein on the virus surface contains two functional subunits and mediates viral infection the s1 subunit comprises n-terminal domain ntd and receptor-binding domain rbd that recognizes and binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 receptor on the host cell surface to initiate infection 1618 the s2 subunit with two heptad repeats hr hr1 and hr2 facilitates fusion between the virus and host cell membrane 1920 the s glycoprotein is considered as a suitable vaccine candidate for eliciting neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry or neutralize viral infection 2123 the spike protein-based vaccine candidates have been developed and investigated such as whole-inactivated virus 24 subunit vaccines 222529 dna-based vaccines 273031 and viral vector-based vaccines 3236 using both the spike protein as a whole and spike protein fragments these vaccine candidates induced humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses however a vaccination strategy focused on rbd alone has several issues that may not be optimal for generating neutralizing antibody responses 27 and can only induce partial protection against the mers-cov infection 2937 detailed structural analysis revealed that rbd-specific antibodies stimulate the emergence of viral escape mutation in this region therefore the generation of more diverse antibodies directed toward both rbd and outside the domain may be a better strategy for developing effective vaccines 2738 here we designed and constructed recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine candidates encoding ntd rbd and full-length spike protein we assessed their immunogenicity and compared immune responses generated from vaccination via different routes and found that radspike could induce the strongest humoral and cellular immune responses additionally immunization with radspike conferred long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses suggesting that radspike is the best candidate for an effective mers-cov vaccine

appropriate statistical significance was considered when p values were 005 we designed and generated three recombinant adenoviruses as vaccine candidates containing codon-optimized full-length spike rbd or ntd region of the spike the coding sequences of full-length spike 11353 rbd 367606 and ntd 18353 were cloned into the shuttle vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus cmv promoter and subsequently inserted into the adenovirus genome via homologous recombination the construction schemes of the recombinant replication-defective adenoviruses designated radspike radrbd and radntd were shown in fig 1a to confirm transgene expression hek293 cells were infected with radspike radrbd or radntd and western blotting was performed western blot performed using mers-cov s1-specific antibody revealed two prominent bands at 200 kda and 120 kda for the culture supernatant and lysate of radspike-infected cells fig 1b we considered the protein species with a higher molecular weight of 200 kda to be the glycosylated s1s2 spike protein and the species with a lower molecular weight of 120 kda to be the s1 subunit of the spike protein cleaved by host cell protease 1933364243 the rbd domain was detected as a single band with a molecular weight of 3540 kda in the lysate and culture supernatant of radrbd-infected cells fig 1c the molecular weight of rbd increased slightly in the culture supernatant which might be due to the different patterns of glycosylation between the culture supernatant and the lysate 44 the single band of 50 kda was observed only in the culture supernatant of radntd-infected hek293 cells by in-house radspike-immunized mouse serum fig 1d to compare the immunogenicity of our recombinant adenoviral vaccine candidates balbc mice were immunized twice on day 0 and day 14 with radntd radrbd radspike or control adenovirus radmock via in route mice were sacrificed at 7 days after boost immunization to analyze both humoral and cellular immune responses all candidate vaccines induced significant s1-specific systemic igg responses in sera as opposed to the negative control radmock vaccine fig 2a notably the radspike-immunized group induced the highest s1-specific serum igg responses among the three groups mucosal iga in the respiratory tract plays critical roles in host defense against respiratory virus infections 45 thus we measured the spike-specific mucosal iga antibody responses in balfs s1-specific iga was detected in all vaccination groups but not in the control group fig 2b among the three vaccination groups the radspike group elicited the highest levels of s1-specific iga response and the radntd group showed a higher titer than that shown by the radrbd group next to examine the ability of our candidate vaccines to induce cellular immune responses mice were sacrificed at 7 days after boost injection which is the peak of cd8 t-cell responsesand their lung cells were harvested lung lymphocytes were stained with kds291 tetramer to quantify spike-specific cd8 t cells previous studies have reported that cd8 t-cell responses to the mers-cov spike protein were dominantly directed toward s291 kyysiiphsi epitope 46 other studies also screened epitopes in the rbd region to measure antigen-specific cd8 t-cell responses but the frequency of ifn--producing cd8 t cells responding to other peptides seems to be either undetectable or very low 4647 therefore we employed the s291 immunodominant epitope to evaluate the spike-specific cd8 t-cell responses significant percentages of kds291 tetramer-positive cd8 t cells were detected in the lungs of radntd- or radspike-immune mice but not in the lungs of the mice in the radmock or radrbd group fig 2c and 2d s291-specific cd8 t cells were not observed in radrbd-immunized mice because rbd aa residues from 367 to 606 does not contain the s291 epitope to assess the levels of effector cd8 and cd4 t cells secreting ifn- lung lymphocytes were stimulated with s291 peptide or mers s1 protein respectively ifn--producing cd8 t cells were also increased significantly in the radspike and radntd groups and ifn--producing cd4 t cells were increased significantly in the radspike group s1 fig subsequently neutralizing activities of the immune sera and balfs were evaluated using mers-cov spike pseudotyped particles among the candidate vaccine groups the radspike-immune mice exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibody in both sera and balfs followed by mice in the radntd group fig 3a3c however radrbd group exhibited no significant difference in neutralizing activity compared with the radmock control group to further confirm the neutralizing activity of the radspike-induced antibody in an authentic mers-cov infection of human primary respiratory cells mers-cov were preincubated with the immune sera from radspike and radmock group before infection of nhne cells subsequently the viral replication levels were measured by quantitative rt-pcr as shown in fig 3d pre-treatment of radspike-immune sera significantly inhibited mers-cov replication while radmock sera did not taken together these results demonstrate that immunization with radspike is the most efficient for eliciting both neutralizing antibody responses in serum and balf and t-cell responses recent studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies could also be directed against non-rbds such as ntd besides rbd 2648 our results also indicate that ntd can elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization therefore we further investigated the regional specificity of neutralizing activities induced by immunization with rad vaccines first serum igg responses were analyzed by elisa using ntd rbd or s2 protein as coating antigens the rntd protein was prepared and purified using a baculovirus expression system s2 fig both radntd and radspike groups exhibited significantly higher levels of ntd-specific serum igg than the control group and there was no significant difference in ntd-specific serum igg levels between the radntd and radspike groups fig 4a both the radrbd and radspike groups exhibited significantly higher levels of rbd-specific serum igg than the negative control group fig 4b as expected only radspike group showed significantly higher s2-specific serum igg responses than the control group fig 4c to investigate the target domains mainly involved in neutralization we compared changes in the neutralizing activity of sera collected from radspike group using protein competitors sera diluted at 1640 were pre-incubated with 10 g of ntd rbd s1 or s2 protein at 37c for 1 h neutralization assay was subsequently performed as shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 4d neutralization activity of immune sera was significantly reduced by pre-incubation with ntd rbd and s1 protein competitors especially competition with the s1 protein inhibited neutralizing activity by 60 while ntd and rbd competitors inhibited neutralization activity by 8 and 6 respectively in contrast soluble s2 protein competitor did not have any effect on neutralization activity these results demonstrate that radspike can induce neutralizing antibody responses targeting various regions of s1 including ntd and rbd this also suggests that employing radspike might be better vaccination strategy in eliciting broader spectrum of neutralizing antibody responses previously we showed that among all vaccine candidates radspike possesses the strongest immunogenicity for inducing humoral and cellular immune responses then we investigated the best route for immunization by injecting mice with radspike via in im or sl route sera were collected 2 weeks after each immunization and measured for specific igg by elisa significant spike-specific igg levels were detected regardless of the immunization route fig 5a notably in immunization induced the highest igg antibody responses among the groups after the boost immunization significant spike-specific iga levels were detected in balfs of mice from in and sl groups but not in those from the im group fig 5b and the response was also highest in the in group to investigate whether the immunization route affects neutralizing antibody responses the neutralizing activity of sera and balfs collected from each group was analyzed using the pseudotyped virus all immunization routes generated significant serum-neutralizing antibody levels as opposed to the radmock control group fig 6a and 6b however no neutralization activity was observed in balf of mice immunized via im route this finding was consistent with mucosal iga response shown in fig 6 ic50 neutralization titer did not show statistically significant differences between in and sl immunization taken together these results indicate that mucosal immunization of radspike vaccine can induce both systemic and mucosal neutralizing antibodies while im immunization could only elicit systemic responses lung-resident memory t trm cells reportedly mediate protection against respiratory virus infections and mucosal immunization is thought to generate trm cells in the lung 4951 to investigate the influence of immunization route in the establishment of lung trm cells balbc mice were administered in or im vaccine containing radspike at a concentration of 1108 pfus at a memory time point day 30 mice were intravenously injected with anti-cd45-apc antibody and sacrificed after 5 min to discriminate circulating cells from lung-localized cells 52 as shown in s3 fig cells stained with anti-cd45 ab were identified as circulating t cells in blood and cells protected from in vivo labeling were confined to the lung parenchyma at this time point mice immunized via in route had significantly higher frequencies and numbers of kds291 tetramer-positive cd8 t cells in the airway and lung parenchyma compared with im-immunized mice fig 7a and 7b in contrast there were no significant differences in the numbers of kds291 tetramer-positive cd8 t cells in the lung vasculature and spleen between in and im immunization groups we subsequently assessed the co-expression of cd103 and cd69 as the canonical makers of lung trm 53 a majority of kds291 tetramer-positive cd8 t cells in the airway and lung parenchyma in in-immunized mice were cd69 or cd69cd103 and their frequencies were significantly higher than im-immunized mice fig 7c and 7d taken together these results show that in immunization is more efficient in establishing antigen-specific cd8 trm cells in the airway and lung parenchyma than im immunization the persistence and maintenance of immune responses following vaccination is important for vaccine efficacy 54 thus we assessed whether radspike immunization could induce long-term antibody responses balbc mice were inoculated three times weeks 0 3 and 11 with 1107 pfus of radspike via in route and sera were collected at 2 6 15 and 30 weeks the specific antibody responses were subsequently measured by elisa fig 8a spike-specific serum igg and mucosal iga titers gradually increased with each immunization and maintained until 30 weeks with no obvious decline fig 8b and 8c to evaluate neutralizing activities the assay was performed using sera collected at 15 and 30 weeks as well as balfs obtained at 30 weeks in agreement with igg responses serum neutralizing activities at 30 weeks were similar to those at 15 weeks fig 8d the absolute titer of neutralization in balf at 30 weeks was lower than that at an earlier time point shown in fig 3 but remained at a significant level in comparison with the control fig 8e overall the results demonstrate that in immunization with radspike could induce long-lasting neutralizing antibodies which might be beneficial for protection against mers-cov infection since the emergence and spread of mers the development of safe and effective vaccines against mers-cov is urgently required 755 mers-cov spike protein is the main mediator of virus entry into the target cells 1723 therefore spike protein is one of key targets for the development of vaccines and therapeutics 23 several vaccine candidates targeting rbd of the spike protein have been investigated 222528293256 however it seems that the efficacy of the rbd-based vaccine candidates are limited by the confined breadth of antibody responses and subsequent emergence of escape mutants 273857 indeed it has been shown that several mutations in the rbd region can result in the generation of neutralization escape variants 385860 several studies have reported that other regions of spike protein rather than rbd can also be targets of neutralizing antibodies 26274861 in this study we constructed adenovirus-based vaccine candidates that express ntd rbd and full-length spike and compared immunogenicity and neutralizing activity induced by these candidates our results clearly showed that the radspike vaccine expressing full-length spike protein is the best candidate in terms of immunogenicity and neutralizing efficacy it is likely that neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were located on non-rbd of the s1 subunit as well as rbd based on the results of protein competitor experiments fig 4 the use of full-length spike as an immunogen in radspike vaccine might increase the breadth of the antibody responses which will help to reduce the risk of escape mutations 275762 however it is not yet clear whether s2 region also contributes for inducing neutralizing antibodies by radspike vaccination s2 subunit protein as a competitor did not reduce the neutralizing activities of the immune sera in the protein competitor experiments fig 4 and this might be due to the inappropriate conformation of s2 subunit 2763 further studies are needed to determine whether the s2 subunit also contributes for eliciting neutralizing antibodies it is noteworthy that the radspike vaccine induced systemic igg mucosal iga and t-cell responses together upon in immunization in addition to neutralizing antibodies virus-specific cd8 t cells also play an important role in mers-cov clearance 46 indeed several studies suggest that both virus-neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic cd8 t cell responses are necessary for complete protection against mers-cov infection 293335 therefore the radspike vaccine expressing the full-length spike protein rather than the rbd or ntd alone might be most potent one among our vaccine candidates our results also demonstrate that in immunization induces superior responses compared to im and sl immunization in terms of neutralizing efficacy mers-cov infection occurs through respiratory tracts in humans 364 accordingly vaccination routes capable of inducing local mucosal immunity such as secretory iga would be more potent in preventing mers-cov infection in addition in immunization with radspike vaccine induced significantly higher numbers of specific trm cells in the airway and lung parenchyma compared with im-immunized mice fig 6 it is likely that lung-resident trm cells mediate effective protective immunity against respiratory infections 5365 thus in immunization of radspike eliciting systemic igg secretory iga and trm responses together might be the most promising regimen compared to other immunization routes and provide superior protection in summary we generated several recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine candidates against mers-cov and compared systemic and local humoral responses and cellular responses via different immunization routes we found that single in immunization of radspike successfully induces systemic igg secretory iga and lung trm responses and provides long-lasting neutralizing immunity therefore our recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine could be further developed as a safe and efficacious vaccine for preventing mers-cov infection and spreading  development of a covid-19 vaccine based on the receptor binding domain displayed on virus-like particles lisha zha hongxin zhao mona mohsen o hong liang yuhang zhou zehua li chuankai yao lijie guo hongquan chen xuelan liu xinyue chang jie zhang dong li ke wu monique vogel martin bachmann f junfeng wang martin bachmann  the recently ermerging disease covid-19 is caused by the new sars-cov-2 virus first detected in the city of wuhan china from there it has been rapidly spreading inside and outside china with initial death rates around 4 covid-19 patients at longer distances from wuhan showed reduced mortality as was previously observed for the sars coronavirus however the new coronavirus spreads more strongly as it sheds long before  onset of symptoms or may be transmitted by people without symptoms rapid development of a protective vaccine against covid-19 is therefore of paramount importance here we demonstrate that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein homologous to sars binds to ace2 the viral receptor higly repetitive display of rbd on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus resulted in a vaccine candidate rbd-cumvtt that induced high levels of specific antibodies in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ace2 and potently neutralized the sars-cov-2 virus in vitro covid-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus closely related to viruses causing sars and mers as the disease caused by the other two viruses covid-19 mainly manifests symptoms in the lung and causes cough and fever 1  the disease covid-19 is less severe than sars and mers which is beneficial per se but leads to easier and wider spread of the virus in particular due to infected individuals with very little symptoms spreaders and a long incubation time up to 3 weeks combined with viral shedding long before disease onset 2  a vaccine with rapid onset of protection is therefore in high demand for the control of the pandemic that is currently taking its course the spike protein of covid-19 is highly homologous to the spike protein of sars and both viruses share the same receptor which is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 3 4  the receptor binding domain rbd of the sars spike protein binds to ace2 and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies 5 6 7  by analogy the rbd of covid-19 spike protein may be expected to similarly be the target of neutralizing antibodies blocking the interaction of the virus with its receptor we have previously shown that antigens displayed on virus-like particles vlp induce high levels of antibodies in all species tested including humans 8  more recently we have developed an immunologically optimized vlp platform based on cucumber mosaic virus these cumvtt vlps hereafter cumvtt incorporate a universal t cell epitope derived from tetanus toxin providing pre-existing t cell help in addition during the production process these vlps package bacterial rna which is a ligand for toll-like receptor 78 and serves as potent adjuvants 9  using antigens displayed on these vlps it 4 was possible to induce high levels of specific antibodies in mice rats cats dogs and horses and treat diseases such as atopic dermatitis in dogs or insect bite hypersensitivity in horses 9 10 11  to generate a covid-19 vaccine candidate we therefore attempted to display the rbd domain on cumvtt fig 1a  to this end we gene-synthesized the covid-19 rbd domain and fused it to an fc molecule for better expression as expected the protein bound efficiently to the viral receptor ace2 as determined by sandwich elisa fig 1b  in a next step the protein was chemically coupled to the surface of cumvtt using the well established chemical cross-linkers sata and smph ref 9 sds-page and western blotting confirmed efficient coupling of the rbd-fusion molecule to cumvtt resulting in the vaccine candidate rbd-cumvtt fig 1cd  to test immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate mice were immunized three times weekly schedule with the rbd-fusion molecule alone or conjugated to the surface of cumvtt formulated in montanide adjuvants as shown in fig 2a -c coupling to vlps dramatically increased the immunogenicity of the rbd as shown by elisa on recombinant rbd rbd-cumvtt showed strongly increased immunogenicity at all time-points tested one week after the vaccine injection time-points to assess the potential for anti-viral activity we assessed whether the induced antibodies were able to block binding of the rbd protein to the viral receptor ace2 as shown in fig 3  immune sera obtained after two boosts day 21 were able to strongly inhibit rbd binding to ace2 the best correlate of protection is viral neutralization to this end we generated pseudotyped retroviruses 12 expressing the sars-cov-2 spike protein and luciferase for quantification of infection fig 4a  using these viruses the neutralizing capacity of the sera from immunized mice was assessed on ace2-transfected cells fig 4b  directly demonstrating high anti-viral neutralizing activity of the induced antibodies hence the rbd-cumvtt vaccine candidate is able to induce high levels of sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies furthermore the cumvtt based vaccine is based on highly efficient expression systems and chemical conjugation technologies rendering it an attractive candidate for large scale production under cgmp previous studies with a similar vlp-based conjugate vaccine has demonstrated that high levels of specific antibodies can be mounted within a week 13 14 see also fig 2a  offering the additional possibilities to rapidly immunize individuals that have been exposed to infected humans or those that are kept in quarantine thus vaccines based on the sars-cov-2 rbd domain displayed on vlps may have the potential to critically interfere with global spread of the virus 5  the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain rbd and the n-terminal peptidase domain of human ace2 were expressed using 293f cells

potential treatments kam hon lun karen leung ka alexander leung kc su qian yun vivian chan py patrick ip ian wong ck   viral respiratory infections such as influenza and measles which can cause severe acute respiratory symptoms have been responsible for many epidemics in the spring of 2003 an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infection sari spread globally123 the world health organization who coined the acronym sars severe acute respiratory syndrome for this sari and subsequently named the causative coronavirus sars-cov in the summer of 2012 another sari broke out in saudi arabia which was found to be caused by a new coronavirus the who named this respiratory disease middle east respiratory syndrome also known by the acronym mers and called the causative coronavirus mers-cov in the winter of 2019 another sari outbreak occurred in wuhan china which very quickly spread around the world the culprit was identified as another novel coronavirus which the who named as sars-cov-2 due to similarities to sars-cov and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 sars-cov-2 is a newly emergent coronavirus closely related to sars and mers4 covid-19 is a respiratory tract infection that causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases but can also lead to mortality and morbidity current reports suggest that covid-19 causes milder symptoms in children including fever and cough but co-infection has also been observed45 however covid-19 is associated with severe outcomes in the older population immunocompromised patients and those with chronic cardiovascular or respiratory conditions4 at present no pharmaceutical products have been shown to be reliable safe and effective for treating covid-196 in the midst of the current global pandemic many research groups around the world are actively developing treatments against this disease to reduce morbidities and mortalities in the long term the goal is to develop a vaccine to prevent further infections and future outbreaks however an effective vaccine may take years to develop and to manufacture on a global scale furthermore it is unknown if newborns and patients already recovered from covid-19 will need to be vaccinated it is also uncertain if such a vaccine can protect individuals from this novel coronavirus in the future in this narrative review we summarise the latest body of evidence and ongoing research on the development of pharmacological therapies for covid-19 the aim is also to review the suggested pathophysiology prophylactic treatments and therapeutic modalities for covid-19 articles were retrieved using pubmed clinical queries with the search term coronavirus covid-19 regardless of the date of publication there were 88 articles under clinical study categories category therapy scope broad and 11 systematic reviews the discussion is based on but not limited to these search results severe acute respiratory syndrome is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by sars-cov the sars outbreak between november 2002 and july 2003 resulted in 8098 cases and 774 deaths in 29 countries around the world giving a case-fatality rate of 9678 treatments for sars during the outbreak were mainly supportive as there were no known effective antiviral agents the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections was the main treatment regimen9 ribavirin a broad-spectrum purine nucleoside analogue was empirically used as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent10 human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitor lopinavirritonavir were also used as it was found to have weak in vitro antiviral activity on the prototype sars-cov1011 other therapies included immunomodulators eg corticosteroid convalescent plasma and pentaglobulin interferons and traditional chinese medicine tcm912 the development of vaccines was underway by the end of the epidemic but no effective vaccine has since emerged middle east respiratory syndrome caused by mers-cov may have been transmitted to humans through infected camels the mers outbreak between september 2012 and january 2020 was reported to have caused 2519 laboratory-confirmed cases and 858 associated deaths globally giving a case-fatality rate of 34413 as of 2019 there is still no effective vaccine or treatment for this disease although a number of antiviral medications have been investigated14 a 2019 systematic review of therapeutic agents against mers-cov showed that there is still no general consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for mers-cov infection15 the miracle trial mers-cov infection treated with a combination of lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1b was the first randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility efficacy and safety of a combination of lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1b in hospitalised patients with mers1617 the trial was started in july 2016 and enrolled 194 participants although results have yet to be published1617 at present only three potential mers-cov vaccine candidates have progressed to phase i clinical trials it is very likely that no mers vaccine will be available in the near future18 the recent covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-219 is suggested to have originated in bats and transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediate host possibly pangolins2021 sars-cov-2 first emerged in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 after a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes was reported the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan quickly spread around the world within a very short period of time there are 55 million confirmed cases of covid-19 and 347587 covid-19 related deaths worldwide up to 27 may 2020 giving a crude case-fatality rate of approximately 722 supportive treatment is the mainstay of management as no antiviral therapy has been clinically proven to be effective against sars-cov-2 and no standard pharmacological treatment guidelines have been recommended by who4 sars-cov mers and sars-cov-2 are all zoonotic -coronaviruses that have crossed from animals to humans23 the origin of sars-cov is still a mystery and remains a controversial topic sars-cov is closely related to civet and bat covs but it is phylogenetically divergent from other coronaviruses associated with human infections including oc43 nl63 229e and hku19 the full-length genome sequence of sars-cov-2 shows that it is similar to sars-cov sharing 796 sequence identity24 both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov use the same cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 receptor to enter into host cells24 the pathophysiology of covid-19 has yet to be confirmed but it is likely to involve inflammatory processes that can trigger a massive cytokine storm the cytokine profile of critically ill patients revealed increased levels of interleukin il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor interferon- inducible protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- and tumour necrosis factor-25 histopathological examination of the lungs of patients with covid-19 revealed immunopathological changes including diffuse alveolar damage desquamation of pneumocytes pulmonary oedema hyaline membrane formation and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates26 according to the limited number of reports of biopsyautopsy results of patients with covid-19 the pathological features resemble those seen in sars and mers virus infections2628 the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 suggest that the development of potential prophylactics and therapeutics for covid-19 could be based on research on sars312192932 an important strategy would be to possibly control the viral replication using an effective antiviral agent to minimise the subsequent inflammation and tissue damage due to high viral loads immunomodulators could play a rescue therapy role as pathological findings suggest that there is immunopathological damage926 although the sars-cov-2 s protein receptor-binding domain has higher affinity than the sars-cov s protein receptor-binding domain development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 could still be based on research on sars-cov3335 the majority of covid-19 patients especially children are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and will likely recover by managing their own symptoms without the need for hospitalisation36 according to the report by the who-china joint mission on coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 out of 55924 patients in china with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 only 138 had severe symptoms including dyspnoea respiratory frequency 30minute blood oxygen saturation 93 pao2fio2 ratio 300 andor infiltrates 50 of the lung field within 2448 hours whereas 61 were critical including respiratory failure septic shock and multiple organ dysfunctionfailure37 at present there is no proven effective therapy against sars-cov-2 however patients who are severely or critically ill might consider experimental therapies at the time of writing there are 1135 registered covid-19 clinical trials of which 657 are intervention studies using new therapies but only about 260 trials are beyond phase i38 the who has also launched the solidarity international clinical trial which is investigating effective treatments and is currently comparing four of the most promising treatment options remdesivir lopinavirritonavir lopinavirritonavir plus interferon -1a and hydroxychloroquine39 over 90 countries have joined the solidarity international clinical trial39 in the following discussion we summarise the latest evidence and research progress from the literature with focus on pharmacological therapies table 1 empirical antimicrobials should be started within 1 hour after the detection of sepsis based on clinical diagnosis and local epidemiology4 for critically ill covid-19 patients intensive care treatment can include oxygen therapy noninvasive mechanical ventilation invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation40 in addition to the standard management for acute respiratory distress syndrome the literature also suggests lower intubation threshold early prone positioning and cautious fluid status management considering that the incidence of myocardial dysfunction in covid-19 patients is high41 further discussion on the intensive care management of covid-19 patients is beyond the scope of this review remdesivir gs-5734 is a nucleoside analogue prodrug that inhibits viral rna polymerases and was developed by gilead science in response to the ebola outbreak in 20174244 it is considered to be one of the most promising broad-spectrum antivirals for treating covid-19 in vitro antiviral activities of remdesivir have been demonstrated in sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-24546 in early april a preliminary report describing the clinical outcomes of a cohort of 53 hospitalised covid-19 patients who received remdesivir 68 of patients showed improvement of their oxygen-support status but 60 of patients reported adverse events during follow-up42 subsequently a double-blinded randomised controlled trial in 237 adult patients with severe covid-19 showed that remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits whilst adverse events were reported in 66 of patients47 separately the results of an interim analysis of the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial involving 1063 patients are more encouraging as it indicated that patients who received redmesivir had a 31 faster time to recovery than those who received placebo median time to recovery was 11 versus 15 days48 more recently a phase 3 simple clinical trial demonstrated that patients receiving a 5-day and 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvements in clinical status49 common adverse events reported in the preliminary studies included elevated hepatic enzymes diarrhoea constipation hypoalbuminaemia rash renal impairment anaemia thrombocytopenia and hypotension4247 potential drugdrug interactions with other medications metabolised through the cytochrome p450 system were also reported the safety profile of this drug needs to be further evaluated randomised controlled trials on remdesivir are still ongoing and two studies are in phase iii of clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir5053 lopinavirritonavir is a combination therapy used to treat hiv ritonavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 and is used to increase the plasma half-life of lopinavir54 lopinavir is a protease inhibitor that has been demonstrated to have antiviral effects against sars mers-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro5455 several trials have been investigating the efficacy of lopinavirritonavir compared with other drugs as a treatment for covid-19395658 nevertheless the results so far indicate that lopinavirritonavir treatment has little benefit as a standalone therapy against sars-cov-2 infection in a clinical trial involving 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection lopinavirritonavir treatment was not associated with any clinical improvements compared with standard care54 furthermore lopinavirritonavir treatment caused gastrointestinal adverse events and nearly 14 of the recipients could not complete the full 14-day course of treatment54 other adverse effects included gastrointestinal intolerance hepatotoxicity pancreatitis and qt prolongation the use of ritonavir can cause severe drugdrug interactions in medications metabolised through the cytochrome system the tolerance of the side effects might limit the dosage needed as the concentration necessary to inhibit viral replication is relatively high54 other clinical trials have been testing lopinavirritonavir combined with different drugs and different combinations such as ritonavir and interferon 1b3956 early use of lopinavirritonavir as an additional treatment to ritonavirmethylprednisolone for sars-cov was associated with a reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate when compared with a matched cohort59 a clinical phase ii trial has been investigating the use of lopinavirritonavir combined with interferon -1b as a treatment for mers since 2016 but the trial is ongoing and results have yet to be published60 ribavirin is a guanosine analogue that interferes with the replication of rna and dna viruses61
in vitro antiviral activities of ribavirin have been demonstrated in sars-cov and mers-cov6162 from the experiences of sars-cov the use of ribavirin as a monotherapy was limited as it required high concentration to inhibit viral replication and ribavirin usage was associated with dose-dependent haemolysis and liver toxicity6364 in the treatment of sars and mers ribavirin is used in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir1165 the use of ribavirin in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir is recommended in the latest chinese national treatment guidelines for covid-1966 a recent multicentre randomised phase 2 trial showed triple antiviral therapy of lopinavirritonavir ribavirin and interferon -1b was superior to lopinavirritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild-to-moderate covid-1967 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are widely used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases these drugs have an established safety profile and are readily available at relatively low cost hydroxychloroquine sulphate has been demonstrated to be less toxic than chloroquine phosphate in animal studies68 both these drugs have been reported to have antiviral effects against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro their potential mechanisms of action include blocking viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors reducing viral replication and blocking the export of newly constructed virions4569 a trial in china involving more than 100 patients with covid-19 showed that chloroquine was better able to inhibit exacerbation of pneumonia and improve lung imaging findings compared to the control treatment70 a recent small open-label nonrandomised clinical trial showed patients given daily hydroxychloroquine had significantly reduced viral load measured by nasopharyngeal swab on day 65 however the results in this study may have been confounded by other factors as some patients also received azithromycin71 the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should be used with caution in patients at risk for qt prolongation the use of chloroquine alone is also a risk factor for qt prolongation a phase iib clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of high-dose chloroquine was terminated early due to prolonged qtc 500 ms and high lethality in the high-dose group compared to the low-dose group72 a recent analysis of a multinational registry of 96032 hospitalised covid-19 patients revealed that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine was associated with decreased in-hospital survival mortality of 111 versus 93 and increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmia73 however concerns have been raised about the veracity of data and analyses in this study and has led to retraction of the article74 other adverse effects of chloroquine include retinopathy rash nausea glucose fluctuation and diarrhoea and use of chloroquine is contraindicated in patients with porphyria chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should not be used to treat covid-19 until they have been tested in clinical trials to determine the optimal dosage to balance efficacy and safety chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as candidate prophylactics for covid-19 in populations at high risk of covid-19 infections such as italy and new york75 other antiviral treatments for covid-19 currently undergoing clinical trials include protease inhibitors nelfinavir camostat mesilate ritonavir danoprevir darunavir flavopiridol relacatib nucleoside analogues galidesivir fusion inhibitors umifenovir rna polymerase inhibitors favipiravir and neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir76 corticosteroid therapies such as intravenous methylprednisolone are currently being tested as a treatment for covid-1977 methylprednisolone has already been used in covid-19 patients in combination with antibiotics oseltamivir and oxygen therapy25 long and colleagues reported that corticosteroid therapy using methylprednisolone dexamethasone and hydrocortisone was beneficial in treating sars-cov patients78 and significantly prolonged survival time in clinical cases78 however other studies reported the use of corticosteroids in early stages of sars infection increased the viral load79 furthermore studies on the use of corticosteroids as an adjuvant therapy against mers-cov infection were unable to prove efficacy because all patients died80 based on the recommendation by frontline chinese physicians and local clinical experience during the sars epidemic a short course of corticosteroids at a low-to-moderate dose is probably justifiable for critically ill patients6681 corticosteroids are effective in treating the autoinflammatory cytokine activation syndrome reported side effects such as osteonecrosis are concerning but data are still conflicting and recent recommendations against the use of corticosteroids are based on circumstantial evidence routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended as corticosteroids may prolong or worsen the disease and were found to prolong viral shedding in mers and sars based on the current body of evidence corticosteroids may be justified for certain medical indications ie acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis at the discretion of the physician in charge convalescent plasma might be promising as a postexposure prophylaxis for covid-19 and as a potential treatment after infection as it was also used as a salvage therapy in the sars and mers epidemics8284 considering the huge number of people exposed to covid-19 use of convalescent plasma for post-exposure prophylaxis may not be justifiable but could still be a treatment option an observational study during the sars epidemic showed a lower mortality rate in those receiving convalescent plasma as a treatment for sars82 studies on the clinical effects and outcomes of critically ill covid-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma have so far shown encouraging results although it should be noted that these studies were based on small case series8586 furthermore studies on the use of convalescent plasma in sars patients did not report any significant side effects8287 randomised trials on convalescent plasma therapy are still needed to eliminate the effects of other treatments and to investigate the safety and efficacy and optimal timing of administration highly purified preparations of neutralising antibodies against sars-cov-2 would be preferable as it would be safer and have higher activity but it might be technically difficult to mass produce84 several pharmaceutical companies are starting to develop hyperimmune immunoglobulins against covid-198889 the use of tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against il-6 has recently been suggested as a treatment for covid-19 patients at risk of cytokine storms90 tocilizumab is an il-6 inhibitor that may be effective in treating covid-1991 the level of il-6 was found to be correlated with the severity of covid-19 and levels of c-reactive protein lactate dehydrogenase d-dimer and t cells90 a retrospective study of 20 covid-19 patients receiving tocilizumab found that 75 of them had decreased oxygen requirement92 according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol from the china national health commission and state administration of traditional chinese medicine tocilizumab can be used in patients with extensive pulmonary lesions and in patients with increased il-6 levels66 clinical trials on the efficacy of intravenous tocilizumab as a treatment for covid-19 are ongoing9394 however serious adverse effects have been reported including gastrointestinal perforation anaemia hepatitis and infusion reaction tcm employs phytotherapeutic formulations and cultural concepts that originated more than 5000 years ago95 the use of tcm as a coadjuvant therapy in the early stage of the sars infection epidemic was reported to increase oxyhaemoglobin arterial saturation95 a cochrane review found that chinese herbs combined with western medicines in sars patients could improve symptoms quality of life and absorption of pulmonary infiltration as well as decrease the corticosteroid usage96 specific components such as glycyrrhizin baicalin and mol376 were shown to have anti-sars activities in vitro9799 over 85 of sars-cov-2 patients in china received tcm which has been reviewed by yang and colleagues100 the use of tcm was included in the chinese national treatment guidelines for covid-19 patients and was recommended for different stages and severity of disease table 266 however the effectiveness of tcm in treating covid-19 patients still remains unclear well-designed large-scale randomised double-blinded and placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of tcm before making any recommendations on their use in the management of patients with covid-19 other complementary therapies such as high doses of vitamins acupuncture and exercise have been suggested to promote health however there are no reports of specific targeted effects on coronaviruses and there are no randomised trials of complementary therapies as treatments for covid-19 several case series reported that combination therapy could be effective in treating patients with covid-19 patients101 a single-centre case series of 89 hospitalised patients with covid-19 54 non-icu and 35 icu patients treated with a combination therapy of moxifloxacin lopinavir interferon and methylprednisolone given to only icu patients showed good treatment effects and the mortality rate was less than 1101102 in another study of 51 covid-19 patients 10 196 patients treated with a combination of traditional chinese medicine interferon-a-1b lopinavir ritonavir and short-term 35 days corticosteroids had good treatment results and only one patient died103 in a case report of a 45-year-old woman with covid-19 treated with thalidomide 100 mg orally once a day and methylprednisolone 40 mg intravenously bid for 3 days then reduced to once a day for 5 days she had overall improved status increased oxygen index decreased symptoms of nausea and vomiting and lower cytokine levels101 however we cannot draw any definitive conclusions from this single case report as there was no control although the development of vaccines started towards the end of the 2003 sars epidemic as of 2020 there are still no approved vaccines for sars-cov the main obstacle to the development of a vaccine is funding many vaccines that show promising results at the preclinical stage require further investments from governments or the private sector to progress to clinical trials as sars has largely disappeared since 2004 and mers is primarily confined to saudi arabia and korea there is little urgency in developing vaccines for these coronaviruses and it would not be in the best interest of investors104 there were 33 candidate vaccines targeting sars-cov and 48 candidate vaccines targeting mers-cov but most only reached preclinical stages so far only two sars-cov and three mers-cov vaccines have reached the clinical trial stage105 nevertheless the previous sari outbreaks pale in comparison to the current covid-19 pandemic if vaccines for these previous coronaviruses had been successfully developed we could have tested their efficacy and safety for covid-19 investments in vaccines for coronaviruses might now seem minuscule compared to the economic and social fallout of the current pandemic the who has launched an international randomised trial of candidate vaccines against covid-19 at the time of writing there are 115 covid-19 vaccine candidates and at least five candidate vaccines have reached phase i clinical trials105106 many tcm could be used as alternative preventive treatments for covid-19 based on previous prevention studies in populations at high risk from sars and h1n1 influenza107 the use of tcm to prevent infectious disease epidemics has also been described in the ancient chinese medicine text huangdi neijing which was compiled over 2000 years ago the main principles of tcm are to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens disperse wind and discharge heat and resolve dampness prospective studies are needed to verify the efficacy and safety of tcm for the prevention of covid-19107 all the coronaviruses are similar in nature and have defined clinical presentations the lower prevalence of coronavirus diseases in children might be accounted for by the lower exposure and relatively mild clinical presentation in the paediatric population many of the mild and asymptomatic cases are often overlooked and therefore go undiagnosed comparing the immunopathology of sars-cov-2 infection between children and adults could reveal the pathology of the disease and might lead to possible treatment strategies for recurrent novel coronavirus infections there is currently no approved antiviral treatment for patients suspected of or confirmed with covid-19 research on the sars and mers epidemics and data from in vitro studies show that antiviral therapy may be beneficial antiviral therapies and adjunctive treatments should therefore be considered in covid-19 patients with the unstable clinical condition or clinical deterioration or in patients with comorbidities as the covid-19 situation develops we will learn more about the safety and efficacy of specific treatments and treatment recommendations are likely to change to reflect the latest evidence at the time of writing the most urgent issue is to curtail the spread of covid-19 vaccines could be the answer to this crisis but vaccines are likely many months away and will take time to scale-up and manufacture on a global scale in the meantime public health officials should be focusing on nonpharmaceutical interventions measures such as personal hygiene wearing masks in the general population social distancing surveillance programs for testing suspected cases early quarantine vigilant contact tracing and preventing healthcare-related transmission are key factors to stopping the covid-19 pandemic108 although a safe and effective treatment has yet to be found the sheer number of clinical trials that have started since the beginning of the epidemic is nothing short of impressive combining advanced technologies in the field of genomics and computer science potential treatments could be identified through machine learning complex molecular dynamics and artificial intelligence with the joint efforts of research communities around the world we are hopeful that an effective treatment or vaccine for covid-19 can be developed in the near future109 this pandemic should also raise the awareness in governments and pharmaceutical companies on the importance of continued funding for research in this area at the same time healthcare systems and infrastructures should be reviewed for suitability and preparedness in dealing with future pandemics sars-cov-2 is the third re-emergence of a coronavirus in the past two decades and has abruptly put a halt to most social and economic activity around the world the consequences of which are immeasurable122 this pandemic will undoubtedly change our daily habits and social routines and should serve as a huge wake-up call that has shown the vulnerability of the human race for now the global battle against covid-19 continues and together we will inevitably defeat the coronavirus hard lessons will be learned that will better prepare us for the next pandemic  two middle east respiratory syndrome vaccines first step for other coronavirus vaccines kayvon modjarrad jerome kim h   since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 the emergence and expansion of endemic and epidemic coronaviruses has been accelerating on a scale not seen for any other group of viruses with pandemic potential in the past two decades alone five new human coronaviruses have been discovered three of which are highly pathogenic1 2 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic is just the latest example of the danger posed by zoonotic diseases foreshadowed by the regional but unabated emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov3 in recognition of its intrinsic threat to public health and as a prototypical member of the family coronaviridae who in 2015 prioritised mers-cov as a pathogen to which increased resources should be dedicated for countermeasure research and development the newly established coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations followed suit with investments in the development of candidate mers-cov vaccines4 in subsequent years three vaccine candidates have completed initial clinical evaluation and are now ready for advanced testing5 6 7 8 9
 in the lancet infectious diseases two groups8 9 report results from phase 1 clinical trials of non-replicating viral vector mers-cov vaccines pedro folegatti and colleagues8 summarise the safety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine chadox1 mers and till koch and colleagues9 do the same for a poxvirus-vectored vaccine mva-mers-s the two vaccines demonstrated tolerable safety profiles no vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported for either vaccine and induced humoral and cellular immune responses at peak post-vaccination timepoints chadox1 mers was administered as a single injection whereas mva-mers-s was given as a two-dose regimen with a 28-day interval between doses both products were tested in a dose-escalating design although the frequency and severity of adverse events were proportional to vaccine dose in both studies only higher doses of chadox1 mers improved immunogenicity a single dose of chadox1 mers also showed an earlier ascent and slower decay of antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity than two doses of mva-mers-s while noting that binding antibody levels are reported differently between these studies a single dose of chadox1 mers vaccine induced detectable antibody titres at day 180 in 18 75 of 24 participants and day 364 13 68 of 19 participants after vaccination whereas with mva-mers-s only three 14 of 22 vaccine recipients had detectable antibody titres at day 180 differences in the magnitude kinetics and character of the elicited immune responses raise common concerns for the development pathway of outbreak vaccines against mers-cov and more acutely sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 interrogation of the humoral and cellular immune profiles of the vaccine candidates highlights the first point what immune responses do coronavirus vaccines need to elicit to confer protection against infection or severe disease although the question is applicable to many viruses the answer to this question has been elusive among coronaviruses10 11 without previous identification of a potential correlate of protection it becomes difficult to ascertain the relevance of immunogenicity outputs second there remains a lack of consensus on the methodology by which immunogenicity outputs are measured12 although the two trials report similar assessments of humoral responsesbinding antibody wild-type mers virus and pseudovirus neutralisation assaysit is difficult to know how these individual results compare between studies koch and colleagues9 found a strong correlation between binding and neutralising antibody titres spearmans correlation r086 95 ci 0696009427 p00001 whereas folegatti and colleagues8 did not spearmans r028 p0175 does this represent an immunologically relevant difference between vaccine-induced responses or a methodological difference between laboratories finally some animal studies suggest that certain sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines might upon viral challenge be associated with eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates this finding underscores the importance of factoring safety into the design monitoring and long-term follow-up of coronavirus vaccine trialssomething that cannot be fully addressed in the two early-stage mers vaccine trials herein but which will undoubtedly be considered in future efficacy trials the experience with sars and the emergence of mers particularly during the outbreaks of 201415 in the arabian and korean peninsulas were harbingers of the consequences of covid-19 and similar pathogens on all sectors of societynot only in overall morbidity and mortality but also in the capacity to level economies and disrupt social order13 if mers has been eclipsed by its pandemic cousin then the lessons learned have prepared the global vaccine research and development community for moving coronavirus vaccines forward at an accelerated pace such that first-in-human covid-19 vaccine trials are moving on unprecedented shortened timelines to stay ahead of these increasingly frequent outbreaks the field must maintain momentum in advancing rapid scalable and translatable vaccine strategies not only for mers-cov but even more urgently for sars-cov-2 and ultimately the next novel coronavirus that leaps from its animal host to humans
