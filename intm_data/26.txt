all over the world severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 has been the most important public health issue this year recently this was re-named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who sars-cov-2 is also included in the coronavirus family along with sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov 1 covid-19 was first reported in wuhan china 23 in december 2019 since then covid-19 has spread rapidly all over the world 4 and has killed more than 226000 people worldwide so far this rapid spread is suspected via not only human-to-human but also interspecies transmissions 5 the who declared a pandemic on march 11according to the early studies the most common symptoms are known as fever cough difficulty in breathing sputum and sore throat 67 in fact however many patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms in early stages and so they do not realize being infected since covid-19 is highly contagious in early stages such lack of recognition can cause serious problems for the prevention of the spread of covid-19 therefore detection of covid-19 in early even asymptomatic stages will help us reduce transmissionrecently olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is often reported as a symptom 89 we need to pay more attention because the symptom might be easily overlooked in clinical field and so the diagnosis could be delayed in this review we reviewed recent findings of the viral infection-related olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions to identify a correlation between the olfactory or gustatory symptoms and corona virus and the values of olfactory dysfunction as an early sign of covid-19 even in asymptomatic patientswe searched the articles using pubmed and embase the first keyword was viral infection coronavirus rhinovirus influenza covid sars or mers the second keyword was anosmia smell or olfactory the full search strategy has been reported in table table 1
the articles that could not be obtained in the full text did not mention relationship between viral infection and olfactory function directly were not written in english and were the duplicated papers by the same author were excluded using endnote x9 software to date 23th april 2020 we could find 85 papers which mentioned viral infection and olfactory function among them 26 papers described relationship between olfactory symptoms and coronavirus infection including sars 40 papers described a relationship between olfactory symptoms and other viral infection including cytomegalovirus herpes virus influenza and othersfinally we could find 21 papers that directly described covid-19 and olfactory symptoms some of them also mentioned gustatory dysfunction or ageusia from these 21 papers 7 papers were clinical studies and others were commentary letters and editorial review fig 1
 the details of these 7 articles were demonstrated in table table 2
 a study reported patients who initially complained of acute onset anosmia not covid-19 infection but finally diagnosed with covid-19 infection 10there were no restrictions for gender age and nationality the studies with inclusion criteria were checked independently by 2 reviewers reviewers apply inclusion criteria based on the title and abstracts if the title and abstract were adequate the full text was checked by the same reviewersthe common symptoms in covid-19 patients were cough fever myalgia dyspnea headache and loss of appetite the most common ent symptoms were facial pain and nasal congestion 9however it has been recently reported that 339 of 59 covid-19 patients in italy complained of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction and 11 complained of both dysfunctions 11 47 of 114 covid-19 patients in france complained anosmia 12 3165 and 3544 of 79 covid-19 patients in spain complained olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions these proportions were more prominent in covid-19 patients than influenza patients 13 according to the paper from usa reported that 68 and 71 of 59 patients had olfactory and gustatory dysfunction respectively 14 98 of 60 patients from iran were confirmed smell dysfunction by university of pennsylvania smell identification test upsit 15 and few articles said that covid-19 patients without severe symptoms complained these olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions according to the larger-scale research from europe 856 of the 417 mild-to-moderate covid-19 patients had olfactory dysfunctions and 888 gustatory dysfunctions phantosmia and parosmia were 126 and 324 respectively among the patients who did not complain of nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea the rates of anosmia and hyposmia were 662 and 135 9 from the other italian article 644 of 202 mild symptomatic covid-19 patients were reported alternations in smell or taste about 37 of them complained severe alternations 683 of covid-19 patients with smell or taste alternations reported fatigue and 346 reported nasal stuffiness 16contrary to the above papers only 51 of 214 patients complained of hyposmia and 56 hypogeusia in china 8 considering the papers the rate of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is supposed to be different between europeusa and china or asiaanother issue is the onset of olfactory dysfunction which varied among many papers the onset of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in the clinical course of covid-19 might be important a multicenter study in europe showed that 856 and 88 of total patients n  417 reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions respectively and 118 of covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction appeared before other general symptoms 654 after the general symptoms and 228 at the same time 9 in italy 203 of covid-19 patients reported olfactory dysfunction before other general symptoms and 135 during hospitalization 11 from the other study of italy 119 of covid-19 patients n  130 complained of smell or taste alternations prior to other symptoms and 267 after other symptoms 16 in iran 83 of 23 covid-19 patients with anosmia complained of anosmia as their primary symptom 17 in spain 355 among 31 covid-19 patients complained early and 677 showed acute onset of olfactory dysfunction 13however according to another study from iran all of 21 covid-19 patients reported olfactory dysfunction with or immediately after the other general symptoms 15 in case of sars-cov infection complete anosmia was usually reported 3 weeks after the first symptom 18the other issue is the correlation of olfactory dysfunctions with otolaryngologic symptoms the olfactory dysfunction is not closely correlated with nasal stuffiness and rhinorrhea but it is supposed to be related to fever 9 in china only 4 of patients with olfactory dysfunction complained of rhinorrhea 19 and only 5 nasal stuffiness 20 from the recent survey study of 2428 patients with new onset anosmia in united kingdom 17 of anosmia patients had only anosmia without any other otolaryngologic symptoms however this survey has limited value because only 80 patients had been tested for covid-19 infection only 74 of the tested patients were positive and most of the responders were young 10from a case report olfactory dysfunction was described as isolated sudden onset anosmia because a patient with confirmed covid-19 complained of sudden onset anosmia without any other symptoms 21 according to the other study from italy 3 of covid-19 patients n  130 reported smell or taste alternations as the sole symptom 16 however there is also an article reporting that ent symptoms can be accompanied by anosmia 12in korea korean center for disease control kcdc recently on 6 april 2020 announced in a press release that proportion of asymptomatic case was 333 based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation of covid-19 10284 confirmed as positive among 466804 tested in republic of korea until 6 april 2020 22there is a study showing that most of gustatory dysfunction appeared as an early symptom before hospitalization 11 besides there might be close correlation between olfactory and gustatory dysfunction p0001 9 considering above around 2030 covid-19 patients may present olfactory dysfunction andor gustatory dysfunction as early or sometimes isolated symptom of covid-19curiously many studies showed that women had olfactory dysfunction more frequently than men 9111217 though the reason is hard to be explained at this time according to a recent study toll-like receptor tlr activation with cytokine production and protein phosphorylation is related to x chromosomes this might explain different inflammatory conditions and clinical courses after infection between men and women 23 however from another study the results of upsit checked olfactory function were same between men and women 15 further investigations of gender difference are neededglobally particularly in europe the olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions of covid-19 patients were reported as new symptoms however to date many papers have reported that the olfactory dysfunction has also occurred by other viral infections over 200 different viruses 24 2526 furthermore coronavirus family including sars is also related to post-viral anosmia 18 although the exact mechanism is not yet known 2 basic mechanisms have been suggestedfirst conductive olfactory dysfunction can be induced if there are some problems on olfactory cleft mucosa such as mucosa inflammation or rhinorrhea 27 olfactory dysfunction in viral infection with rhinovirus parainfluenza epstein-barr viruses and some other coronavirus can be explained however in some cases even if the acoustic rhinometry result was normal the olfactory function did not recover 28 olfactory dysfunction of covid-19 patients is also thought to be less related to rhinorrhea or nasal congestionsecond if there are direct effects by virus on olfactory cleft mucosa sensorineural olfactory dysfunction can be considered 29 direct mucosal infection by virus can cause severe injury of peripheral olfactory neuron which might have fetal effects on olfactory receptors 30 also both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 might have the potential of microinvasion to the target receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor which is expressed on the olfactory bulb and the epithelial cell of oral mucosa 31 however the effects of virus on sensorineural olfactory dysfunction are controversial from one study it claims that sars-cov might affect neurons in the olfactory bulb of mice and spread to the cortex basal ganglia and midbrain 32 on the other hand there is another case report of the sars-cov patients presenting with anosmia showed normal on brain magnetic resonance imaging mri scan 18 there is also a case of covid-19 patient who showed the bilateral inflammatory mucosal obstruction of the olfactory cleft without other abnormalities in nasal cavity and olfactory bulb on computed tomographic scan ct and mri scan 33as mentioned earlier there are differences in the olfactory and otolaryngologic symptoms of chinese and european patients 19 and it might be due to the diversity and mutation of ace2 phenotypes 3435the validated tests which could quickly and accurately diagnose the olfactory dysfunction in the highly suspicious covid-19 patients are needed the short version of the questionnaire of olfactory disorders negative statements sqod-ns can be used to assess the quality of life of the covid-19 patients with anosmia or hyposmia 9 the score was significantly lower in patients with anosmia than hyposmia or normosmiabesides subjective questionnaires commonly used olfactory tests are as follows upsit cross-cultural smell identification test cc-sit sensonic inc haddon heights nj tt olfactometry test daiichi yakuhin sangyo tokyo japan and other olfactory threshold tests 36 recently few cases of covid-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction were confirmed by upsit there was no correlation between upsit result and awareness of olfactory dysfunction in covid-19 patients 15also acoustic rhinometry rhinomanometry ct or mri could identify the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction mainly due to conductive problems and identify other causes however the usage of nasal endoscopy is not recommended in the highly suspicious covid-19 patients because it may provide other people unnecessary virus exposure 37in general spontaneous recovery rates have been reported higher in post-viral patients than post-traumatic patients and there are no definite treatment guidelines in the post-viral patients presenting with olfactory or gustatory dysfunction including covid-19 there are 2 issues on anosmia treatment in covid-19 patientsthe first issue is that early anomia treatment in covid-19 patients can change clinical course of covid-19 but due to lack of information this issue is hard to be answered but early detection appears more likely to be meaningful rather than early treatment for covid-19 the second one is whether empirical oral steroid treatment for acute anosmia can do harm to covid-19 patients without any other symptom or with mild symptomsup to date several studies have shown that oral steroid treatment for anosmia by viral infection may be effective through reducing mucosal inflammation and edema 38 there is a controversy over the effectiveness of the use of empirical systemic corticosteroids because oral steroids may aggravate immunosuppressive state in the covid-19 patients with severe symptoms and there are studies showing that use of corticosteroids in mers patients may have affected the delay of rna reduction in mers coronavirus 39moreover in cases of the covid-19 patients with severe lung complications the use of corticosteroids is not recommended by who guideline 40 in china however limited use of low dose corticosteroid during short-term can be permitted when absolutely necessary 41according to the recently released aria eaaci statement it is recommended to keep using intranasal steroid ins in the covid-19 patients with allergic rhinitis 40 although it may be revised later with new studies it is also recommended to maintain the use of local intranasal corticosteroids because sneezing could get worse and the virus could spread easily if the patients stop using insins is supposed to have relatively less risky than systemic steroids because the rate of systemic bioavailability of ins is less than 1 42 but further studies are needed to confirm if ins may be effective for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction and for the change of clinical course in the covid-19 patientsit was reported that the treatments used for olfactory dysfunction were nasal saline irrigations 167 nasal corticosteroids 81 oral corticosteroids 25 and others 25 however in actual clinical field most of the patients with olfactory dysfunction did not receive any treatment 9olfactory training simple and easy can bring positive results on the recovery for anosmia by viral infection but there is no definite guideline for olfactory training in the covid-19 patients but a few papers recommend that early olfactory training before 12 months from the onset of anosmia could have positive results in the patients with anosmia and viral infection including covid-19 3743besides steroid and olfactory training zinc sulfate theophylline ginkgo biloba vitamins nasal decongestants or other medicine could also be considered to treat olfactory dysfunction saline washing nasal saline irrigation should be considered carefully because it could make virus more contagious 9 however except for the corticosteroid the effects of other medicine have not been proven 37most of the patients with gustatory dysfunction did not have any special treatment either using l-carnitine or vitamins 9the recovery of olfactory function is relatively slower in sensorineural dysfunction than conductive olfactory dysfunction and permanent functional loss might be caused 21there are a few studies for the recovery of olfactory function in covid-19 infected patients yet in usa 74 of 38 cured patients from covid-19 were reported to show the recovery of anosmia 14 in france mean duration of anosmia was within 2 weeks and 55 of 44 patients recovered more after 1week and 20 recovered more after 2 weeks in spain mean duration of anosmia was also within 2 weeks and 40 of 30 patients recovered completely around 1 week later 74  23 days 13 according to the study from europe a total of 357 patients 856 had olfactory dysfunction from a total of 417 covid-19 infected patients but among 59 clinically cured patients only 44 is reported to show the recovery of olfactory function in short term period within 14 days most of whom 726 of patients with recovered olfactory dysfunction showed a recovery within 8 days only a small number of patients 34 showed a recovery more than 15 days after the covid-19 resolution among the clinically cured patients who had residual olfactory andor gustatory dysfunction 539 complained of only olfactory dysfunction 225 only gustatory dysfunction and 236 both remaining olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions 9the time to decide the recovery of olfactory function was suggested to be 2 weeks because the viral loading significantly reduces in about 14 days 944 but the further study requires to decide the time to recovery and follow up long term laterconsidering from the other viral infections the partial or complete recovery of olfactory function could take several months 45 and in case of anosmia after sars the patient was reported to suffer from anosmia continuously more than 2 years 18the ongoing covid-19 epidemic is still rapidly spreading all over the world so it is very important to notice the early sign of covid-19 and get the information about progression as soon as possible most of covid-19 patients complain of no symptoms or mild symptoms in early stages though coughing fever and difficulty breathing are main symptomsup to date the number of the covid-19 patients with olfactory andor gustatory symptoms is rapidly increasing and though the onset of olfactory andor gustatory symptoms in the covid-19 patients was reported varied in general most of these 2 symptoms might precede or be accompanied by other main mild general symptoms or no other symptoms 16 moreover many cases 182 have been reported for the covid-19 patients to complain of these 2 symptoms suddenly without any other otolaryngologic symptoms like rhinorrhea or nasal obstructions 9based on the previous paper the rates of asymptomatic cases out of all sars-cov positive cases were reported 13 among singaporean health care workers 46 furthermore according to who report for mers-cov 21 of the 2228 cases from all over the world were reported to have no or mild symptoms 47asymptomatic case proportion of covid-19 was 333 based on the presence or absence of symptoms at the time of confirmation which was higher than sars-cov and mers-cov according to kcdc report on 6 april 2020 22therefore we should pay more attention to olfactory andor gustatory symptoms in the suspicious covid-19 patients with or without the main covid-19 symptoms because asymptomatic covid-19 infection andor transmission is a major public health issue at present however the exact rate of asymptomatic covid-19 all over the world has not known and further analysis should be doneeven though the pathophysiologic mechanism of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions in covid-19 patients has not been clearly identified yet it is also very interesting that the clinical manifestations of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions were different according to gender or racesmoreover it is necessary to follow the clinical course and the long-term results of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions in the cured covid-19 patientsalthough there is still a lack of our understanding of covid-19 the number of covid-19 patients is rapidly increasing all over the world based on the recent reports and studies sudden olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions may be the early signs of covid-19 though all olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions are not caused only by covid-19 even at present therefore if there are any persons complaining of olfactory andor gustatory dysfunctions in covid 19 pandemic areas it is suggested that accurate and urgent diagnostic test for covid-19 should be applied by doing so health providers can get an opportunity to prepare personal protective equipment in advance and isolate the suspected asymptomatic patients or with mild symptom to prevent the further spread of covid-19the authors have no financial conflicts of interestsevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is a major public health challenge to human beings in the beginning of the 21st century as of july 11 2003 sars has been described in 32 countries involving 8437 individuals and causing 813 deaths1 although the immediate crisis surrounding sars now is subsiding the threat of recurrence remains possible even though the cause of sars has been identified as coronavirus2 3 the accuracy of the currently available rapid assays is not well established4
because sars is highly contagious early suspicion of the disease according to clinical presentation still plays a significant role in timely diagnosis previous studies have described the major clinical symptoms of sars5 6 but these reports were inadequate in 2 areas first retrospective data collected by medical record review or patient interviews long after presentation introduced recall bias second summary of symptoms without description of the detailed time sequence of each symptom provides little help for clinical decisionmaking when physicians are confronted with patients presenting with a constellation of symptomsthis prospective study was designed to chronicle the time sequence of symptom development in probable sars cases in comparison to febrile non-sars cases it depicts a more clearly clinical course of sars and identifies a few symptom-based diagnostic clues that may guide clinicians in the early diagnosis of sars in endemic areasaccording to the global alert from the who patients with sars present with fever airway symptoms and risks of exposure such as recent travel to an affected area or close contact with sars patients including their families or health care providers although the possible associated symptoms had been described in the who web site at that time the detailed time sequence of various symptom developments was not clarified from clinical observations of the sars patients we theorized that the sars-related symptoms present in a distinctive time sequence compared with those of non-sars febrile patients and this information could help clinicians in the early recognition of the diseasethis prospective observational study was approved by the hospitals institutional review boardthe study was conducted in an academic tertiary hospital in taipei taiwan from march 14 through may 12 2003patients presenting to the ed with risks of exposure and temperature of 380c or greater 1003f were enrolled initially the risks of exposure included traveling to an affected area within the previous 2 weeks contact history with known sars patients or both however after taiwan became an endemic area after the outbreak in a municipal hospital and community spread of the virus all febrile patients presenting to the ed were considered coming from a sars-affected area and meeting our enrollment criteria fever was defined as body temperature greater than 380c 1003f either at home or at the ed patients with only subjective chills or sweating without documented fever were not enrolledall patients were evaluated by emergency physicians using a structured recording form designed by the principal investigators items in the questionnaire included baseline demographic data travel and contact history the occurrence and time sequence of various symptoms before presentation to the ed ancillary laboratory tests and chest radiography details of the occurrence of each of the 8 symptom items were obtained and recorded lower respiratory symptoms included cough and shortness of breath diarrhea included loose stool because symptoms after hospitalization could be modified by various treatments they were not recordedthe outcome measures of the study were clinical symptoms over time among probable sars and non-sars patients probable sars or non-sars was determined by the center of disease control taiwan according to patients clinical courses and the who criteria defined on may 1 20037
the baseline demographic data initial laboratory tests and time sequence of symptoms were analyzed children younger than 15 years because of their different clinical presentation from that of the adults8 were excluded from final analysis the suspected sars cases by the who criteria with negative polymerase chain reaction results were also excluded from final analysisthe results of reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction were obtained from center of disease control taiwan seroconversion for sars coronavirus was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay means and sds were calculated as summaries of continuous variables for categorical variables percentages and 95 confidence intervals cis of patients in each category were computed for the analysis of symptom development we defined the first day with fever as day 0 and calculated the incidences of various symptoms with reference to day 0 for sars and non-sars patients data were entered into a microsoft excel database microsoft excel 2001 microsoft corporation seattle wa and analyzed with spss software for windows release 100 spss inc chicago ila total of 349 febrile patients were enrolled during the study twenty-nine patients younger than 15 years and 21 patients categorized as suspected sars cases whose reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction results were negative were excluded from final analysesthe demographic data of the 299 patients in the final analyses are shown in table 1 seventy-nine patients were judged as probable sars cases including 2 suspected cases with positive reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction test results for sars coronavirus the mean age of the sars group was 446 years interquartile range iqr 30 to 53 years there were 35 443 male patients and 44 557 female patients fifty-four 685 patients were infected because of exposure to sars in a hospital setting in 9 114 sars cases discovered after taiwan became a sars-affected area no risk of exposure could be identified reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction tests for sars coronavirus were used for 57 patients with 23 positive results 404 95 ci 028 to 053 seroconversion for sars coronavirus was demonstrated in 37 of 38 patients hospitalized in our hospital 974 95 ci 092 to 100 in the 220 non-sars febrile patients the average age was younger 378 years than that of the sars group the leading diagnosis was upper respiratory tract viral infection mean duration of fever in the sars group was 43 days 4322 days range 1 to 12 days before hospital presentation compared with 19 days 1915 days range 1 to 9 days in the non-sars group
initial vital signs and laboratory data in both groups are summarized in table 2 fever was documented on arrival at the ed in 59 268 of 220 non-sars patients and in 47 595 of 79 probable sars patients body temperature systolic and diastolic blood pressure wbc count neutrophil and lymphocyte count thrombocyte count serum level of aspartate aminotransferase sodium c-reactive protein and creatine kinase were significantly different between sars and non-sars groups the clinical symptoms more commonly found in the sars group were myalgia n52 658 95 ci 055 to 076 loose stool or diarrhea n36 456 95 ci 035 to 057 lower respiratory tract symptoms cough or dyspnea n36 456 95 ci 035 to 057 headache n18 228 95 ci 014 to 032 and chills n16 203 95 ci 011 to 029 upper respiratory symptoms including sore throat n3 38 95 ci 0 to 008 and rhinorrhea n2 25 95 ci 0 to 006 were rarely found in the sars cohort but were common in the non-sars cohort figure 1 initially infiltrations on chest radiography were found in 59 sars 747 95 ci 065 to 085 and 22 non-sars 99 95 ci 006 to 014 cases the final diagnoses of febrile non-sars cases with infiltration on chest radiography were bronchopneumonia pulmonary tuberculosis empyema and 1 newly diagnosed aids patient with pneumocystis carinii infection among the sars patients infiltration on chest radiography appeared more frequently than the presence of lower respiratory tract symptoms 747 versus 456
a detailed within-patient analysis of the time sequence of various symptoms in the sars cohort revealed that myalgia loose stool or diarrhea and fever were the 3 earliest symptoms figure 2 the appearance of myalgia and loose stool or diarrhea peaked on the same day or 1 day before fever whereas lower respiratory symptoms including cough and dyspnea occurred later in the clinical course appearing on an average of 317 sd 203 days after fever the non-sars group did not exhibit such characteristics as shown in figure 3
fifty-five 696 95 ci 060 to 080 sars patients compared with only 7 32 95 ci 0008 to 005 non-sars patients followed the abovementioned characteristic clinical course on the other hand only 6 76 95 ci 002 to 013 sars patients developed cough before or with onset of fever compared with 112 509 95 ci 044 to 058 non-sars patientsthere were a few limitations in the study first the duration of fever before hospitalization was self-reported and was subject to individual sensitivity to the change of body temperature however this limitation should not affect the chronologic sequence of various symptoms second symptoms after hospitalization were not included in our analysis although these later symptoms may be helpful in making the diagnosis of sars they may not be useful in making early diagnosis third the study was conducted in a single medical center in northern taiwan so the findings may not be extrapolated to other patients across the island however because the institution was the leading sars hospital during the outbreak reporting in total about 24 of the probable sars cases in taiwan the samples should be considered representativethe initial case definition of sars by the who focused on fever cough or dyspnea and exposure history it provided a diagnostic basis for physicians at the beginning of the outbreak but this definition has its limitations first when the disease became endemic rather than imported the contact history of some patients could not be traced creating a diagnostic difficulty second because cough is a nonspecific symptom describing the presence of cough only fails to be the benchmark used to discriminate sars from a variety of other respiratory tract infections third in the early stage febrile patients may have acquired the sars coronavirus without developing respiratory symptoms excluding the diagnosis of sars in this patient group according to the absence of cough exposes the community to the risk of further disease spreadthe results of the study supplement the description of clinical symptoms of sars issued by the who our study revealed that fever myalgia and loose stool or diarrhea were the earliest symptoms of sars upper respiratory tract symptoms such as coryza and sore throat previously reported to range from 223 to 355 9 were rare in our sars cohort similar findings were observed in the greater toronto area6 on the contrary coryza and sore throat were frequently mentioned symptoms in our control group the occurrence of upper respiratory tract symptoms might be useful in discriminating sars from common upper respiratory tract viral infection in the early stagethe timing of cough could be another useful feature to discriminate sars from non-sars cases although cough before or during fever is more likely to be associated with non-sars cases lower respiratory tract symptoms developing later on an average of 32 days in the clinical course would favor the diagnosis of sars furthermore in 32 405 95 ci 030 to 051 sars patients abnormal chest radiographic infiltrate was identified before the onset of lower respiratory tract symptoms the finding suggests that the absence of lower respiratory tract symptoms is not useful in ruling out sars and indicates the importance of chest radiographic examination in screening procedures9
although the sars and the non-sars groups were significantly different in many laboratory indices these results should be interpreted carefully in our study the sars patients had longer duration of fever before presenting to the ed than the non-sars patients the laboratory samples were obtained at different points of the disease course for the 2 groups with regard to the onset of fever these laboratory indices may be useful in diagnosis of sars at later course of the disease but not necessarily applicable to the early stage of the diseasethe high seroconversion rates against sars coronavirus 974 among our sars cohort suggested that most patients classified as having probable sars in this study actually had coronavirus infections meanwhile only 404 of sars patients in this study had positive reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction results although reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction is an important laboratory test and should be obtained for all patients with suspected sars it may not be useful and practical for screening purposesnearly 70 of the sars patients exhibited the characteristic time sequence of symptoms myalgia and loose stool or diarrhea around the onset of fever without coryza or sore throat followed by progressive lower respiratory tract symptoms similar clinical presentation was observed in only 32 of the control group the consistency of clinical presentation in most probable sars patients further substantiates the usefulness of careful history taking in the early differential diagnosis of sarsin retrospect we did not check the reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction and serologic data for sars coronavirus in febrile patients classified as low risk and non-sars because the ed was severely constrained in space and staff during the outbreak if such information could be available a subset of patients with minor or atypical presentations could have been identifiedthis study chronicles in detailed time sequence the early symptoms of the febrile probable sars and non-sars patients during the outbreak the characteristic presentation of fever accompanied by diarrhea and myalgia along with the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms followed by progressive respiratory symptoms should prompt the awareness of possible sars besides travel and contact history the time sequence of accompanying symptoms may help first-line physicians screen sars patients at an early stagesince december 2019 multiple cases of unexplained pneumonia have been reported in wuhan in chinas hubei province as the disease has spread cases of covid-19 have also been found across the whole of china and overseas nucleic acid detection of a patients respiratory secretions identified the source of infection to be a new type of coronavirus which was been defined as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 1 on 11 february 2020 the who officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 2 on february 22 2020 chinas national health commission announced the designation of the new coronavirus pneumonia as coronavirus disease the disease is a new type b infectious disease in accordance with the class a management infectious disease prevention and control law although there is considerable overlap between imaging manifestations of different viral pneumonia comprehensive analysis of clinical features epidemiology and laboratory examination results are of significance in improving the diagnosis of covid-19coronaviruses form a large rna virus family the surface of virus particles is covered in many spines and the virus particles as a whole resemble a crown which is the origin of the name coronavirus six subtypes have been found of these four are less pathogenic and generally lead to mild symptoms after infection two subtypes can cause severe infections the novel coronavirus is a new-type coronavirus that has not been previously been found in humans being it is now considered to be a seventh subtype but its genes have more than 85 homology with a sars-like virus in bats it has been speculated that the pathogenic mechanism of the virus may be that because the 2019-ncov receptor and sars-cov receptor binding region rbd structure domain between the amino acid sequence and the prediction of protein structure are highly similar 2019-ncov can effectively use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2ace2 on alveolar type ii epithelial cells as the receptor to invade cells thus entering the bronchial epithelial cells to replicate and cause disease 34current epidemiological investigations show the incubation period of covid-19 to range from one to fourteen days and in most cases to be three to seven days the main source of infection is patients infected with the novel coronavirus infection patients with asymptomatic infection incubation period can also be a source of infection infection is mainly spread by respiratory droplets and contact exposed mucus membranes and unprotected eyes increase the risk of infection and the detection of the virus in stool and urine samples from patients also suggests the possibility of fecal-oral transmission there is a possibility of aerosol transmission under the condition of prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment 5 6 7 at present there are no reports of vertical transmission from mother to childcovid-19 lacks specificity in both clinical manifestations and laboratory tests the main clinical manifestations of the disease are fever fatigue and a dry cough and in severe cases multiple organ failure 7 8 9 its atypical symptoms may include myalgia and diarrhea laboratory tests have shown that the total number of white blood cells in early peripheral blood is normal or has decreased and the lymphocyte count has progressively decreased c-reactive protein and serum sedimentation rates were increased in most patients 7 8 9 covid-19 was confirmed by viral nucleic acid detection with strong specificity and poor sensitivity 10 in order to improve the rate of positive nucleic acid detection it is recommended to retain sputum and lower respiratory secretions as far as possible and promptly submit them for examination 7 ct examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for covid-19 chest imaging in the early stage shows multiple plaque shadows and interstitial changes mostly seen in the peripheral lung and subpleural and then developed into multiple ground glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs in severe cases lung consolidation can occur presenting as white lung with rare pleural effusion and mediastinal lymph node enlargement 67ggo is a slightly higher density blurred image in the lungs where the pulmonary blood vessels are visible the pathological change of ggo is that the virus invades the bronchioles and alveolar epithelium and replicates in the epithelial cells causing the alveolar cavity to leak and the alveolar wall or the alveolar space to become inflamed or thickened with a distribution mainly around the lung and under the pleura 1314as inflammation progresses there is extensive involvement of alveoli and mucosal ulcers followed by consolidation when the body reacts strongly as to an inflammatory storm large exudation occurs in the alveoli of both lungs showing a white lung performance air bronchus sign refers to the phenomenon of dendritic low-density shadowing of air-containing bronchus in the consolidation of lung tissue which is more common in the progress of the disease the pathological basis is that the pathogen invades epithelial cells causing inflammatory thickening and swelling of the bronchial wall but without obstructing the bronchioles 15on high-resolution ct the lobular interval thickening and interlobular interval line shadows are superimposed on a ground glass-like opaque background they are called paving stones due to the resemblance of the forms to irregularly shaped paving stones the pathological changes are lobular intervals and interlobular interstitial thickening suggesting interstitial changesduring repair and healing of chronic inflammation or hyperplasia of the lung fibrous components gradually replace the normal cellular components to form scars fibrous lesions can cause distracted bronchi or bronchiectasis and distorted travelthickening vessels can be seen at the edge or the center of the lesion and are observable at various stages of the diseasethe density of the lesion is slightly higher at the center and slightly lower at the edges a thin circle of cloud-like ground glass shadow which varies in thickness and changes like a halo surrounds the lesion pathological changes may be virus replication in epithelial cells 16in diagnosis and treatment scheme for coronavirus disease trial version 6 infection is classified according to its clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations 7 there is a one-to-one correspondence between the imaging stage early advanced and severe and clinical classification mild general and severe in most patients with covid-19  early-stage and mild type mild patients have mild clinical symptoms and no significant imaging findings such as pneumonia performance  progressive stage and common type general type patients have fever respiratory tract symptoms and imaging shows pneumonia  severe stage and severe type patients with shortness of breath and hypoxemia the images mainly show diffuse lung lesions some of which manifest white lung changes the range of lesions within 2448 h significantly progresses 50 7 there are however some cases which do not comply to the above one-to-one correspondence  some cases have obvious imaging manifestations but the clinical symptoms are atypical fig 1
 among the close-contact cases diagnosed through screening as having covid-19 most patients had no obvious clinical symptoms at the initial diagnosis and the corresponding clinical symptoms appeared after a period of time a few patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms for a long period with the infection becoming invisible  however the images of the above cases did show pneumonia at the time of screening the signs of which were mainly ground glass and patchy shadows under the pleura or outside the lungs 1718  the clinical manifestations of some cases are typical and no obvious manifestations of pneumonia were found on imaging examination fig 2
 this may relate to the virus being mainly located in the upper respiratory tract and not causing exudative lesions in the lung such patients should be diagnosed isolated and treated early to prevent transmission of the virus  in some cases the clinical symptoms are relieved and the imaging manifestations have progressed fig 3
 19 the mismatch between clinical and imaging manifestations becomes a difficult problem for covid-19 diagnosis therefore comprehensive analysis of clinical data epidemiology and imaging performance is more helpful for the diagnosis of covid-19the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19 is a positive nucleic acid test with high specificity and a low sensitivity of 3050 20 it is common in clinical work to find that clinical and imaging findings support the diagnosis of covid-19 while multiple consecutive nucleic acid tests are negative fig 4
 it has been reported that up to eight nucleic acid tests have been negative in infected patients before covid-19 was finally diagnosed over-reliance on nucleic acid tests may lead to the misdiagnosis of patients who do in fact have covid-19 this is not conducive to the control of the epidemic preliminary data from a designated virus hospital in wuhan showed that the ct positive rate of clinically highly suspected cases was 90 while the positive rate of nucleic acid tests was about 40 this is due to the many factors which affect the nucleic acid test such as the course of infection viral load sampling method detection reagents and interpretation standards reagents in particular greatly affect the detection effect 21 therefore nucleic acid test cannot be a factor in restricting the accurate diagnosis and treatment of diseases the director of the radiology department of a hospital in wuhan strongly recommends ct scan as the main diagnostic and screening basis for covid-19 the diagnosis and treatment scheme for coronavirus disease trial version 5 6 specifically formulated clinical diagnosis standards for patients in hubei province and defined suspected cases with pneumonia imaging manifestations as clinical diagnostic cases which reduced the risk of further spreadwith the exception of the above cases some mild cases had no obvious imaging changes of pneumonia but the nucleic acid test was negative fig 5
 the use of imaging pneumonia as a prerequisite for the diagnosis of covid-19 may lead to clinicians focusing solely on patients with pneumonia and missing the diagnosis of infected patients who show no changes in pneumonia the diagnosis and treatment scheme for coronavirus disease trial version 4 stipulates that 22 a patient who meets any one of the epidemiological history criteria and any two of the clinical manifestations can be included in suspected cases and that an etiological test then be conducted such an approach is conducive to the detection of patients with covid-19 67chest radiographs are suitable for primary hospitals which do not have ct machines and for the bedside examination of critically ill patients ct tomography especially high-resolution ct has no overlapping structural interference and can detect small lesions early the value of a ct scan for covid-19 lies in it being the key technology for detecting the presence of lesions in the lungs the important basis for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of covid-19 detecting important warning signals for patients with negative virus nucleic acid test an important means to monitor covid-19 treatment outcome progression stability absorption an early detection of other complications the best follow-up method for patients following discharge 23 as mentioned above the ct scan occupies an important position in the diagnosis of covid-19 in clinical work however we must perform ct examinations without affecting the premise of diagnosis and we must not over-examine therefore based on the observation of existing cases and combined with clinical experience we recommend the following ct examination time window  newly diagnosed patients with typical clinical manifestations and positive nucleic acid tests with a negative chest ct scan at the initial diagnosis and a review of chest ct scan within 35 days  clinical diagnosis cases with atypical clinical manifestations and viral pneumonia characteristics in addition to repeated nucleic acid tests a chest ct is recommended for 57 days  non-critical confirmed cases a chest ct scan is recommended at 57 days 24unilateral or bilateral multiple ggo with or without consolidation located in the bronchovascular bundle or subpleural fig 6
 2526 it is difficult to distinguish the image from the new type of coronavirus pneumonia however the early stage of the new coronavirus pneumonia can be manifested as a small ground glass density shadow or a small flake of ground glass density shadow can be seen in the thickened blood vessel shadow this may be helpful for the early identification of h1n1 lesionscommon in children multifocal ggo in both lungs with patchy consolidation present a multisegmental pulmonary distribution trend fig 7
 atelectasis can occur in children it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish it from bacterial pneumonia 2526a common cause of seasonal respiratory infections imaging findings are varied and include multiple peribronchial nodules consolidation of ggo and aerated bronchi fig 8
 2526 the central distribution of the lesion is different from the characteristic subpleural distribution of new coronavirus pneumoniacommon in infants congenital defects immunosuppression and chronic lung disease the central lobular nodule is the most characteristic image and its occurrence rate is up to 50 fig 9
 which can be distinguished from the new coronavirus pneumonia in addition air consolidation 35 ggo 30 and bronchial wall thickening 30 are seen it is distributed in the central or surrounding area of the lung and presented bilateral asymmetric distribution 2526common in children and adolescents image presenting as central lobular nodules ground-glass opacity consolidation with thickening of bronchial wall bronchiole tree buds hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement 27 laboratory tests are positive for the mycoplasma antibodythere are no prodromal symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection cough purulent sputum bloody sputum or rust-colored sputum laboratory examination of increased white blood cell count imaging features of single leaf segment or sub segment consolidation shadow treatment with antibiotics is goodtypical manifestations are bilateral subpleural patchy ground-glass opacity or consolidation the air bronchi sign in some lesions the central ground-glass opacity marginal ring or crescent shape consolidation presents an anti-halo sign hilum and mediastinal lymph node enlargement as well as pleural effusion in a small number of cases 28diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs central lobe nodules with fuzzy edges mosaics perfusion and air retention in expiratory phase lung field in chronic stage shows fine mesh shape shadow and stretch extension the patient usually has a history of bird breeding or of occupational exposure 29the manifestations are multiple nodules with cavitation nodules connected to pulmonary vessels nourishing vascular signs halo or anti-halo signs multiple consolidation fiber cord shadow and ground glass density shadow diffuse distribution the subpleural area is rare it occurs mostly in the middle of the band with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage clinical manifestations can be hemoptysis and pleural effusion is common 30 a laboratory test of positive canca antibody is helpful in diagnosiscovid-19 is highly contagious and humans are generally susceptible to infection while clinical and ct scans do share certain characteristics there is some separation between a ct scan and a nucleic acid detection in some cases therefore comprehensive analysis of the patients epidemiological history laboratory test results clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations is necessary in order to effect early prevention early detection early diagnosis early isolation and early treatmentwritten informed consent was obtained from the patients for the publication of this report and any accompanying imagessince december 2019 an increasing number of pneumonia cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan hubei china and subsequently an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 swept the globe 14 as of february 3 2020 more than 23214 suspected cases and 20438 confirmed cases have been identified and there has been over 425 deaths related to the illness moreover the virus is still spreading at an alarming ratein this sudden epidemic reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr revealed the cause of the outbreak the sars-cov-2 can be specifically detected in respiratory secretions or plasma samples rt-pcr however some patients with likely covid-19 may have negative initial rt-pcr results for covid-19 which may be due to insufficient cellular material for detection or improper extraction of nucleic acids from clinical materials thus imaging examination which can effectively and conveniently observe the pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities can solve some challenges associated with clinical diagnosis in suspected patients with a false-negative result especially symptomatic patients with dyspnea and respiratory distressbecause this infection is caused by the unprecedented sars-cov-2 few related imaging studies have been currently reported among the studies that have been conducted multifocal consolidation or ground-glass opacity ggo was observed on chest radiographs and ct 57 however the sensitivity of chest radiographs for pneumonia are relatively low and it is difficult to use chest radiographs to distinguish covid-19 from common pneumonia during the cold season and pneumonia caused by other coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infections 8 in addition the disease is developing rapidly and the symptoms of this disease vary hence it is very necessary to systematically analyze the chest ct findings associated with this disease systematically for the timely isolation covid-19 rt-pcr and respiratory care of patients and early implementation of infection prevention and control measuresto fully understand and early discriminate the ct features of this disease in its early stages we collected initial chest ct data from confirmed covid-19 patients who did not receive any antiviral treatment mainly from chongqing three gorges central hospital for analysis the chongqing three gorges central hospital located in the northeast of chongqing and connected to hubei province is one of the designated hospitals for the centralized treatment of pneumonia patients infected by the sars-cov-2 and has received a large number of covid-19 patients therefore our aim was to systematically analyze the ct features of the early and progressive stages of the natural course of covid-19 and explore the possible pathological changes in the lung during different periods of this diseasethis retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of chongqing three gorges central hospital and the second affiliated hospital of chongqing medical university and the requirement for informed consent was waivedbetween january 21 and february 4 2020 totally 72 patients of confirmed covid-19 were enrolled ie 66 patients from chongqing three gorges central hospital and 6 patients from the second affiliated hospital of chongqing medical university all patients with covid-19 were diagnosed according to the world health organization who interim guidance 9 and were eventually confirmed by a positive result for rt-pcr analysis of the respiratory secretions samples confirmed patients were eligible if they experienced symptoms within 7 days underwent an initial chest ct examination and they had not received any antiviral treatment the exclusion criteria were as follows 1 patients who recently experienced clinically defined pulmonary infection attributable to other pathogens 2 patients with severe artifacts on ct images and 3 patients whose age was less than 18 years according to the exclusion criteria 7 patients who had pulmonary infections caused by other pathogens and 3 patients whose ct images had severe artifacts were excluded finally 62 confirmed covid-19 patients 34 men 28 women age range 2091 years old who had not received antiviral treatment were retrospectively reviewed the workflow of covid-19 patients selection is shown in fig 1 most cases had a history of sars-cov-2 exposure in the absence of medical staff or family clusters of sars-cov-2 infection the main symptom of patients was fever and secondary symptoms included cough expectoration dizziness nasal congestion and myalgia according to the changes in this disease over time 10 11 in our study we defined patients with an onset of symptoms within 4 days as the early-stage group 18 men 16 women age range 2072 years old and patients with an onset of symptoms within 57 days as the progressive-stage group 16 men 12 women age range 2291 years old all patients underwent ct scans and laboratory examinations for c-reactive protein crp white blood cell count neutrophil count lymphocyte count platelet count hemoglobin level and procalcitonin level on admissiondesignated independent operating rooms were used to perform the ct examinations of all confirmed patients and after each examination the operating room was sterilized with air disinfection method the initial chest ct data of 56 patients from chongqing three gorges central hospital were obtained by using a 16-slice spiral ct scanner emotion 16 vc20b siemens healthcare gmbh with the following scanning protocol a tube voltage of 120 kv smart ma tube current modulation a slice thickness of 15 mm and a detector width of 15 mm the initial chest ct data of the other 6 patients from the second affiliated hospital of chongqing medical university were obtained by using a 128-slice spiral ct scanner ingenuity ct philips healthcare with a similar scanning protocol a tube voltage of 120 kv smart ma tube current modulation a matrix size of 512  512 a slice thickness of 1 mm and a detector width of 0625 mm all patients were scanned in the supine position and at the suspended end-inspiratory volume and the entire lung was scanned from the apex to the bottom 12 to reduce discrepancies in the image acquisition parameters attributable to the different ct scanners we resampled all voxels at 10  10  10 mm3 before image analysis the multiplanar reconstruction mpr technique was performed to better observe images at the postprocessing station when necessaryall ct findings were described according to the fleischner society recommendations and defined as follows ggo appears as hazy increased opacity in the lung with the preservation of bronchial and vascular margins consolidation appears as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenuation that obscures the margins of vessels and airway walls a crazy-paving pattern appears as thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines superimposed on a background of ggo and a halo sign appears as ggo surrounding a nodule or mass 13 14 attention was paid to ct images with ggo consolidation ggo with consolidation a reticular pattern nodules rounded opacities cavitation a crazy-paving pattern an air bronchogram a halo sign bronchial wall thickening a subpleural curvilinear line and pulmonary fibrosis and the presence distribution and size of these ct characteristics were assessed in all subjects in addition the presence of thoracic lymphadenopathy lymph node size of greater than or equal to 10 mm in the short-axis dimension and pleural effusion or thickening were also recorded the distribution of each finding was classified as follows central predominantly in the inner two-thirds of the lung peripheral predominantly in the outer third of the lung and diffuse indications in multiple lung segments 15 calculation of the ct score a semiquantitative evaluation method was applied to quantify the extent of covid-19 according to previous studies 15 16 first the scope of the lesions in each lobe was estimated and a score of 0 none 1 affecting less than 5 of the lobe 2 affecting 525 of the lobe 3 affecting 2649 of the lobe 4 affecting 5075 of the lobe or 5 affecting more than 75 of the lobe was assigned second the ct score was obtained by adding up the scores of the five lobes for each patient the ct score was in the range of 0 to 25 all ct scans were independently reviewed and assessed by two chest radiologists zf and llc who had 18 years of experience in thoracic radiology respectively disagreements in reader interpretation were settled by consensus agreementall of the data were analyzed with statistical software spss statistical package version 190 ibm corporation continuous variables were expressed as means  standard deviations or median interquartile range iqr and categorical variables were presented as numbers percentages kolmogorov-smirnov tests were applied to check the normality of variables mann-whitney u tests were used for non-normally distributed data two-sample t tests were used for normally distributed data chi-square tests or fishers exact tests were applied to compare categorical variables spearmans correlation was performed to analyze the relationship between clinical variables age fever crp white blood cell count neutrophil count lymphocyte count platelet count hemoglobin level and procalcitonin level and ct variables maximum diameter of the lesion and ct

of the 62 patients in addition ggo with consolidation was observed in 22 355 patients rounded opacities were observed in 16 258 patients a crazy-paving pattern was observed in 16 258 patients an air bronchogram was observed in 14 226 patients a halo sign was observed in 7 113 patients a subpleural curvilinear line was observed in 6 97 patients pleural effusion was observed in 2 32 patients and consolidation nodules thoracic lymphadenopathy and pulmonary fibrosis were observed in 1 16 patient each no patient presented cavitation a reticular pattern or bronchial wall thickening between the early-stage group and progress-stage group there were no significant differences in the ct findings except for the halo sign p  0013 specifically the halo sign was found in only the early-stage group in 206 of the patientsin terms of lesion size lesions with a maximum diameter greater than 5 cm were found in 21 339 of 62 patients lesions with a maximum diameter of 349 cm were found in 22 355 patients lesions with a maximum diameter of 129 cm were found in 18 290 patients and lesions with a maximum diameter less than 1 cm were found in 1 16 patient there was no statistically significant difference in lesion size between the two groups of patients with covid-19 p  0059 regarding the distribution of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities lesions that were mainly distributed in both the central and peripheral lung regions accounted for 629 lesions distributed in the peripheral lung were present in 21 339 patients and lesions distributed in the central lung were present in 2 32 patients there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities between the two groups of patients with covid-19 p  0961the ct scores of all patients with covid-19 are shown in table 2 and the ct scores of each lobe in the two groups are shown in fig 6 the ct scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group p  0004 in the early-stage group 27 794 patients had ct scores in the range of 05 6 176 patients had ct scores of 610 and only 1 patient had a ct score of 11 or more in the progressive-stage group 10 357 patients had ct scores in the range of 05 12 429 patients had ct scores of 610 3 107 patients had ct scores of 1115 and 3 107 patients had ct scores of 15 or moreamong all 62 covid-19 patients the ct scores of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were significantly positively correlated with maximum diameter of the lesions r  0531 p  0001 and the ct scores were also significantly positively correlated with the age of the patients r  0255 p  0045 shown in table 3as reported patients with covid-19 usually develop clinical symptoms after an incubation period of 4170 days 11 after admission chest imaging examination was performed on them according to the results of changes in this disease in recent studies 10 11 the patients condition progressively worsens on the 35 days after symptom onset and the guidelines for an imaging diagnosis of covid-19 recommend that reviewing ct or plain radiograph is needed for suspected cases 35 days after diagnosis to observe changes in the disease status 12 thus we assigned patients to two groups according to the time of onset of symptoms to analyze the ct findings in early-stage and progressive-stage of covid-19 in this study 62 confirmed patients with covid-19 underwent chest ct scans and positive rate of detecting the pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities was 100 in addition the ct data in our study were obtained from the initial chest ct examination of patients who had not received any antiviral therapy these results may better reflect the degree of viral infection and the immune system status before clinical intervention and provide an important basis for clinical classification treatment strategy development and prognosis predictionin our study the major characteristic of covid-19 was ggo 613 followed by ggo with consolidation 355 rounded opacity 258 a crazy-paving pattern 258 and an air bronchogram 226 in contrast pulmonary fibrosis 16 and pleural effusions 32 were rare on chest ct images these various ct findings are likely related to the complex pathological changes in the lungs of patients with covid-19 although pathological changes in the lung tissue of covid-19 patients have not yet been studied recent studies have reported that sars-cov-2 is closely related with 88 identity to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sarslike coronaviruses with approximately 79 homology with sars-cov and approximately 50 homology with mers-cov 17 18 because the pathogenesis of viral infections in the same family may be similar previous studies on coronaviruses may be helpful in understanding the various ct findings in covid-19 patients based on similar pathological changes in sars patients pathological changes include injury to pulmonary epithelial cells hyaline membrane formation on in the inner wall of the alveoli and a large number of tissue cells and mass thrombi formed by proliferative fibrous tissue that block the small airway and air cavity 19 these pathological changes may be the main pathological basis of the ct findings especially the ggoamong all the ct findings ggo was the most common one in both the early and progressive stages of covid-19 and was characterized by multiple sized lesions mainly distributed in the peripheral lung 968 an analysis of thin-section ct images of sars patients showed that multiple ggos were the main imaging finding 684 and were distributed in the periphery of the lung 718 with interlobular septal thickening 242 and intralobular interstitial hyperplasia 322 also called the crazy-paving pattern these findings are very similar to the ct manifestations of covid-19 20 for pneumonia caused by mers-cov ggo was also found on the chest ct images and was mainly distributed in the subpleural and basilar lung regions 21 22 interestingly pleural effusion was rare and no tree-in-bud pattern or cavitation was found in pneumonia patients infected by the three kinds of coronaviruses in addition we found that only one case of covid-19 16 presented as consolidation without ggo compared with the large amount of consolidation that appears in the early stage of sars we speculate that the pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 may be less than that of sars-cov 23 thus it is necessary to fully understand and discriminate the ct features of covid-19 at an early stage which is helpful for the timely isolation and respiratory care of patients and early implementation of infection prevention measuresin addition to ggo another important ct characteristic of covid-19 was multiple ggos with consolidations accompanied by interlobular septal thickening mainly in the peripheral part of the lung these basic ct features were similar to the findings reported by huang et al whose study showed that multiple ggos with partial consolidation appeared bilaterally on the chest ct images of covid-19 patients 7 similarly in another chest ct study of a 33-year-old patient diagnosed with covid-19 in wuhan china multiple ggos distributed in both the peripheral lungs were found 5 therefore we suggest that multiple ggos with consolidations mainly in the periphery of the lung are a basic ct feature of covid-19 which is helpful for the initial screening of covid-19unexpectedly the halo sign 206 was the only significantly different ct manifestation in the early stage of covid-19 among all the ct findings in our study the halo sign appeared in only the early stage of covid-19 we hypothesized that the halo sign rapidly changed into ggo within 1 week due to the aggravation of covid-19 and no other new halo sign had been formed in the short term in addition there were no significant differences in the other ct findings or distribution of lesions between the two stages for these findings we speculated that the speed of ggo formation was due to the damage to the alveolar epithelium caused by the virus and may be similar to that of consolidation caused by an inflammatory reaction of the lung tissue resulting in a change in different types of lesions during the synchronous increase in opacification in pneumonia caused by sars-cov ooi et al found that ggo and consolidation formed in the first week of sars-cov infection increased in the second week and only residual strips and reticular shadows were seen in the fourth week 15 therefore the ct manifestations of covid-19 are different at different stages which helps the differential diagnosis of covid-19furthermore our results showed that the ct scores in the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those in the early-stage group further analysis showed that the ct scores were positively correlated with the maximum diameters of the lesions r  0531 indicating that the range of lesions in the progressive stage was larger than and the degree of inflammation was more serious than that in the early stage these results also showed that without any antiviral treatment covid-19 continued to progress 57 days after the onset of symptoms without any improvement trend therefore necessary clinical measures including antiviral and supportive therapies should be administered to prevent disease deterioration because of the lack of additional data the correlation between the ct score and clinical classification and the prognosis of covid-19 needs further study moreover ct scores showed a significant positive correlation with ages in all 62 patients r  0255 in a previous study on sars grinblat et al considered that age was a risk factor for severe lung injury and poor prognosis of sars 24 therefore elderly patients need to be treated earlier and more actively than younger patientsour study had several limitations first because covid-19 is a novel disease and lacks a series and long-term ct data we can analyze only the existing information in a retrospective analysis moreover the time of chest ct examination after symptom onset was inconsistent so it was difficult to summarize the ct appearances that could reflect the whole course of the disease second the sample size in our study was relatively small and there may be deviation in the comparison of the results of ct findings third most of our cases were imported cases and some were secondary cases further research is needed to observe whether virus variation exists in the process of infection and whether virus variation will produce different in ct manifestations finally there was no histopathological evidence from deceased patientsin conclusion our study showed that chest ct examination was very effective in detecting pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities in the natural course of covid-19 multiple ggos with consolidations in the peripheral lung was the primary ct characteristic of covid-19 the halo sign may be a special ct feature in the early stage of covid-19 while a significantly increased ct score may indicate the aggravation of covid-19 in the progressive stage in patients with dyspnea and respiratory distress ct examination is very effective in the preclinical screening of patients with covid-19severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2-infected pneumonia has been initially identified in wuhan china since december 20191 a total number of 693224 laboratory-confirmed cases have been documented globally as of march 30th 2020 including 33106 deaths2 after experiencing the largest outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome mers outside the arabian peninsula in 20153 the korean government has maintained a strong quarantine system for emerging infectious diseases imported from foreign countries the first novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 case in korea was a traveler from wuhan china in january 19th 20204 while the spread of covid-19 was limited before february 2056 a huge outbreak occurred among a religious group in the southern part of korea daegu and the number of covid-19 cases in korea reached 6593 on march 6th 202078while clinical and epidemiological features of covid-19 have been described in china by several investigations91011121314 most of them focused on sars-cov-2-infected pneumonia in china there is still uncertainty about the clinical course and outcomes of covid-19 especially outside of china where patients can be detected in the early course of disease by the quarantine system recently the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc reported epidemiological features of the earliest 28 covid-19 cases in republic of korea15 we performed this study to describe the clinical characteristics of covid-19 in republic of korea including

consensus by four physicians who were unaware of the clinical conditions of the patients each lung was divided into the upper middle and lower zone and infiltrations on each zone were scored from 0 to 4 with a total range of 0 to 24the institutional review board irb at seoul national university hospital reviewed and approved the study protocol irb registration no h-2002-042-1100 after that the irb at each participating hospital approved it the board waived the requirement for written consentthe study population included 28 hospitalized patients with confirmed covid-19 the median age of the 28 patients was 40 years interquartile range 2854 range 2073 and 15 536 were men of the 28 patients five 179 had one or more coexisting medical condition and diabetes was most common table 1 the most common symptoms at the time of admission for isolation were cough 8 286 and sore throat 8 286 followed by fever myalgia and headache 7 250 diarrhea was present in three patients 107 among initial symptoms two cases were asymptomatic when they were confirmed as covid-19during the hospitalization six patients 214 required oxygen supplement therapy four with nasal cannula and two with face mask no one required mechanical ventilator or ecmo therapy nineteen patients 679 received lopinavirritonavir for antiviral therapy ultimately pneumonia was present in 22 patients 785 and the proportion of pneumonia was 913 2123 among the patients who received a ct scan table 2 seventeen patients 607 developed fever and became afebrile during the hospitalization and the median day of defervescence was 9 days range 318 after symptom onset supplementary fig 1 by february 17 10 patients were off isolation or discharged and the median day of off-isolationdischarge was 185 days after symptom onset range 1127except for 2 patients who showed no symptoms six among 26 patients showed clinical deterioration during the hospitalization and needed supplemental oxygen therapy supplementary fig 2 the others showed little limitation in daily activity during the hospitalizationwhile neutrophilia or neutropenia was not common regardless of clinical severity fig 1a and b lymphopenia defined as  10  109l was more common in severe cases 333 26 than mild cases 182 422 during the clinical course fig 1c and d high levels of c-reactive protein in the blood were more frequently observed in severe cases fig 1e and f as the clinical course became worse during the 57 day period after symptom onsetwe could evaluate viral kinetics by serial rt-pcr of respiratory specimens from 9 patients from the early course of illness viral shedding from upper respiratory tract urt and lower respiratory tract lrt was shown in fig 2a and b as cycle threshold ct value respectively supplementary table 1 viral shedding was high during the first 5 days of illness and higher in urt than lrt it decreased after day 7 of illnessinfiltration on initial chest x-ray was observed in 13 patients 464 but pneumonia was confirmed in most patients who underwent computed tomography ct scan initially 1618 889 table 1 the chest radiographic scores remained relatively stable during the first week of illness however around day 7 of illness the scores began to increase in some patients suggesting progression of pneumonia fig 2cwe report the clinical course and outcomes of the first 28 patients with covid-19 in republic of korea the clinical severity was mild symptomatic or asymptomatic in 786 2228 of the patients the most common prodromal symptoms were sore throat cough fever and myalgia which was suggestive of common cold although radiological pneumonia was detected in the majority 2228 786 of the patients only 273 622 of them required supplemental oxygen therapy radiological pneumonia was detected as early as from the 1st day of illness onset and was even identified in patients who did not have any symptoms of the lrt infection such as cough sputum chest pain or dyspnea although they had radiological pneumonia they did not feel unwell and were able to carry on their daily activities as usual walking pneumonia the titers of sars-cov-2 shedding from the urt were very high from the prodromal phase of illness until day 5 of illnessin our patient cohort the clinical features of covid-19 during the prodromal phase were insidious and mild fever was absent in 750 of the patients at the time of admission throat symptoms such as pain discomfort and globus sensation and cough were ranked as relatively common but only 13 had these symptoms as the prodromal symptoms were mild and did not begin abruptly most of the patients were not able to tell exactly when they had become ill and because of this benign nature of the prodromal symptoms they did not realize that they had been infected with sars-cov-2 and went out to carry on usual activities while spreading the virus inadvertentlythe defining clinical characteristic of covid-19 was an early development of radiological pneumonia during the prodromal phase only 13 of our patients developed any clinical features suggesting pneumonia such as cough sputum or chest discomfort chest radiographs on hospitalization did not reveal any infiltrates in more than 50 of patients however chest ct scans which were performed on hospitalization or within 12 days showed infiltrates in the lungs suggesting viral pneumonia in 1618 889 patients table 1 if we had not taken ct scans of the lungs we would have easily missed the pneumonia diagnosis4 the radiological pneumonia from ct scan was detected as early as day 1 of illness onset the most common findings of ct scans were bilateral ground-glass opacity in the periphery of the lungs as described in previous studies91112 despite radiological pneumonia the patients were clinically stable and mobile during the first week of illness walking pneumonia we assessed the progression of covid-19 pneumonia using the chest radiograph scoring and it remained stable during the first week of illness but increased around the day 7 of illness this pattern of pneumonia progression was also noted in patients with mers-cov infection18 the early onset of the lung infiltrates and few clinical manifestations of lrt infection may suggest that the virus can invade into the lrt evading innate immune mechanisms and replicate before adaptive immune response begins to play a role a tissue biopsy and immunohistopathological studies of the lungs may elucidate this unique and interesting clinical feature of sars-cov-2 infectiongastrointestinal manifestations were relatively uncommon in our patient cohort while 10 of the patients had diarrhea 3 had vomiting and 3 had abdominal pain at presentation all of them revealed other common symptoms of acute respiratory illness overall diarrhea was present in 39 1128 of patients during hospitalization from the admission in this study as diarrhea is an adverse effect of lopinavirritonavir we reassessed the frequency of diarrhea according to the patients being treated with lopinavirritonavir or not and 53 1019 and 11 19 of our patients had diarrhea respectively data not shown in chinese patients the frequency of diarrhea ranged 21091112 it is important to note that receptor binding is a major determinant of tissue tropism for a coronavirus19 a recent study showed that sars-cov-2 used angiotensin converting enzyme ii as a cellular entry receptor2021 as sars-cov19 therefore it is plausible that sars-cov-2 may be able to replicate in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells and be excreted in the stool recently china cdc reported that they isolated sars-cov-2 from a stool sample taken 15 days after illness onset of a laboratory confirmed patient22 the possibilities of fecal-to-oral transmission and opportunistic aerosol transmission of sars-cov-2 remain to be determined23it is important to note that the virus titers in the respiratory specimens peaked on early days after illness onset fig 2a and b of the seven infectors of our cohort two transmitted the virus on the first day of illness one on the 8th day of illness and 4 via household transmission the ct values of the urt specimens ranged from 1825 in the 4 infectors within the 5 days of illness 1874 1833 2512 and 215 for each patient our data suggest that the viral shedding from the urt may reach its peak during the first 3-5 days after illness onset a recent study on virus shedding kinetics is also in line with our finding24 this shift to the left pattern of virus shedding kinetics is strikingly different from that of sars-cov which shows an inverted v pattern with its peak at day 10 of illness25 also of note is that 571 47 of infectors had cough or sputum in contrast to only 238 521 of non-infectors having cough these findings suggest that the transmissions of sars-cov-2 may occur easily and begin from the prodromal phase of illness just like common cold or influenza viruses considering that the median time from symptom onset to isolation of the patients was 3 days and that high titers of virus shedding began from day 1 of illness with the peak around day 35 of illness early detection and isolation strategy may be relatively less effective in containing the virus in covid-19the clinical outcomes of most patients in this study were not complicated as of 17 february 2020 no patient required supplemental oxygen therapy with mechanical ventilation nor any organ-supporting treatments in intensive care unit a total of 10 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital of the 18 confirmed cases who are still in hospital most are stable or improvingthere are some limitations in our study only 28 patients from our cohort were included in this study however we gathered and analyzed the detailed clinical information about all of the first 28 cases nationwide in republic of korea moreover some cases were confirmed during the surveillance test for covid-19 after exposure to sars-cov-2 the proportion of elderly patients and frequency of underlying conditions were small and therefore the first 28 patients from the early phase of the covid-19 outbreak in korea had relatively favorable outcomes26 most of the enrolled patients would be healthier than the population of recent larger outbreaks showing worse outcomes mostly in the elderly group the results regarding outcomes in this study should be interpreted cautiously in most cases we did not perform virologic tests for coinfection of other respiratory viruses such as influenzaour study suggests that 1 the prodromal symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection were mild 2 radiological pneumonia was very common and developed from the early days of illness 3 pneumonia may progress at day 7 of illness 4 high titers of the virus shed from the urt during the prodromal phase 5 and the median time from symptom onset to defervescence was 10 days and to off-isolation 185 dayscoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a severe public health emergency worldwide caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 1 the number of confirmed cases and the mortality rate are increasing worldwide and the world health organization who acknowledged covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 2 currently there have been many efforts to diagnose a number of patients with symptoms or close contacts to prevent the spread in the community this may prevent some spreading of the virus but not perfectly moreover many confirmed cases are occurring through diagnosis but there is no definite guideline for the initial therapeutic approach for them and therefore many patients have been dying if the covid-19 symptoms are severe the patients are hospitalized and the treatment is done though they have not been established yet currently however no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter among them there will be also some cases in whom severe lung injury or cytokine storm has progressed 3 leading to sudden death case fatality rates in some countries especially italy and spain are high and effective therapeutic measures are urgently needed 4 in this review we discuss some important points dedicated to the management of patients with covid-19 which should help reducing morbidity and mortalitypatients with covid-19 have higher leukocyte numbers c-reactive protein crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr d-dimer and an imbalance of proand anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines with increased levels of interleukin il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 il-10 basic fibroblast growth factor fgf2 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf interferon ifn- ifn- induced protein ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip1- mip1- platelet derived growth factor pdgf-b tumor necrosis factor tnf- and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf-a 5 higher expression levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-csf ip-10 mcp-1 mip1- and tnf- were found in individuals admitted to the intensive care unit icu 5 these cytokines may indicate patients at risk to develop acute lung injury followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and eventually death this circumstance is called cytokine release syndrome crs or cytokine storm 6the main pathogenesis of covid-19 may be similar to that of other viruses such as influenza or others however there have been few efforts to make a potential hypothesis why covid-19 could cause a higher incidence of acute lung injury ards cytokine storm and death than other viruses we are going to make a simple hypothetical model for the inflammatory processes and cytokine storm for covid-19 to understand the pathophysiology of covid-19 and its associated lung injury ards and cytokine stormfirst covid-19 sars-cov-2 is first attached to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors in the nasopharynx and respiratory epithelium 7second host immune responses are initiated after entry of covid-19 into the cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 are formed by various kinds of immune cells such as t cells b-cells and macrophages and others 89third the degree of increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines determines the degree of covid-19-induced lung injury the more increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines the higher the injury to lung tissue and the more severe the ards which could be related to higher mortalityfourth the degree of increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 is higher as induced by other viruses especially this effect is more pronounced in older age and comorbid conditionsfifth the reason why this effect is less pronounced in younger age groups may be obscure but it could be due to the immaturity of immune system and the predominance of th2 immunity than th1 in these groupssixth the reason why this effect is more pronounced in older age groups and those with comorbid conditions may be obscure but it could be due to pre-existing subclinical or subtle inflammations represented by increased high-sensitive crp hscrp in these groupsseventh the exaggerated increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in covid-19 could be due to hyperactivation of various kinds of immune cells in response to n-protein of covid-19 which is called cytokine stormeighth this increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 cytokine storm can cause acute lung injury ards and eventually multiorgan failureninth cytokine storm may start from the early course of disease to later stage according to the degree of activation of host immune response and it may be rapidly progressive at any timetenth there may be clinico-pathologic non-correlations between them 3 the patient may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms despite severely progressed conditions which will delay the appropriate treatment at an early stage
the pathogenesis of covid-19 is summarized in fig 1
 regarding our immunity there are 3 states 1 immunosuppressive state 2 normal immune state this is also classified as lower normal normal and upper normal and 3 hyperimmune state if there are 100 normal persons they are distributed from 0 to 100 on a scale according to the degree of anti-viral immunity which will be mostly represented by th1 response if the person is immunocompromised heshe will have minus points on the scale the lower the minus number is located the more severe the immunosuppressive condition will be if the number is higher than 100 the person will get hyperactivated host immune response and will have lung injury ards and multiorgan failureif the person is infected with other usual respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus or influenza heshe will have fever and sore throat caused by host immune response however the degree of increase in inflammatory reaction will be 35 so if the person who has the number of immunity scale of 90 and infected by other viruses the number on a scale will increase to 9395 however the degree of increase in inflammatory reaction in patients with the current covid-19 will be 1015 therefore if the person who has the number of immunity scale 90 is infected by covid-19 the number on a scale will increase to 100105 which means that there will be a high probability that this patient will progress to cytokine storm due to hyperactivated immune response which might lead to deathbecause younger age groups immune system may be immature and they may have the predominance of th2 immunity than th1 10 they might have the number of immunity scale 030 therefore even though they are infected by covid-19 and the number is increased by 10-15 by covid-19 their number will be located between 10 and 45 therefore there is a lower possibility that they will be progress to severe cytokine storm which may explain less mortality in this grouphowever the person in an older age group will have multiple co-morbidities by aging process such as atherosclerosis hypertension diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease and they might have pre-existing subclinical or subtle inflammations represented by increased hscrp in these groups 11 therefore they might have a number of immunity scale 8595 therefore if they are infected by covid-19 and the number of 1015 is increased by covid-19 their number will be located between 95 and 110 therefore there is high possibility that they will progress to severe cytokine storm which may explain high mortality in this group surely there will be additional factors that influence the susceptibility and severity of covid-19 such as genetic variant of different polymorphisms or environmental factors as smokingin addition to this basic 1015 increase in the degree of inflammatory reaction if the patient progressed to cytokine storm the number will rapidly increase to 200300 we are going to discuss the use of steroids later but the basic increase of 1015 in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 might be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but steroids may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure to suppress cytokine storm because 200300 cannot be suppressed even though high dose of steroids are used recently hydroxychloroquine has been shown to be effective in covid-19 12 and this drug may reduce the increase in the degree of inflammatory reaction however we do not know which agent may be better in decreasing inflammatory reactions and how much the number might be decreased by steroids or hydroxychloroquinein addition to these the rate of bacterial complications will increase in accordance with the progression with time after covid-19 we think if bacterial complication is combined with cytokine storm there will be more severe inflammatory reactions although this theory may not be perfect this may be helpful to understand the pathogenesis and potential harms of covid-19 and guide how patients should be treatedevidence based medicine ebm is the conscientious explicit judicious and reasonable use of modern best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients 13 ebm integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available research information 13 many clinicians are applying the treatment to the current coronavirus covid-19 based on the previous experiences for mers or sars however this is not exactly evidence-based since covid-19 is different to be evidence-based a large-scale randomized placebo-controlled trial for covid-19 should urgently be conducted however it is too difficult to find an appropriate drug for covid-19 in a pandemic state because it will take a long time although this effort should also be done concurrentlyin addition even if the results of small rcts are meaningful those are often reversed when a larger rct is performed 14 moreover although the results of meta-analysis may be considered to be the best evidence this should be interpreted with caution because the meta-analysis results can be significant even though all the results of individual rcts have no statistical significance 15 furthermore it has been claimed that most published research findings are false and not useful 1617 though this should also be interpreted with caution and numerously published meta-analyses are also misleading 18 in addition guidelines suggested by experts can also have a mistake 19 in this context we should find what is the best strategies to protect the humans form the harms of covid-19 even though we apply several therapeutic strategies investigated in sars or mers it should be interpreted with caution if we cannot apply ebm immediately in this covid-19 pandemic we should also make every effort to find wise ways to solve the problems in this situation an experience-based approach may be also important in this pandemic era and many publications should urgently be published even though they are case reports or case seriescovid-19 is causing a severe public health emergency all over the word and the mortality is rapidly increasing all over the world we would like to remind of the basic principle for the treatment of patients but we often forget this do no harm 20 we should think of what harms means and what do no harms would look like in this pandemic we have thought and summarized the potential harms and the things we are doing now regarding covid-19 and it is summarized as below and table 1
1continuing smoking is a significant harm to respiratory epitheliums if so why dont we recommend cessation of smoking at this time not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients2cytokine storm is considered to be a significant harm and an important cause of death if so why dont we make every effort to prevent this process at an early course of disease not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients3currently some asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms have severe radiologic findings and bacterial complications which can lead to sudden death but no radiologic examinations and treatment are done for these patients until severe symptoms develop this may be considered to be a significant harm if so why dont we make every effort to detect these patients and treat them at an early course of disease not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients4currently covid-19 infected patients are divided into two groups one is the person who is isolated at home but no medications are provided and the other is the person who developed severe symptoms with time and admitted to the hospital currently many patients with covid-19 are recommended to be at home until severe symptoms develop due to infectivity to others we think there will be a patient group with moderate symptoms in whom if early treatment is done with steroids and antibiotics they will not progress to severe conditions to let them at home will be a significant harm if so why dont we provide medications such as steroids or antibiotics at the time of covid-19 test and monitor the patient even by phone considering it is practically difficult for the patient to visit the clinic again if so policy should be changed in this pandemic era as medications should be given to the patients more liberally than in usual situations not doing so is causing a significant harm to the patients and hesitating for the use of steroids and antibiotics may be a harm to the patients with covid-195doing something is better than nothing currently there are no established guidelines for covid-19 and we rely on the previous treatments for sars mers or influenza or on expert opinions recently some investigators are discussing the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 but this is just based on in vitro studies and not much experience but why dont we have more interests on the use of elderberry supplements which was shown to be effective in cold and influenza by randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study and meta-analysis 21 22 23 if some treatments such as elderberry supplements or betadine mouth or nasal spray are not causing significant harms we think doing something is better than nothing6misinterpretation of the various studies including systematic review without considering the biases will lead to a false guidance for the treatment of covid-19 which will be a significant harm 24 the role of experts who are doing evidence-based medicine or meta-research is very important to reduce the harm to the patients in this pandemic era see table 2

in addition to these there may be more current harms in this pandemic era and this should also be urgently discussedfirst smoking cessation should be encouraged this has always been recommended for general population but it has also been very difficult for the people to do so because covid-19 can predominantly damage the respiratory epitheliums and lungs this should at least be recommended recently it was also hypothesized that those individuals who have been exposed to nicotine prior to their exposure to the virus are primed to be at higher risk because nicotine can directly impact the putative receptor for the virus ace2 and lead to deleterious signaling in lung epithelial cells 25 in addition several cytokines including il-2 il-6 and tnf- which is induced by smoking might trigger cytokine storm in covid-19 we still do not know whether a short duration of smoking cessation could reduce the susceptibility or severity of covid-19 or not but if it is beneficial doing something smoking cessation is better than nothingsecond povidoneiodine polyvinylpyrrolidoneiodine pvp-i betadine mouth or nasal spray can be applied to kill the covid-19 viruses and it will reduce the number of covid-19 viruses which enter into the cells covid-19 is initiated by the attachment of the virus to the pharynx or respiratory epithelium and this causes sore throat currently however we do not know about whether the number of virus attached to the pharynx or respiratory epithelium will influence on the severity of covid-19 easily speaking when you inhaled 10 viruses and when you inhaled 1000 viruses will infection risk or the disease severity be same or different currently this cannot be proved easily however considering the effectiveness of a mask that prevents respiratory infections less exposure is likely to prevent infection by an indirect evidence one previous meta-analysis showed that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of sars wearing masks odds ratio 032 95 ci 025 to 040 number needed to treat nnt  6 454 to 803 vs wearing n95 masks 009 003 to 030 nnt  3 237 to 406 26 we can make a potential hypothesis if 10 viruses were inhaled and attached to the throat this may be cleared by host immunity however if 1000 viruses were inhaled and attached to the throat it should go through a fight between the virus and host immunity if viruses are cleared by host immunity the person can be free from virus but if the viruses win they may replicate exponentially within a relatively short time and will cause viremia in the blood in this situation we still do not know whether the degree of viremia viral load might be correlated to the degree of host hyperimmune response or whether reduction of viruses in the throat for example using betadine mouth spray or gargles could decrease the degree of viremia in bloodcurrently inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and blocking angiotensin receptor 2 ar2 is considered to be the key target for sars-cov-2 vaccination and covid-19 therapy 27 due to this finding some authors recommend the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei or angiotensin receptor 2 blockers arbs 28 currently these findings and suggestions cant be transferred into clinical practice easily acei and arbs are widely used in clinical daily practice no clinical studies have been made in the set of covid-19 outbreak so far even basic science due to the pathophysiological mechanisms eg effectiveness of blocking ar2 are limited 27 due to a substantiated benefit-risk evaluation a therapy with arbs or acei cannot be recommended in addition we do not know about how many ace2 receptors could be downregulated or blocked by antibodies or vaccines and how many entries of viruses could be inhibited by these if they are developed however if blocking entry of virus is a potential therapeutic target we think that direct killing of the virus in the throat by betadine mouth or nasal spray might be more efficacious than the receptor downregulationseveral studies showed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov could be inactivated by pvp-i in vitro 2930 one phase 1 study shows application of pvp-i nasal spray to the nasal mucosa did not result in any demonstrable limitation of the nasal function nor in detectable damage to the multilayer ciliated epithelium of the nose 31 because anyone can buy betadine mouth or nasal spray or gargles without a prescription as over-the-counter medicines if it does not cause any significant harm there is no reason not to use it and it can be applied if a person feels sore throat at an early course of the disease although side effects of pvp-i use are rare the adverse effect of iodine and other precautions should also be recognized pvp-i can cause allergic reactions and should not be used in patients suffering from thyroid diseases 32 even there exist no studies for pvp-i and sars-cov-2 either due to the benefit-risk evaluation pvp-i can be used in patients infected with sars-cov-2 with no or mild symptoms without allergies to pvp-i or thyroid diseases or if a person is visiting more crowded places such as airport it can also be applied easilythird the use of elderberry supplements should be considered at an early course of the disease although it has not been tested in coronavirus elderberry supplements which was shown to be effective in cold and influenza by randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study and meta-analysis 21 22 23 currently there was one cleveland clinic news reported by emily bamforth on the use of elderberry supplements 33 although there have been several reports on the beneficial effect of elderberry supplements on several viral infections 21 22 23 there have been few hypotheses on the potential immunologic mechanisms on the beneficial effect of elderberry supplements focusing on covid-19it is well known that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a receptor for sars-cov 34 a recent study showed that sars-cov-2 covid-19 spike s glycoproteins also uses ace2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov-2 s and sars-cov s bind with similar affinities to human ace2 correlating with the efficient spread of sars-cov-2 among humans 35 although less discussed than ace2 it was shown that cd209l l-sign encoded by clec4m is also a receptor for sars-cov 36 in this study cd209l was expressed in human lung in type ii alveolar cells and endothelial cells both potential targets for sars-cov and the large s glycoprotein of sars-cov might use both ace2 and cd209l in virus infection and pathogenesis 36 in addition chan et al demonstrated that individuals homozygous for clec4m tandem repeats are less susceptible to sars infection and l-sign is expressed in both non-sars and sars-cov-infected lung 37 they also showed that compared with cells heterozygous for l-sign cells homozygous for l-sign show higher binding capacity for sars-cov higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection suggesting that homozygosity for l-sign plays a protective role during sars infection 37 in summary the first encounter of the virus with the host might be through binding to attachment receptors such as these receptors which might play an important role of infection for a large number of enveloped viruses by capturing concentrating and transmitting infectious virions 38 once a virus reaches its target cell a cascade of events generally starting with the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with specific entry receptors and co-receptors is necessary in order to trigger the virus-cell membrane fusion 38although not much studied in coronavirus capture and transmission of hiv-1 by the c-type lectin l-sign was inhibited by carbohydrate-binding agents cbas 39 in this study both mannose- and n-acetylglucosamine glcnac-specific cbas dose-dependently prevented virus capture by l-sign-expressing 293 t-rexl-sign cells 39 because coronavirus also uses l-sign as a receptor for entry one study suggested that influenza virus and coronavirus infections might also qualify to be treated by cbas 40keyaerts et al evaluated the effect of 33 plant lectins with different specificities to coronavirus 41 they showed that the plant lectins possessed marked antiviral properties against both coronaviruses with ec50 values in the lower microgramml range middle nanomolar range being non-toxic cc50 at 50100 microgml and the strongest anti-coronavirus activity was found predominantly among the mannose-binding lectins in addition a number of galactose- n-acetylgalactosamine- glucose- and n-acetylglucosamine-specific plant agglutinines exhibited anti-coronaviral activity 41 they also found that there was a significant correlation with an r-value of 070 between the ec50 values of the 10 mannose-specific plant lectins effective against the two coronaviruses but little correlation was seen between the activity of other types of lectins 41 therefore they reported that two targets of possible antiviral intervention were identified in the replication cycle of sars-cov the first target is located early in the replication cycle most probably viral attachment and the second target is located at the end of the infectious virus cycle 41de clercq summarized various compounds which have been reported to exhibit in vitro activity against sars-cov though they have an ill-defined mode of action but selectivity indexes up to 100 valinomycin glycopeptide antibiotics plant lectins hesperetin glycyrrhizin aurintricarboxylic acid chloroquine niclosamide nelfinavir and calpain inhibitors among them plant lectins and chloroquine which is being discussed for the potential treatment of covid-19 are included 42this hypothesis has further been tested later in mers-cov epidemic because coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with the spike proteins present on their surface responsible for virus entry into the target cell 43 because mers-cov also cause a high mortality rate of about 35 no vaccine is available and therapeutic options for mers-cov infections are limited to palliative and supportive care a search for specific antiviral treatments was urgently needed 43 millet et al thought that lectins are attractive anti-coronavirus candidates because of the highly glycosylated nature of the spike protein and tested the antiviral effect of griffithsin grft a lectin isolated from the red marine alga griffithsia sp against mers-cov infection 43 they demonstrated that griffithsin is a potent inhibitor of mers-cov infection without significant cytotoxicity 43 griffithsin inhibited entry into host cells of particles pseudotyped with the mers-cov spike protein suggesting that griffithsin inhibits spike protein function during entry at the binding step 43the compounds found in elderberries are phenolic acids flavonoids vitamins lectins and aroma compounds etc 44 a very similar lectin called sambucus nigra fruit specific agglutinin i sna-if was identified as a minor protein in ripe elderberry fruits 45 although elderberry supplements have not been tested in the current covid-19 pandemic lectin components might inhibit spike protein function during entry at the binding step as mentioned above or have unknown other effectscurrently because anyone can buy elderberry supplements without a prescription as over-the-counter medicines if it does not cause any significant harm there is no reason not to use it and it can be applied at an early course of the disease although there have been some reports on the increase in some cytokines by elderberry supplements 46 elderberry supplements also have various kinds of other effects surely however we should also weigh the benefit and risk for the use of elderberry supplements like other otcs we know that even otcs eg tylenol have many adverse effects on the drug information in addition we should also look at the evidence-based systematic review of elderberry and elderflower sambucus nigra by the natural standard research collaboration 47 which could be applied to the current covid-19 pandemicin this point we should be able to guide the use of these elderberry supplements to the general population or patients with covid-19 as this elderberry supplements can be used in those with covid-19 at an early course of disease if you understand the previous efficacy of these and potential adverse effectsfourth the use of oral steroids should be actively considered at an early course of the disease if the cause of death of covid-19 is ards and organ failure due to cytokine storm by hyperactivated host immune response why we are not considering to suppress or prevent this process at an early course of the disease we think the increase in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 may be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but it may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure this situation can be assimilated by forest fire if a first small fire by cigarette butts can be detected by hiker early early covid-19 it can be extinguished by small amounts of water low dose steroids easily but if wild forest fires spread persistent high fever dyspnea in the mountain without early suppression it cannot be suppressed despite every effort by numerous fire trucks long-term use of very high dose of steroids and all mountains will be burned destructed lung requiring ecmo there was one recent systematic review reporting that the use of steroids may be harmful to patients with covid-19 48 however this result should be interpreted with caution because the quality of the included studies is extremely low and they have many biases many studies are missing and the included studies are not on the use of steroids vs no use this result should not be generalized to the patients with early course of the disease and mild symptomsone study investigated the structural arrangement of n protein explaining the first steps of its interaction with nucleic acid at the initial stages of virus structure assembly 49 the nucleocapsid n protein of covid-19 has nearly 90 amino acid sequence identity with sars-cov and the n protein antibodies of sars-cov may cross react with covid-19 but may not provide cross-immunity in a similar fashion to sars-cov the n protein of covid-19 may play an important role in suppressing the rna interference rnai to overcome the host defense 50 in rat models the n-protein of sars-cov had pathogenicity and could induce obvious pulmonary inflammatory reaction and acute lung injury which were related to the increase and imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines 51 in this study glucocorticoids could effectively alleviate the pulmonary inflammatory reaction induced by n-protein of sars-cov supporting the beneficial role of steroids on the inflammatory reactions caused by n-protein of the current covid-19 51according to the chinese governments daily report 132213 of patients with covid-19 developed severe or fatal illness and therefore the chinas national health commission released the fifth trial version of diagnosis and treatment scheme for pneumonitis with covid-19 and provided a systematic treatment strategy for severe cases and systematic corticosteroids treatment methylprednisolone 12 mg per kg body weight for 35 days was recommended to be an adjuvant therapy 52 zou et al recently showed that systematic corticosteroids therapy in the first 35 days in severe patients could enhance oxygen saturation sao2 and arterial oxygen tension pao2inspiratory oxygen fraction fio2 but corticosteroids did not exert any intervention on survival of ncp patients complicated with both ards and shock or multiple organ injury 53 nevertheless they concluded that corticosteroids in the phase of ards would effectively inhibit furious inflammatory storm and gain valuable time for controlling infection and preventing secondary multiorgan damage and shock which implies that corticosteroids have synergistic biological effects when combined with other intensivists treatment against severe or fatal ncp patients 53 however as we mentioned above we think the increase in various pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by covid-19 may be suppressed by short-course low dose steroids in an early stage of disease but it may not be effective in a later stage of disease such as ards and multiorgan failure because a later stage may be a big fire which cannot be suppressed easilyone another thing is a short course of low dose oral steroids is easily prescribed in the treatment of urticaria but why are we afraid of prescribing the use of oral steroids in the acute covid-19 setting even though many patients progress to severe disease in whom there will be some patients with mild symptoms with severe radiologic findings if we can lower the percentage of progressing to cytokine storm by early use of steroids even though it is found to be statistically nonsignificant such as p-value of 006009 several patients will be rescued therefore we should interpret the results based on the p-value cautiously and conversely misinterpretation or misunderstanding of p-value will cause a significant harm to the patients with covid-19 recently some groups showed the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine 12 until these reports there was evidence of hydroxychloroquine on coronavirus just from in vitro study 5455 therefore the doctor who first used this drug in a patient with covid-19 might have done this treatment by non-evidence-based medicine we should try the oral steroids in patients with covid-19 at an early course of diseasefifth the use of oral antibiotics should be actively considered if the patient feels not good because secondary bacterial infection might aggravate acute immunological lung injury induced by several cytokines eg il-2 il-6 and tnf- in covid-19 there are no controlled clinical trials evaluating the use of empiric antimicrobials in covid-19 patients or other coronavirus driven diseases therefore recommendations can only be based on other viral diseases like influenza 56 furthermore another guideline on treating covid-19 patients was released both guidelines suggest that blind or inappropriate use of antibacterial drugs especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs should be avoided in patients with mild or no symptoms 57 however we are against these guidelines because the current covid-19 situation is definitely different to other usual viral infections because some patients with mild symptoms can have severe radiologic features and sudden death furthermore bacterial superinfection is hard to detect and cannot be easily diagnosed symptoms of covid-19 and bacterial superinfection may overlap data on the prevalence of bacterial superinfection in patients with covid-19 are very limited 58 influenza pneumonia is often associated with staphylococcus aureus co-infection and can be especially virulent 56 initiating empiric antibacterial therapy in adults with community-acquired pneumonia who test positive for influenza was recommended by recent clinical practice guidelines 56 therefore we suggest that according to the clinical manifestations of patients if the accompanying bacterial infection cannot be ruled out patients can take antibacterial drugs against community-acquired pneumonia such as amoxicillin azithromycin or fluoroquinolones 57 empirical antibacterial treatment in severe patients should cover all possible pathogens deescalating therapy until the pathogenic bacteria are clarified 59in addition the current special situation should also be considered currently if the patient is diagnosed as having covid-19 heshe will be isolated at home and is recommended that if severe symptoms are developed come to the hospital and no medications are provided however we think this is a very dangerous situation because some persons might have no or only mild symptoms despite severe progression of lung injury and when these patients become to feel dyspnea and come to the hospital the time might be late for the recovery they will receive not only intravenous antibiotics but also various kinds of multiple drugs we speculate that many patients who became to get severe symptoms might have bacterial complications it has been reported that bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40 of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization 60 the incidence of bacterial complications of covid-19 is unknown yet but considering that more patients with covid-19 get severe symptoms than observed in other respiratory viral diseases we speculate that more bacterial complications might be combined not only in severe conditions but also in mild conditions if the patient is having usual other respiratory viral infections heshe will visit the clinic and will be prescribed antibiotics however in the current situation the patient with covid-19 cannot visit an usual clinic and should wait until he will recover or get dyspnea if virus damages the throat or lungs other bacteria oral cavity can cause secondary infection and this cannot be exactly evaluated and diagnosed because the laboratory examinations for bacteria such as culture or procalcitonin may not be exact due to false negative and all the bacteria cannot be examinedin this situation based on the medical principle do no harm waiting until the patient deteriorate is a severe harm therefore to prevent the deterioration of the patient with covid-19 oral antibiotics and oral steroids should be given to the patient at the time of covid-19 and it should be recommended if the patient has high fever and feels bad take the antibiotics and steroids empirically and it can be acceptable in the pandemic era as many patients are dying due to complications of covid-19 if the doctor can monitor and guide the patients with phone calls it will be better if there are enough medical personnels so in the current situation liberal and early use of oral antibiotics and steroids may be do no harm which may be a different situation than during the usual common cold situation in our experiences if the patient feels bad earlier antibiotics and steroids are used the patients condition will recoversixth hydroxychloroquine can be used as a secondary drug in patients with worsening symptoms in covid-19 chloroquine and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial agents that have demonstrated antiviral effects on sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro 5455 chloroquine had inhibitory effects for multiple rna viruses in vitro chloroquine showed no antiviral or clinical beneficial effects in treatment of dengue and chikungunya virus infections and as influenza prophylaxis 61 a news briefing suggested that its use in more than 100 patients showed that it was superior to the control in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus negative conversion and shortening the disease course but the data have not been published yet 62 a recent consensus document recommended chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily for minimum of 5 days 63 another study found hydroxychloroquine more potent than chloroquine in vitro based on these data hydroxychloroquine for 4 days 400 mg twice daily after a loading dose of 400 mg was recommended 54 a recent systematic review found no published studies in covid-19 patients 64 furthermore adding azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily treatment seemed to have a beneficial outcome in a small french cohort 12 however we should also be cautious in interpreting the results of hydroxychloroquine because the current situation is just based on the in vitro studies and small number of case series also the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine should also be considered in this situation we think hydroxychloroquine should not be used as a routine treatment of covid-19 but if the condition of the patients worsens despite the use of steroids and antibiotics hydroxychloroquine can be used as a secondary drugseventh policy for the drug use should be changed to reduce the mortality of patients in usual situation the patient can visit the clinic frequently according to the condition therefore steroids and antibiotics can be given timely based on the judgement of doctors however this pattern of examination diagnosis and treatment cannot be done in this covid-19 era doctors prescriptions are surely important to diagnose and treat patients however as we mentioned above patients are just waiting for recovery or deterioration until severe symptoms and no treatment is done in the meanwhile if the patient is infected occur with covid-19 and gets fever and visit the different clinics the treatment will not be standardized among doctors if a doctor concerns for the fever and the nature of rapid deterioration in covid-19 he may use steroids and antibiotics early while other doctors may not if so we can make some guidelines for the practical use of antibiotics steroids and hydroxychloroquine for the patients to use these drugs these should also include the benefit and adverse effect for each drug the policy we are proposing is to give these drugs to the patients freely although the range of drug should also be more discussed in korea the diagnosis of covid-19 is being done by drive through our suggestion is to make another drive through place to give these drugs to the patients to avoid the dissemination of infection because if the infected patient go to the hospital for the treatment heshe can infect all other patients also it will be good if the drugs are given to the patient who is visiting the screening clinic for example at the time of drive through diagnosis and explain in detail the benefit and adverse effect for each drug and then the doctor can check the result for covid-19 and guides the patient for taking the drugs by phone calls also the patient can take these drugs at hisher judgement this concept is based on that 1 any treatment for covid-19 has not been established 2 even though the patient visits the doctor the treatment patterns will be all different among doctors 3 steroids have frequently been used in other mild diseases such as urticaria 4 because we do not exactly know the presence or absence of secondary infection when the patient get fever oral antibiotics for 34 days can be acceptable treatment in routine clinical practice further 5 hydroxychloroquine can also be given to the patients and it can be recommended that if the patients symptoms worsen despite the use of steroids and antibiotics heshe can take hydroxychloroquine after recognizing all the adverse effect of the drug but if the symptoms worsen the patient surely visit the hospital as wellcovid-19 is causing a severe public health emergency and the mortality is rapidly increasing all over the word in this era we suggested 7 recommendations to rescue the patients and to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to covid-19 based an immunological point of view table 2 ours may be personal opinions but we believe these may be beneficial to control these complications exerted by covid-19 in addition there will be more other or conflicting evidences and publications regarding our opinions however we would like to remind of the basic principle for the treatment of patients again but we often forget this do no harm we all should think deeply on what is harm and what is no harm in addition we would like to say again doing something is better than nothing in the acceptable level of clinical practice we hope that our opinions can be transferred to not only who and cdc but also clinicians researchers and many institutions and covid-19 could be finished as rapidly as possibleall authors made substantial

conflict of interests the opinions described in this manuscript are those from authors and do not represent the opinions of the journal or other companiesthe 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has been declared a world pandemic by who on 11 march 20201 clinical symptoms of 2019-ncov have mostly resembled that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov of 2003 both shared the same receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace22 therefore this virus was named sars-cov-2 by 28 march 2020 a total of 593 735 sars-cov-2 infected cases have been confirmed in 200 countries worldwide in addition to the respiratory system involvement recent evidence has shown that sars-cov-2 can affect other organ systems including nervous vascular digestive urinary haematological and so on3 4 the pathological findings confirmed the nature of multiorgan damaged by sars-cov-2 which include pulmonary lesion and cerebral oedema microvascular steatosis and thrombosis5 neurological symptoms can be trivial or non-specific at the early stage of the covid-19 infected patients which have often been delayed and misdiagnosed and led to inappropriate management these patients then become silent contagious sources or virus spreaders although neurological involvement is uncommon in patients with covid-19 it can be seen in those with severe infection and the patients may manifest as acute cerebrovascular diseases impaired consciousness or encephalopathy and skeletal muscle injury6
in order to help neurologists to understand the occurrence development and outcome of this disease and be familiar with its diagnosis and treatment process we present this consensus for prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 for neurologists in this consensus we summarised the current clinical guidelines and research progress on the management of covid-19 and emphasised on its neurological manifestations we hope that this consensus statement can help all recognise the infection early and protect the providers and healthcare environmentcovs are enveloped viruses with a single-strand positive-sense rna genome which are separated into four genera based on phylogeny alpha-cov group 1 beta-cov group 2 gamma-cov group 3 and delta-cov group 4 covs was first isolated from domestic animals in 1937 the first human coronavirus was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients in 1965 in humans covs infections primarily involve the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts under the electronic microscope there are many evenly arranged protrusions on the surface of viral particles the entire virus particle resembles a crown of a medieval european emperor hence it was given the name of coronavirus a coronavirus particle is usually enclosed by an envelope and its membrane surface has three proteins spike s envelope e and membrane m protein spike s projecting from the virus membrane and resembling a crown is the key structure for its infectivity and pathogenicity these spikes can recognise and bind to receptors on the surface of host cells and subsequently invade the host cells7
sars-cov-2 the -type novel coronavirus is one of the viruses that exists in the form of rna with a total of 29 000 nucleotide bases these bases preserve the genetic information for its reproduction genomic sequence analysis of sars-cov-2 has been published on virologicalorg nextstrainorg biorxiv and other academic journals in early february of 2020 chinese researchers shared the total sequences of this new type of virus so they can be used by other researches around the world sars-cov-2 virus sequence is highly homologous to that of bat coronavirus 962 similarity the entire bat coronavirus genomic sequence has 795 homology to sars coronavirus8
sars-cov-2 spike protein and hiv gp120 protein are both recognition proteins on the membrane surface but their pathogenic mechanisms are quite different the spike protein enables sars-cov-2 to identify ace2 receptors in the mucosal epithelium and invade however the gp120 protein in hiv allows hiv to recognise the cd4 receptor and invade cd4 t cells2 there is currently no evidence indicating that sars-cov-2 is capable of invading t cells any cells that express cd4 or any cells that do not express ace2 sars-cov-2 does not invade cells that are not prone to infection by other known coronavirusesso far the reported sars-cov-2 sequences in global initiative of sharing all influenza data and genbank database have a maximum of 10 nucleotide differences from the earliest sars-cov-2 sequence in wuhan9 to the latest sequence worldwide including europe usa and so on suggesting that sars-cov-2 entered human body recentlyalthough sars-cov-2 sars and middle east respiratory syndrome coronaviruses belong to the same large family of coronaviruses their genetic characteristics are significantly different for covid-19 transmission through respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission it has also been confirmed that live virus and virus nucleic acid can be detected in human stool10 thus we speculated that the digestive tract might be another transmission route moreover sars-cov-2 can be transmitted through aerosols under a prolonged exposure in a relatively closed environmentpatients with covid-19 often have a fever dry cough and fatigue as the primary manifestations and in some patients pharyngeal pain abdominal pain diarrhoea and conjunctivitis are common therefore if a patient has any of these symptoms even if the symptoms are mild testing for covid-19 is recommendedneurological symptoms have been observed in patients with covid-196 it has been reported that more than one-third of patients experienced various neurological symptoms including the involvement of central nervous system dizziness headache impaired consciousness acute cerebrovascular disease ataxia and epilepsy peripheral nervous system taste impairment smell impairment vision impairment and neuralgia and skeletal muscular damage skeletal muscle injury was defined when a patient had skeletal muscle pain and elevated serum creatine kinase level above 200 ul6 12 in patients with central nervous system manifestations the most common complaints were dizziness and headache in patients with peripheral nervous system manifestations the most common complaints were taste and smell impairmentthe nervous system manifestations were significantly more common in patients with severe infection manifested as ischaemic stroke and cerebral haemorrhage diagnosed by clinical symptoms and head ct impaired consciousness and skeletal muscle injury6 rapid clinical deterioration or worsening could be from a neurological event such as stroke which may have contributed to its high mortality rate the main reason of clinical worsening is the hyperactivation of inflammatory factors that eventually causes a fatal inflammatory storm as the disease progresses in addition coagulation system is damaged causing the d-dimer and platelet abnormalities which increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease during the epidemic period of covid-19 when seeing patients with above neurological manifestations especially more develop nervous system manifestations doctors should consider sars-cov-2 infection as a differential diagnosis so to avoid misdiagnosis and seize the opportunity of stopping it from infecting the othersmost patients with covid-19 have a low grade fever but a few would have high temperature it is worth noting that some patients may have difficulty breathing in some patients their lung ct scans may have signs of severe damage from the infection but their temperature remain within normal limit in these patients feeling weak or exhaustion was their main complaint in other patients their temperature may drop but their pneumonia actually progressed therefore to judge the progression of the disease lung ct is essential figure 1in laboratory examinations their premorbid routine blood test may show lymphopaenia recently some companies have developed a sars-cov-2 antibody test and its use for clinical monitoring is being studied these laboratory findings and parameters may serve as a biomarker bearing a value relevant to the prognostic perspectiveat present nucleic acid testing for sars-cov-2 is still the essential criterion and gold standard for confirming the diagnosis however its sensitivity is low and repeated tests may often be needed therefore the current consensus is that a covid-19 infected individual may present asymptomatically or symptomatically with or without abnormal laboratory findings and lung changes on ct and an unrevealing nucleic acid test the diagnosis can be confirmed if there are apparent characteristic changes on lung ct or a positive igm test for viral antibody clinically suspected patients should not be left untreated with sars-cov-2 infection while waiting for the nucleic acid test result or if nucleic acid test was negative initiallybased on the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 published by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china11 the following features need to be noted in the prevention and treatment processamong patients with sars-cov-2 infection middle-aged and elderly people accounted for the majority of strokes especially in critically ill patients serum d-dimer level is generally increased which could be the source of embolic vascular events11
12 many of these patients may already have other cerebrovascular risk factors such as hypertension diabetes mellitus hyperlipidaemia smoking or previous stroke history some may develop their first-ever acute ischaemic stroke6 therefore medical staff should pay close attention to the manifestation of neurological symptoms if an acute ischaemic stroke patient with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 are admitted emergency treatment should be jointly offered by neurologists and infectious disease specialists for ischaemic stroke patients with a high d-dimer level preventive anticoagulation is recommended these patients should be transferred to the isolation ward and neurologists would assist in the managementsince sars-cov-2 specifically binds to ace2 receptors2 patients with hypertension may encounter blood pressure fluctuations following sars-cov-2 infection which may increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage furthermore some critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 infection have severe thrombocytopaenia another high-risk factor for cerebral haemorrhage for hypertensive patients with sars-cov-2 infection it is recommended to stop using ace inhibitors or angiotensin  receptor blockers arbs as antihypertensive drugs and consider calcium channel blockers diuretics and other classes of antihypertensive drugsbased on the previous discovery coronavirus may invade the central nervous system researchers have detected sars coronavirus nucleic acid in patients cerebrospinal fluid and sars coronavirus was also verified in brain tissue on autopsy13 14 for this sars-cov-2 outbreak some patients have had symptoms similar to those with intracranial infections such as headache seizure and disturbance of consciousness few patients had central nervous system symptoms before having pulmonary symptoms6 therefore neurologists should be vigilant when seeing covid-19 infected patients and look for any signs suspicious for intracranial infection and if possible mri of head with and without contrast should be performed a lumbar puncture to look for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid by using pcr is recommended for these covid-19 patients with intracranial infection treatment strategies such as controlling cerebral oedema treating and preventing seizures and treating psychotic symptoms should be considered and the guidelines should be followedhistorically sars coronavirus was involved in the myocardial inflammation15 in clinical observation some patients with covid-19 may experience symptoms of skeletal muscle damage such as fatigue or limb aches and mild elevation of serum creatine kinase level6 they are due to inflammatory reaction caused by the sars-cov-2 infection or direct muscle damage by the virus for patients with muscle damage symptoms screening for sars-cov-2 infection is recommended in addition to active treatment of covid-19 strengthening nutritional support is recommendedin this outbreak patients with covid-19 can begin with neurological symptoms or develop neurological complications during the treatment neurologists may see these patients in the clinic emergency room and in-patient ward according to the technical guidelines for prevention and control of new coronavirus infection in medical institutions first edition16 developed by general office of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china and clinical characteristics of these patients we propose the following precautions for neurologists especially for those who are working in high-risk areas

covid-19 is a highly contagious disease that has become a worldwide pandemic patients infected may show neurological symptoms first healthcare providers and neurologists should pay close attention to these symptoms and have a high index of suspicion when evaluating patients in an endemic area early recognition may help initiate treatment and isolation early so to prevent clinical worsening and spreading of virusit is known to all that since the twenty-first century there have been three human pathogenic coronavirus outbreaks which have caused global transmission bringing huge challenges to global public health and economic development 1 they are the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 2 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 3 and the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 sars-cov-2 in 2019 4 at present there is no specific treatment planin early 2020 a case of novel coronavirus was confirmed in wuhan china 4 within a short period of time the number of confirmed cases was increasing and those infected could develop fever cough and even severe respiratory syndrome 5 which quickly drew the attention of the chinese government 6 7 researchers found that 27 of the 41 initially confirmed cases had had direct contact with a local seafood market in wuhan initially assuming that the new coronavirus might have come from wild animals sold in the market 8 gao et al collected alveolar lavage fluid from three infected patients and successfully isolated the new coronavirus 9 electron microscopy has showed that the virus has an envelop the particles are round or oval with the diameter of about 60140 nm 4 whole genome sequencing analysis has showed that the virus belongs to a new type of coronavirus of the  genus 4 in addition shi et al obtained almost identical genome-wide sequences in virus samples from 5 patients the sequence of the new coronavirus was 795 similar to sars-cov and 96 similar to the coronavirus carried by bats which might be the potential source of infection 10 another study found that the receptor binding domain of sars-cov-2 was the closest to the coronavirus carried by pangolins thus the origin of sars-cov-2 remains to be determined 11the world health organization who officially declared sars-cov-2 to be a public health emergency of international concern on january 31 due to its rapid spread furthermore the who declared sars-cov-2 to be a global pandemic on march 11 2020 12 the last time that the who declared a pandemic was h1n1 in 2009 which affected more than 70 countries and infected more than 60 million people in the united states alone 13 as of may 27 2020 sars-cov-2 had a total of 5715077 confirmed cases worldwide including 352912 deaths therefore it can be seen that it has strong transmission and pathogenicity fig 1
this review mainly investigates the current status of the epidemic provides information of sars-cov-2 on virology clinical features epidemiology diagnosis treatment prevention and the role of internet new media highlights the major issues that still need to be studied and addressedcoronavirus is the longest known rna virus with a length of 2732 kb 14 in 2014 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv divided coronaviruses into four genera     of the four coronavirus genera seven have been found to be pathogenic to humans  hcov-229e hcov-nl63  hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 sars-cov mers-cov the newly discovered sars-cov-2 also belongs to the  genus 9 15the reason that coronavirus can cause human pandemic is closely related to its special structure 16 17 the sequencing results of sars-cov-2 genome sequence showed that its genome contains about 29 kb bases and 11 protein-coding regions fig 2 including 1ab 1a s 3a 4 m 6 7a 7b 8 n 10 16 the entry of sars-cov-2 into host cells was mediated mainly by the use of spike protein s 18 therefore we performed phylogenetic analysis of s protein of the human pathogenic coronavirus fig 3 s protein is a prominent trimer structure on the surface of the virus containing two functional subunits s1 and s2 where s1 is responsible for binding to host cell surface receptors and s2 is responsible for membrane fusion between the virus and the cell there is a furan cleavage site at the boundary between s1 and s2 subunits which is mutated during virus invasion thus distinguishing sars-cov-2 from sars-cov 16 veesler et al showed that sars-cov-2 entered cells using s protein by utilizing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the surface of host cells which is widely present in human respiratory and intestinal mucosal epithelial cells enabling sars-cov-2 to infect humans and cause transmission in humans which is similar to the transmission mechanism of sars-cov 16 19 in addition studies have shown that the expression level of ace2 gene in the lungs of smokers is significantly higher than that of non-smokers and smokers are more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 20 these findings provide an important theoretical basis for drug development and epidemic prevention and control in addition an analysis of the sars-cov-2 genomic phylogenetic network revealed three types of variation which the researchers tentatively named abc where a is the ancestor type a and c mainly exist in europe and the united states while b mainly exists in east asia providing a new idea for the origin of sars-cov-2 21
the incubation period it is to point to from causative agent invader airframe or produce action to airframe commonly arrive airframe begins to appear reaction or clinical symptom when arrive the incubation period of different infectious diseases is different mainly related to the number of pathogens pathogenicity feculence and the autoimmunity of the infected person 22 determining the incubation period of infectious diseases is helpful for researchers to determine the time of infection of an person track the source of infection and determine the route of transmission 23 24 it can also provide an important theoretical basis for the air defense time of prevention and quarantine of infectious diseases on january 31 2020 the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc announced that all residents returning from the outbreak would be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantinethrough investigation and analysis of 88 patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 in the early stage backer et al preliminarily proved that the average incubation period of the disease was 64 days 95 ci 56 to 77 days 25 another study on the incubation period of sars-cov-2 showed that the incubation period of the infectious disease ranged from 2 days to 14 days 26 the latest study analyzed 181 cases of sars-cov-2 infectious using the log-normal model and predicted that the patients would show clinical manifestations within 12 days 23 the above research indicates that the average incubation period of sars-cov-2 is about 14 days but it is possible to extend the isolation observation period appropriately if necessarythe clinical symptoms of patients infected with sars-cov-2 are mainly fever fatigue and cough but more than 50 of the infected patients even have no obvious symptoms which is easy to cause missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis 27 28 in addition to respiratory symptoms some people who are infected also experience digestive symptoms such as loss of appetite nausea and vomiting 29 some severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multi-organ failure ecmo plays an important role in the treatment of critically ill patients 30 31 diarrhea a common symptom of sars-cov-2 infection also accounts for a high proportion of sars-cov-2 infections 32 33 in addition the total number of white blood cells in adult infected patients is normal or slightly decreased in general laboratory examination in which the decline of lymphocytes is more obvious c-reactive protein crp can have a slight increase and there is a slight increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr 34 in obese patients aspartate aminotransferase ldl cholesterol and lymphocyte counts decreased significantly 35 meanwhile a retrospective study found statistically significant reductions in eosinophil levels in patients with poor prognosis 36 imaging finding suggested that most of the infected patients had pneumonia chest ct is usually characterized by ground-glass opacity ggo progressive chest ct indicated increased lesions the accumulative range of lesions was expanded and in severe cases diffuse consolidation of both lungs presented as white lung 37 38 so far most of those infected have mild symptoms and a good prognosis but the mortality is as high as 17 for the elderly or those with chronic disease 39 according to the statistical analysis of the current infected data the infected age is mainly between 40 and 60 years old among which the male patients are slightly more than the female patients the infected children are rare and most of the families of infected children have other family members infected 40 in addition to the typical clinical manifestations of the respiratory and digestive systems many patients were treated for obvious skin manifestations mainly red rash on the back of trunk urticaria etc therefore it is necessary for our clinicians to find such patients in time to avoid misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis 41 42although the current statistical analysis shows that the infection rate of children is low it does not mean that children are not susceptible to disease perhaps because children have less contact with the outside environment and most families pay more attention to the health protection of children which need to be taken into account some studies have found that the average incubation period of children is longer than that of adults the clinical manifestations of infected children are relatively mild cough and fever are also common manifestations symptoms tend to subside slightly infected people or even no symptoms just positive nucleic acid test 43 more than 80 of infected children have detectable viral nucleic acids in their faeces 44 one study found that of the 10 children infected outside the wuhan 8 had direct contact with adults with a history of travel to the city the symptoms of infection in children are relatively mild and not easy to be found but the imaging examination often shows patchy infiltration if not timely treatment childrens growth and development is seriously affected 27 45 therefore children who may contact with high-risk groups should be closely monitored and isolated for early detection and intervention 45 46 since the symptoms of infected children are mild treatment with large doses of antiviral drugs or empirical antibiotics is not necessary unless the condition is severe and no other specific treatment options are available 47studies have shown that coronavirus  and  originated in bats and the other two viruses originated in birds 1 a comparative analysis of genome sequences showed that sars-cov-2 was 96 similar to coronavirus from bats and bats were likely the natural host of sars-cov-2 10 48 however there may be one or more unkonwn intemediate hosts between bats and humans just as the intermediate host of sars-cov is civet cat and the intermediate host of mers is dromedary camel 49 50most of the original sars-cov-2 infections came from a local seafood market in wuhan 51 the internal environment of the market was similar to the place where sars-cov was discovered in 2003 52 the wet and dirty environment provides favorable conditions for the virus to survive and reproduce in addition a variety of seafood was sold in the market and there was also illegal trafficking of wild animals the pathogen was likely to be one of the intermediate hosts or some wild animals 53 according to the latest research the virus strain isolated in pangolins is 99 similar to sars-cov-2 in sequence 54 it is suspected that pangolins may be the potential intermediate host of the virus pangolins were also sold in the market 55 it was likely that the first infected people ate the infected pangolins causing human-to-human transmission after the outbreak the local government moved quickly to close the market and conducted a thorough disinfection of course pangolins may not be the only intermediate host as coronaviruses have been found in many animals such as camels pigs goats and pangolins with further research it is believed that more potential intermediate hosts will be found 56 in addition to wild animals the researchers found that chickens ducks pigs and dogs were less susceptible to sars-cov-2 while cats were more susceptible to sars-cov-2 providing important information for future animal management 57 after the outbreak many regions in china have introduced relevant laws and regulations and some animals have been put on the fasting listat present the pathogenic mechanism of sars-cov-2 is still little studied and its transmission route and transmission mode are also greatly uncertain due to virus mutation and other factors epidemiological data show that sars-cov-2 has a strong infectious capacity and is highly infectious the known transmission route is mainly based on the history of the infected person and the sample of sars-cov-2 can be detected to make a guess the presence of sars-cov-2 was found in nasopharyngeal swab specimens of the infected person and the cases of cluster infection all suggested that airborne droplet transmission was the possible main transmission route 5860 confined space poor ventilation and so on are important causes of cluster infection 61 to this end on january 23 2020 the chinese government imposed a city closure on wuhan and travel restrictions on other cities to minimize unnecessary crowds currently disseminated by respiratory droplets and direct contact is clear a study collected in different regions of the hospital air sars-cov-2 testing found in the region of the medical staff and room toilet space existing in the small area is relatively high concentrations of the virus nucleic acid but whether these aerosol form of the virus has spread ability is not yet clear these need to pay attention to the prevention and control of hospital 62 63 sars-cov-2 rna was also detected in blood samples from infected patients 5 64 65 the real-time fluoresence quantitative pcr showed that the pcr cycle threshold was 351 indicating that there was a low concentration of viral nucleic acid in the blood samples and blood transmission might also be a potential transmission route of sars-cov-2 66 it also increases the difficulty of blood donation in blood centers and blood banks the high expression of ace2 receptor in the gastrointestinal tract indicates that sars-cov-2 can use ace2 receptor in the gastrointestinal tract to enter the human body so the fecal-oral pathway may be a potential transmission route of sars-cov-2 67 it is reported that the chinese center for disease control and prevention isolated the sars-cov-2 strain from stool samples from a confirmed patient in heilongjiang province indicating that sars-cov-2 could survive in feces a similar study found low levels of sars-cov-2 in the feces of some infected children 44 in addition the government of paris detected a novel coronavirus in a non-potable water system and an active novel coronavirus in sewage in massachusetts usa these studies have shown that a novel coronavirus can survive in water and be transmitted using water therefore if the water is infected by the virus even with the current stringent control measures there is still a high risk of human infection a newborn born during the outbreak at a local childrens hospital in wuhan was reported to have been diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection 30 h after birth and it was considered that sars-cov-2 might also cause an epidemic through vertical transmission 68 however another study did not find the presence of sars-cov-2 in the samples of amniotic fluid breast milk and other body fluids of 9 pregnant women infected with sars-cov-2 69 the newborns were not infected and no evidence of vertical transmission of pregnancy was found possibly due to the small sample size for health workers the possibility of vertical transmission still exists and needs to be taken seriously in the process of disease control 70 in addition there have been reports of infection in laboratory specimens and human conjunctival epithelium is susceptible to infection by infectious aerosols 71an important indicator to measure the ability of the disease to spread basic reproduction number r0 refers to the average number of infectious diseases that can be transmitted to others without the need for external intervention 72 the critical value is 1 the greater the r0 value the more difficult to control the epidemic with the participation of all countries in the world the r0 value is also changing initially zhao et al estimated that the initial r0 value of sars-cov-2 was between 35 and 55 slightly higher than sars-cov the latest study shows that r0 is around 268 roughly the same as the r0 reported by the who and the chinese cdc 73 74 at present sars-cov-2 is spreading rapidly all over the world with the cumulative number of infected people excedding 160000 if no corresponding measures are taken the epidemic situation will worsen as a global village such a big family the global countries should unite and work together to control the r0 value below 1 75 a retrospective study of patients infected with novel coronavirus in a local hospital in wuhan found that elderly men patients with hypertension and heart disease were more likely to suffer from serious complications with a poor survival prognosis and a high mortality rate which were required close attention 76the quality of samples determines the sensitivity and specificity of viral nucleic acid detection the virus detection rate of bronchusalveolar lavage fluid is relatively high due to the relatively high viral load in the respiratory tract specimens of infected persons but sampling is difficult to get routine clinical collection of nasopharyngeal swabs blood stool and other samples but the collection of these samples is susceptible to sampling materials sampling sites sampling time and sampling personnels operation therefore it is recommended to test negative specimens for patients with suspicious clinical symptoms multiple times take samples from multiple sites and conduct standard sampling by skilled personneldue to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic there are not enough clinical samples of the detection kits developed by various companies or scientific research insitutions for complete performance confirmation therefore the stability and reliability of various nucleic acid detection kits need to be further verified here it is recommended to use the detection kit containing the control and it should match with the laboratory equipment and extract virus samples in strict accordance with the standard operating procedures of the kit and set up detection procedures the detection personnel should also analyze the situation of the whole amplification curve and the individual amplification curve after amplification and the amplification curve is required to present a single peak specific smooth curve followed by adjusting the detection procedure according to the dissolution curve in addition a reasonable indoor quality control scheme is of vital importance we suggest that one weak positive quality control and three negative quality controls should be set up for each batch of test all three negative quality controls should be negative and weak positive quality control should be positive which is considered as the control of this batch of test otherwise it is out of control and cannot issue a test report if necessary it should be retested for positive results we should ensure that the fluorescence quantitative pcr results of at least two targets 1bane in the test are positive when only one target is positive rechecking and even resampling should be requested as much as possible for the negative results the infection cannot be completely excluded and comprehensive analysis of the patients symptoms medical history and imaging findings is also needed 83 84 standard and reasonable test report is very important for clinicians to make correct judgment with the spread of sars-cov-2 countries all over the world need rapid and effective methods to detect their own people a rapid detection method of crispr-cas12 was found which was mainly used to detected sars-cov-2 in respiratory throat swab with a sensitivity of up to 95 and specificity of 100 31 there are similar colloidal gold immunochromatography side flow immunoassay which can quickly and sensitively detect specific antibodies in the serum 85in addition to laboratory tests imaging findings are critical for disease diagnosis routine x-ray examination is convenient and quick however because the overlapping images will affect the observation of doctors on the lesions and the sensitivity and specificity are low it is easy to miss diagnosis which has not played an obvious role in this outbreak ct examination is another important imaging examination for respiratory diseases and plays an important role in the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 pneumonia 86 patients infected with sars-cov-2 can be divided into three stages according to their condition the early ct manifestations of the lesion were mainly local lesions patchy segmental distribution and the lesions were mostly seen in the outer 13 lung field and subpleural in the progressive stage ct mainly presents increased lesions with expanded scope involving multiple pulmonary lobes with most of the lower lobes in the critical stage ct mainly presents diffuse lesions lung consolidation distorted structure and white lung in severe cases 37 38 imaging findings of diseases also played a crucial role in early diagnosis which should be paid more attention in the case of epidemic 87 88in addition to early detection and early diagnosis of the disease early treatment is crucial to the prognosis of the disease since the outbreak many research institutions around the world have been conducting clinical trials using existing potential drugs for in vivo and in vitro research at present there are mainly antiviral drugs anti-inflammatory drugs and some drugs have achieved significant effects but it is still some time before the treatment of covid-19 patients 89 90 studies have shown that ace2 is the receptor for sars-cov-2 to enter cells and ace2 is present in large quantities in human lung and small intestinal epithelial cells which is essential for the spread of the epidemic similarly ace2 is a potential therapeutic target 91 92 it has been found that recombinant human soluble ace2 can inhibit the growth of sars-cov-2 and significantly block the early stage infection of novel coronavirus which is an important discovery for the treatment of patients with new crown disease 93 in addition the use of ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs can provide protection to the cardiovascular and renal systems of covid-19 patients 94 there are many similar therapies that inhibit the action mechanism of s protein and ace2 95 a combination of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir has been recommended for clinical trial in the latest guidelines 96 in addition remdesivir also a broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drug has been shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 cell infection in vitro 89 the first sars-cov-2 patient in the united states showed a marked improvement in symptoms after being treated with rdv which opened the possibility for further clinical application 97 clinical trials of the drug have also been carried out in china which has a large number of infected people favipiravir was approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection in 2014 through the clinical comparison of 200 covid-19 patients it was found that the pneumonia symptoms of the patients receiving favipiravir were significantly improved with no obvious side effects 98 with the increasing number of studies on confirmed cases some drugs with immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects have also been used in the treatment of covid-19 patients studies have found that the hypercoagulable state of blood is related to the severity of the disease an anticoagulant drug dipyridamole dip can inhibit the replication of novel coronavirus significantly improve the condition of severe patients and play a positive role in the treatment of patients 63 chloroquine originally used to treat malaria was found to inhibit the activity of the sars virus in vitro during the sars epidemic mainly by altering the glycosylation of the viral receptor ace2 thereby affecting the virus to invade cells recent studies have shown that the combined application of ridsivir and chloroquine can effectively inhibit the in vitro activity of sars-cov-2 99 in addition chloroquine also has immunomodulatory effects can inhibit the emergence and progression of viral diseases 100 abidol has a broad spectrum antiviral effect on respiratory virus and can also inhibit the activity of sars-cov-2 in vitro 101 currently the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia by abidol has entered into phase 4 clinical trials and is likely to be applied in treatment in the future many studies have shown that steroids can effectively suppress lung inflammation but they can also inhibit the bodys immune response and pathogen clearance 102 steroids were widely used during the sars and mers outbreaks but their side effects also had a huge impact on patients health in the current outbreak of sars-cov-2 the who on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection recommend against the use of steroids unless specifically requested if steroids are used it is necessary to pay attention to monitor blood sugar electrolytes during use and may even appear symptoms of central excitation such as insomnia etc can be symptomatic treatment in general steroid therapy is not recommended in the clinical treatment of sars-cov-2 103 fibrinolytic enzyme levels and increased activity were found in blood tests of confirmed patients in vitro experiments it was found that the serine protease inhibitor tmprss2 could prevent novel coronavirus from entering cells significantly improving the clinical prognosis of patients 104 vaccines are essential for preventing and treating infectious diseases in addition to protecting healthy people from infection in an outbreak vaccines can also help those infected rebuild their immune systems to control or cure the disease currently many research teams are developing new coronavirus vaccines the university of pittsburgh study found a vaccine against sars-cov-2 which in animal studies has shown to make mice produce antibodies against sars-cov-2 and neutralize the virus 105 in addition some medical teams in china are using plasma from infected patients and traditional chinese medicine treatment regimens a study using convalescent plasma therapy found that in four of five infected patients body temperature returned to normal after the infusion of convalescent plasma and in three patients mechanical ventilation was not required after 2 weeks although the number of cases in the study is small and the effect of convalescent plasma therapy still needs to be further verified the effect is quite significant 57 at present there are successful cases of patients with new crowns all over the world but it is difficult to carry out these protocols on a large scale due to the lack of systematic control analysis therefore we look forward to the early development of effective treatments 106 107in the current situation of rapid spread of the epidemic and there is no special treatment effective epidemic prevention measures to contain the spread of the epidemic is crucial at present chinas sealed measures restrictions on residents travel and traffic control have played a significant role in controlling the spread of the epidemic retrospective studies have found that traffic restrictions have significantly reduced the number of cases outside hubei 108 for china which is celebrating the traditional spring festival the traditional way of commemorating has been changed all live parties have been cancelled all scenic spots have been closed to tourists and crowds have been avoided by all means meanwhile in an effort to prevent further spread of the virus the chinese government paid for the construction of two new hospitals in wuhan in 10 days to treat the infected and sent medical teams across the country to provide support for countries outside china the monitoring of passing tourists has been increased at airports ports and other transportation arteries mainly including temperature detection and symptom screening to avoid the occurrence of imported cases at present chinas epidemic control is relatively stable and its various measures have been copied by other countries 109 although the source and transmission route of sars-cov-2 are not clear enough the main method is still to control the population flow the early detection of cases isolation of cases and isolation of susceptible groups do a good job of disinfection measures to prevent the further spread of the disease in addition to significantly limiting the spread of the disease the closure has also resulted in significant improvements in the citys air quality 110 in the event of a global pandemic unnecessary travel should be avoided in addition to limiting the movement of people and cutting off potential transmission it is also important to protect individual residents from travel in the early stage of the outbreak due to the shutdown of various enterprises insufficient production capacity of medical protective equipment such as masks and protective clothing residents could not buy enough protective equipment or even buy fake protective equipment which could not play a protective role a study of both surgical and cotton masks found that the virus appeared on the outside of the masks and did not completely prevent the virus from spreading so hands must be disinfected when came into contact with the surface of the masks 36to prevent outbreaks during epidemics it is usually necessary to isolate high-risk groups and areas restrict travel and movement of people and try to avoid transmission between people since the outbreak some measures have been taken all over the world especially in china where there has been a massive quarantine for those who have experienced isolation it is often an unpleasant experience for uninfected people during the period of isolation they lose their freedom lose their security and tend to be impulsive and angry during the period of isolation in various areas there will often be conflicts between residents and epidemic prevention personnel for those who are infected or may be infected they will lose their freedom during the period of isolation be separated from their families and have insufficient understanding of their own illness as a result they are more likely to have psychological problems in severe cases they even give up their lives and commit suicide therefore for large-scale isolation it must be implemented on the basis of adequate measurement in response to the outbreak tens of thousands of infected people in china where quarantine measures were first introduced did not experience mass unrest instead everyone was very cooperative with medical workers people living in isolated homes and interacting with each other have been reported in the global media good mental attitude is also crucial for the recovery of the diseaseas front-line medical workers during the epidemic period their workload significantly increased and their work risk also significantly increased therefore their mental health needs more attention high intensity medical work lack of rest but also need to undertake some patients do not understand the negative emotions easy to focus on the work poor emotional control and other uncomfortable performance in order to timely understand the psychological health of medical staff the anonymous psychological questionnaire can better help medical staff to solve psychological problems help psychological counseling staff to better reduce pressure enhance the information of medical staff help them relieve psychological pressure and better engage in medical workin a word in order to minimize and avoid psychological and social problems caused by isolation the most important thing is to shorten the isolation time as far as possible the longer the isolation the greater the impact scientific and reasonable isolation period may be able to make people more understanding understanding willing to accept cooperate in addition the quarantined should actively provide more information to the quarantined during the quarantine period and fully understand themselves health conditions and the status of the epidemic control so that the quarantined can reduce fear in addition the quarantined personnel during the period of isolation the loss of economic resources the loss of basic security of life therefore adequate material support is necessary for the quarantined people to meet their basic living needs and provide them with psychological comfort making them more willing to believe that the national community can help them survive the epidemic 111114the emergence of new infectious diseases is a great challenge to global human health public health and social development in todays society with developed network technology the sharing of epidemic information plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases 115 under the strict epidemic prevention measures the network and new media play an irreplaceable role of traditional media but because cyberspace is a virtual world there are real messages but also false messages some malicious organizations or individuals use false information to cause social panic and hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic at this point the mainstream media needs to clarify in a timely and accurate manner to prevent the situation from getting worsethe internet and new media have played a crucial role in the outbreak 1be the first to disclose the epidemic situation and play an early warning role network media workers as social current affairs scouts with keen eyes flexible ears and wise mind constantly monitor the situation around and can be the fastest speed to convey all kinds of news to the public 2assisted traditional media to transmit epidemic information after the outbreak of the epidemic the public has an urgent need for information new online media can disclose information timely accurately and comprehensively and some mainstream media can even invite the authorities to give professional explanations on the epidemic situation to meet the publics information needs 3actively guide public opinion set up a correct value orientation in a sudden outbreak the general public will experience panic and negative behavior to some extent in addition to timely transmission of information mainstream network media can also carry out public opinion guidance help the public correctly understand and analyze events and cultivate the publics psychological bearing capacitysars-cov-2 is a highly transmissible virus that has caused a worldwide epidemic at present there is no specific treatment plan which can only reduce the incidence of new cases by reducing the crowd gathering virus elimination personal protection and other work in the nearly 4 months since the outbreak was discovered more than a million people have been infected worldwide most countries around the world are testing their populations for potential cases isolating them as nearly as possible and preventing the spread of the disease 116 at first it was thought that the virus would disappear in nature as temperatures rose but the current global outbreak appears to be under control with thousands of cases still being diagnosed in many countries every day some scholars predict that sars-cov-2 may persist in nature and may erupt repeatedly each winter 117 in this outbreak china performed very well and actively supported other countries to fight the epidemic after its own outbreak was under control facts have proved that chinas action to close down the city is correct the rapid control of the epidemic cannot be achieved without the joint efforts of the government and the public the whole country and all walks of life have paid a huge price most chinese companies have gradually resumed production and most schools have opened wuhan which had been sealed has reopened to prevent a repeat of the outbreak the chinese government has mandated that all returning workers and students be quarantined for 14 days and that everyone in high-risk areas and occupations be tested for antibodies besides have obvious symptoms of infection the crowd there are a large number of asymptomatic infection although these people themselves in good health but will be coronavirus is positive for nucleic acid detection and these asymptomatic infections can still will infect the others around you the prevention and control of epidemic diseases bring huge challenges only symptomatic infection control is not enough 118121 there are still many difficulties in preventing and controlling the epidemic thousands of people are diagnosed every day in the united states italy russia and other countries as the currently has the largest number of the united states confirmed its domestic unemployment increased many small and medium-sized enterprise bankruptcy the stock market turmoil several historic fusing part of the supply of medical resources cost huge financial resources and forced the united states to increase the printing of dollars this has also had a major impact on countries with dollar reserves with some governments declaring bankruptcy 122 one breath one destiny for all countries in the world only by working together to fight the sars-cov-2 and help each other can we overcome the difficulties and restore prosperity as soon as possiblefirst in wuhan china sarscov2 arose as a new viral infection and is currently named coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 new sarscov2 along with the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov and sarscov are different strains of coronaviruses belonging to the coronavirus cluster p zhou et al 2020 sarscov2 the chief pathogen of the human respiratory system is the third zoonotic coronavirus disease and the third major medical crisis with a different genome from sarscov sarscov2 is mostly transmitted by respiratory system droplets gastric tract and close human interaction and is located in the nasal mucosa mouth and lungs of exposed individuals of note middleaged and elderly individuals as well as patients with chronic or autoimmune underlying diseases are most susceptible to be infection by sarscov2 incredibly coronavirus has become a critical challenge in global public health due to rapid development and extreme spread by active carriers in humantohuman transmission riou  althaus 2020 clinically covid19 brings about very severe respiratory infections and lethal sickness the same as sars and mers besides respiratory system injury covid19 hurts various organs including the kidney liver gastrointestinal and neurologic systems yin  wunderink 2018 structurally the coronavirus is characterized as an enveloped nonsegmented and singlestranded rna virus the structure is composed of an envelope e nucleocapsid n membrane m and spike s proteins both e and m proteins have a central role in virus assembly and release of the virus schoeman  fielding 2019 sheikh altaher alnazawi almubarak  kandeel 2020 the s protein an immense multipurpose viral transmembrane protein induces immune responses by mediating the virus attachment to host receptors f li 2016 the n protein a multifunctional protein is identified as a viral rna silencing suppressor the n protein has a substantial role in viral transcription and replication and is involved in packaging the encapsidated genome into virions regarding the overexpression and high immunogenicity of n protein it can be considered as a potential diagnostic target for sarscov2 detection hurst koetzner  masters 2009after exposure the virus enters into target cells and acts by binding to its receptor the socalled angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 is present on type i and ii alveolar epithelial cells of healthy lung tissue also it has been reported that organ failure can occur all over the body if organ cells express ace2 the interaction between sarscov2 and ace2 leads to overexpression of ace2 resulting in alveolar cell detriment interstitial and alveolar edema respiratory system failure and ards y zhao et al 2020 among various laboratory abnormalities lymphopenia with or without leukocyte irregularities is commonly observed as a major paraclinical criterion of covid19 infected patients l zhou  liu 2020 according to sarscov2 immunopathogenesis lymphopenia is characterized by a decrease in lymphocytes particularly cd8 t cells and a slight increase in neutrophils wan et al 2020moreover it has been found that sarscov2 can indirectly infect immune cells mostly t cells and macrophages and elicits their destruction increased frequency of infected immune cells lymphopenia and high levels of inflammatory cytokines are considered as the most related elements to covid19 immunopathogenesis j liu et al 2020 in this regard elevated levels of pro and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor tnf granulocyte colonystimulating factor gcsf macrophage inflammatory protein mip1a monocyte chemoattractant protein1 mcp1 interferon gammainduced protein10 ip10 interleukin1 il1 il2 il6 il7 and il10 have been documented in covid19 patients with severe conditions which generate the cytokine storm it seems that the cytokine storm is the primary phenomenon of virus pathogenesis leading to inflammation lung injury ards and other organ failures wan et al 2020hence there is a critical need for the detection of the infected or suspected cases as soon as possible to apply the appropriate treatments for covid19 and prevent the spread of virus for this reason in this review we will focus on the importance of diagnostic techniques by describing the different clinical and paraclinical diagnostic approaches related assays for both groups advantages and disadvantages technical comparison and food and drug administration fda approved rapid tests figure 1 the current review provides a comprehensive overview of covid19 diagnostic methods due to the importance of diagnosis in preventing the sarscov2 spread and controlling the infectionthe importance of different diagnostic methods of covid19 has been emphasized in many studies several studies have been designed or are underway to investigate the efficacy of covid19 diagnostic methods and have been listed in table 1 overall covid19 diagnostic methods are categorized into clinical diagnosis physical examination clinical features and the radiological findings and paraclinical diagnosis paraclinical diagnostic approaches include molecular assays or nucleic acid amplification tests naats viral sequencing serological assays and viral culture realtime polymerase chain reaction rtpcr assays particularly realtime reversetranscriptase pcr rrtpcr are the most applicable method among naats the rtpcr is usually utilized to detect the sarscov2 virus qualitatively virus sequencing by sanger sequencing and nextgeneration sequencing ngs methods has applications when the results of the molecular assays are unreliable serological assays have been developed based on detecting specific immunoglobulin m igm and igg antibodies or viral antigens recently the use of serological tests to rule out or confirm the infection specifically in negative naats has been suggested due to the ease of use quick presentation of results as well as acceptable specificity and sensitivity contrarily viral culture does not need to be used for detection due to the research aspect of culture however it can be applied to determine the contagiousness of the infection the presence of the virus at different surfaces and study the efficacy of various treatments on cultured cells in the following we have described in detail the different types of diagnostic methods in the two general clinical and paraclinical categoriessample collection is an important procedure that should be done correctly to achieve accurate diagnostic results with regard to the transmission of the sarscov2 through the respiratory tract fecaloral and body fluids anal swabs oral swabs and blood samples are different methods of sample collection for diagnosis of the novel coronavirus w zhang et al 2020 a recent study has analyzed repeated sample collection from positive cases which showed that 15 infected patients still had a virus after days of receiving treatments they further reported that they might have more positive oral swabs on the first day of sampling and more positive anal swabs on the late period of sampling notably prolonged positive stool samples are not correlated with the severity of the disease and some positive rectal swabs may have no gastrointestinal symptoms accordingly the covid19 patients could not be discharged based on negative oral swabs while they could transmit the virus from the fecaloral route according to their reports eight patients 533 had positive oral swabs four patients 267 had positive anal swabs six patients 40 had positive blood samples and three patients 20 had positive serum samples two patients had positive results in both anal and oral swabs but none of the patients with positive blood samples had positive swab results the above results indicated that patients may have negative swabs results while they are still in viremic condition additionally infected patients may have a negative oral swab whereas they have positive anal swabs or positive blood samples wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 also they evaluated the levels of igm and igg antibodies in samples on day 0 and day 5 the positive rate of igm shifted from 50 to 81 and the positive rate of igg shifted from 81 to 100 on the basis of a high detection rate of antibody titers it is beneficial to assess both serological and molecular tests in suspected patientsone of the latest studies has analyzed 1070 samples collected from different sites of 205 infected patients the specimens were collected from the pharynx urine feces sputum blood and nasal fibrobronchoscope brush biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavages were taken from patients in severe conditions or those under mechanical ventilation results have shown that the highest positive rate for the virus belongs to bronchoalveolar lavage specimens 93 also the positive rate of the other specimens was as follows sputum 72 nasal swabs 63 fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy 46 pharyngeal swabs 32 feces 29 and blood samples 1 none of the urine samples showed positive results as a result sampling from different sites of the suspected patients increases the sensitivity rate of diagnosis and decreases the falsenegative results w wang kang liu  tong 2020 another study evaluated the viral load of serial specimens from multiple sites of two patients in beijing their reports indicated that the viral load in sputum and throat swabs elevated on 56 days the sputum specimens showed a higher viral load compared with the other clinical specimens moreover two patients had positive rtpcr test results a day before the onset of clinical symptoms hence infected people can transmit the virus to others before the manifestation of their symptoms pan zhang yang poon  wang 2020 a study has reported a suspected patient with three negative oropharyngeal swabs for covid19 before admission to a hospital in beijing the test results were positive for influenza accordingly 5 days after admission in the hospital his positive test result for novel coronavirus happened by alveolar lavage specimen hence we should consider that the suspected patients with negative test results for novel coronavirus may be diagnosed eventually y han  yang 2019on the basis of the research oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs are common upper respiratory tract samples for diagnosing the novel coronavirus nevertheless we should consider that this kind of sample collection would increase the transmission rate of the virus from patients to healthcare workers furthermore this invasive sample collection method may traumatize the respiratory tracts and cause bleeding especially in patients with thrombocytopenia j fw chan yuan et al 2020 however the mentioned methods are not appropriate for viral load serial monitoring the sputum is a noninvasive specimen from the lower respiratory tract however a case series study demonstrated that only 28 of the suspected patients could produce sputum for the diagnosis process c huang et al 2020 additionally saliva specimens are noninvasive sample collection methods that would not increase the risk of transmission to healthcare workers studies have represented that saliva specimens and nasopharyngeal swabs have a 90 concordance rate indeed some viruses may be identifed in saliva but not in nasopharyngeal samples k k w to et al 2019to et al investigated the novel coronavirus in saliva specimens from 12 laboratoryconfirmed patients in hong kong as a result 11 of 12 patients 917 had positive results in their initial saliva specimens the average viral load of the samples was 33  106 copiesml 99  102 12  108 copiesml the serial saliva samples of the patients demonstrated a declining route of viral load moreover the positive viral culture in saliva showed the existence of the live virus in saliva this study introduced the saliva sample collection as a noninvasive and costeffective procedure for the diagnosis and viral load monitoring of the novel coronavirus patients themselves can make this kind of sample collection interestingly the possibility of nosocomial infection will be decreased by administrating this sample collection type on the contrary humantohuman transmission can easily occur through saliva so it is essential to identify the strategies to prevent the transmission of virus to dentists and healthcare workers sabinosilva jardim  siqueira 2020 to et al 2020 considerably it is required to note that the primary handling of the specimens should be done under biosafety level3 bsl3 conditionsaccording to recent literature the severity of the novel coronavirus has been divided into three subsets mild moderate and severe the patients in the mild category almost always show the signs and symptoms of an upper respiratory viral infection such as mild fever sore throat dry cough nasal congestion headache fatigue and myalgia the clinical symptoms of a serious disease like dyspnea is absent in these patients probably the cases may have a gastrointestinal manifestation diarrhea nausea and vomiting in the moderate group patients exhibit respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough likewise children may have tachypnea at this level the patients in the severe group show fever severe dyspnea respiratory distress reduction in the saturation of the oxygen spo2  90 on room air and tachypnea almost  30 beatsmin at this stage the diagnosis of the disease would be clinical but laboratory tests rtpcr results and radiological findings can assist the clinician to achieve the final diagnosis cascella rajnik cuomo dulebohn  di napoli 2020 another study showed the diagnostic criteria in suspected children at first we should consider the exposure contact with the covid19 infected patients it is essential to know the past medical illnesses and drug histories the substantial issues include immunocompromised or immune deficiency states usage of longterm immunosuppressants severe malnutrition congenital heart disease anomalies of the respiratory tract and bronchopulmonary hypoplasia on the basis of their reports the stratification of suspected children would be as follows
1silent infection asymptomatic patients at this level patients have laboratoryconfirmed covid19 whereas they do not manifest any clinical symptoms2acute respiratory tract infection the patients have only cough fever sore throat fatigue myalgia and nasal congestion the radiological images do not display the involvement of the lung in pneumonia3mild pneumonia at this level radiological images evidence pneumonia patients may have a fever and involvement of the respiratory tract these patients are not in the severe condition of the disease4severe pneumonia the signs and symptoms of these patients are as follows1decrease in the saturation level of oxygen spo2  922increased respiratory rate 70 timesmin 1 year 50 timesmin 1 year3hypoxia nasal flaring and cyanosis4changes in mental status and consciousness5anorexia and the existence of dehydration signs5critical cases these patients need to receive icu care the complications of the critical cases include shock a respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and other organ failures shen et al 2020
the centers for disease control cdc have reported that the newly prevalent virus has mild to severe clinical manifestations in many cases and sometimes leads to death cdc in the suspected patients symptoms almost appear as fever cough fatigue pneumonia and respiratory distress whereass some symptoms such as rhinorrhea diarrhea hemoptysis headache and phlegmproducing cough are rare in these patients adhikari et al 2020 from the recent literature covid19 clinical features have some similarities to the manifestations of the other coronaviruses such as merscov and sarscov the common symptoms of the disease prove that the targeted cells for the virus are located in the lower respiratory tract however few patients indicate involvement of upper respiratory tract symptoms for instance sore throat sneezing and rhinorrhea gastrointestinal symptoms diarrhea are infrequent in covid19 patients while 2025 of the patient with sarscov and merscov had diarrhea one of the recent studies reported that the mortality rate of covid19 is approximately 2 and is lower than those of the other coronaviruses mers mortality rate 30 and sars mortality rate 40 in aged patients chang et al 2020 c huang et al 2020 analyzed the clinical features of the 41 covid19 patients the common clinical features that they reported were fever 98 cough 76 fatigue 44 the production of sputum 28 headache 8 hemoptysis 8 and diarrhea 3 on the basis of their reports 55 of the patients showed dyspnea during their hospitalization they anticipated 7 days as the median time from the onset of initial symptoms to the first admission in hospitals also they predicted 89 days for the median time from the onset of initial symptoms to the development of dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards eventually mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit icu admission happened at around day 10 the mortality rate of this cohort study was 15 641 x yang et al 2020 analyzed 52 criticallyill covid19 patients the most common clinical manifestations were fever 98 cough 77 and dyspnea 635 the median time to confirm with imaging findings was 5 days and to icu admission was about 9 days most of the patients in the study had endorgan damage such as ards 67 liver damage 29 acute kidney injury 29 cardiac injury 23 and pneumothorax 2 the mortality rate of the patients was 615 the median duration from icu admission to death was 12 weeks in comparison the nonsurvivors were older and had concomitant past medical histories the nonsurvivor patients were more predisposed to develop ards and to receive invasivenoninvasive mechanical ventilation accordingly older patients 65 years who have ards and concomitant medical illnesses are highly susceptible to death by covid19a recent singlecenter caseseries study has examined 138 hospitalized covid19 patients at the zhongnan hospital of wuhan the average age was 56 and 543 were male the most common clinical manifestations were fever 986 fatigue 696 and cough 594 some complications such as ards 611 arrhythmia 444 and shock 306 caused the transference of 261 of the patients to the icu in comparison the icu admitted older patients had concomitant illnesses who were more likely to have had anorexia and dyspnea on the basis of the final reports the hospitalrelated transmission was estimated in 41 of the patients moreover 26 of patients were transferred to the icu and the mortality rate was 43 d wang et al 2020the seventh australian epidemiological report for covid19 evaluated 295 infected cases the average age of the patients was 47 and most of the patients were aged 5059 and 6069 years also the death cases were older than 70 only 53 of the patients had clinical symptoms the characteristics included fever 69 cough 54 sore throat 46 shortness of breath 35 diarrhea 31 pneumonia ards and joint pain 1 the median interval to recovery from the disease is different in different age groups estimated from 27 days in 2029 years old patients to 36 days in patients older than 70 years old also the severity of the disease has a direct correlation with the time interval to recovery covid19 2020zhao et al evaluated the clinical manifestations of 19 covid19 cases of pneumonia and 15 noncovid19 cases of pneumonia according to the reports the median time from onset of the clinical symptoms to hospital admission was 5 days in covid19 patients and 4 days in noncovid19 patients the most common clinical symptoms were fever and cough in both groups likewise all the patients showed evidence of pulmonary infection on their computed tomography ct images in short there are no significant differences in regard to clinical features and imaging abnormalities between covid19 and noncovid19 patients so laboratory tests and rtpcr results would be helpful to differentiate the covid19 patients d zhao et al 2020 z hu et al 2020 evaluated 24 rtpcr confirmed covid19 patients in nanjing the mentioned cases had not shown any clinical manifestations close monitoring of the patients showed that five patients 208 showed clinical symptoms cough fever etc the younger cases did not develop clinical characteristics the reports of the study demonstrated that the mean communicable time interval from the first positive nucleic acid test result to the first negative result is approximately 95 days on the basis of the reports a substantial proportion of suspected cases are asymptomatic thus close monitoring of these cases by rtpcr laboratory tests and radiological modalities would be required to control the spread rate of virus a recent study has demonstrated that initial symptoms of covid19 infectionthe most complicated symptom of this highlypathogenic virus is respiratory distress also some of the patients revealed neurological signs such as nausea vomiting approximately 1 and headache approximately 8 these signs prove that the virus can invade the central nervous as well furthermore studies demonstrated that coronaviruses could spread from chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the lung to the medullary cardiorespiratory center through synapseconnected routes it seems that the infection of the nervous system could be a reason for the respiratory failure of the coronavirusaccording to research the average time interval from the onset of initial symptom to dyspnea is 5 days that to admission in hospital is 7 days and that to receive intensive care is 8 days this latency time interval is enough for the virus to penetrate the nervous system and destroy the medullary neurons y c li bai  hashikawa 2020 both the neuroinflammatory process and hypoxia in the brain would lead to neurological and psychiatric symptoms of the virus steardo steardo  zorec 2020 another clinical symptom of the novel coronavirus is affecting olfactory function the 2019ncov requires ace2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 receptors to enter cells and destroy them olfactory stem cells and olfactory epithelial support cells express both mentioned receptors on their cell surface so anosmia and olfactory dysfunction are new clinical aspects of the covid19 brann tsukahara weinreb logan  datta 2020 a recent case series study evaluated the clinical manifestations of 38 covid19 patients in hubei province onethird of the patients had ocular symptoms such as chemosis conjunctival hyperemia and epiphora they showed that the patients in severe conditions of covid19 may have ocular abnormalities p wu et al 2020taken together the most typical clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus include fever dry cough and fatigue notably the less common symptoms in suspected patients headache nausea and vomiting anosmia cognitive impairments sore throat etc should be considered moreover some patients may not indicate any clinical manifestations at the onset of their illness so it is essential to monitor highly suspect patients with rtpcr laboratory tests and radiological images the clinical characteristics of the other studies have been represented in table 2covid19 sarscov2 as well as other coronaviruses such as sarscov and merscov can lead to coronaviral pneumonia and ards according to recent reports some diagnostic radiological imaging has been discovered in coronaviral pneumonia these findings demonstrate the disruption of pulmonary parenchyma interstitial inflammation and consolidations the ct scan is a preliminary diagnostic approach in covid19 suspected patients with viral pneumonia the typical ct findings include involvement of the lower respiratory tract bilateral and peripheral pure groundglass opacities ggos or combined with consolidations mainly in the subpleural site in the lower lobes and crazypaving patterns thickening the interlobular septa and intralobular lines accompanied by ggos generally bilateral ggos and consolidations in the chest imaging of the patients with clinical symptoms would confirm the diagnosis of the covid19 however normal imaging would not exclude the diagnosis of the covid19 completely kanne 2020 it is worth noting that the related ct lesions increase within the first 10 weeks especially 913 days after infection onset after that a plateau phase happens and reduction in lesions occurs gradually kanne little chung elicker  ketai 2020 pan ye et al 2020 evaluated the imaging findings of 21 rtpcr confirmed covid19 patients by serial ct scan with a 4 days interval on the basis of their reports four stages of the lung involvement are described based on ct findings of the covid19 recovered patients as follows
1earlystage 04 days at this stage some patients may have no ct findings however the next pulmonary cts would demonstrate changes the main abnormalities in this stage are ggos which are allocated unilateralbilateral subpleural in the lower lobes2progressive stage 58 days at this stage the ggos are distributed multifocally in other lobes also consolidations and crazypaving patterns are identified in this stage3peak stage 913 days at this stage the peak involvement of the lungs occurs the ct findings of this stage are diffuse ggos and consolidations residual pulmonary bands and crazypaving patterns4absorption stage 14 days at this stage the absorption and healing process starts it seems that the viral infection is controlled the crazypaving pattern and consolidations do not exist anymore however diffuse ggos may be present as a characteristic of absorbed consolidations
these stages demonstrate that the severity of the lung lesions happens in the first 10 days of ct infection the improvement of the ct findings initiates at least 14 days after the initial symptoms huang et al reported on the clinical epidemiological laboratory and imaging results of 41 covid19 confirmed chinese patients the reports showed the lung involvement of all patients on admission accordingly 40 out of 41 patients 98 had bilateral pulmonary involvement in imaging the chest ct images of the icuadmitted patients showed bilateral lobular consolidations however the chest ct images of the patients out of icu showed bilateral ggos it is worth noting that the consolidations were resolved in later chest cts but the ggos remained c huang et al 2020 song et al 2020 investigated the clinical symptoms laboratory results and chest ct findings in 51 suspected patients according to their reports 77 of patients had only ggos in their imaging 55 had consolidations alone in their ct and 59 had ggo and consolidations simultaneously moreover they reported that patients older than 50 years exhibited more consolidated lung abnormalities among those patients 86 showed bilateral pulmonary involvement also 86 of patients had peripheral lung involvement furthermore the chest ct followup illustrated a 54 improvement and a 31 progression in contrast as a consequence a case with clinical symptoms combined with positive exposure contact which had bilateral and peripheral ggo andor consolidations on ct would be highly suspect for having covid19 lung involvement chung and bernheim 2020 reported the initial ct findings of 21 covid19 patients from three hospitals of three provinces in china three patients 14 had a normal ct scan of the 18 patients the affected lobes were seen as follows one affected lobe in one 5 two affected lobes in two 10 three affected lobes in three 14 four affected lobes in four 19 and five affected lobes in eight 38 the most involved lobe in the initial ct included the right lower lobe in 76 the left upper lobe in 67 the left lower lobe in 67 the right upper lobe in 67 and the right middle lobe in 57 of the 18 patients with lung involvement 16 had bilateral opacities and 2 had unilateral lung opacities the right lung was involved in both groups moreover ggos 57 consolidations 29 a linear abnormality 14 the crazypaving pattern 19 and the peripheral distribution of viral pneumonia 21 were found in patients also they have reported that none of the patients ct had lymphadenopathy pleural effusion cavitation pulmonary emphysema fibrosis and pulmonary nodulesbernheim et al 2020 evaluated the typical ct findings of 121 suspected patients which were related to the time between the onset of the clinical symptoms and the first screening ct scan as a result 2036 patients 56 who had undergone ct imaging 02 days after the onset of clinical symptoms had normal ct they reported that bilateral lung involvement was seen in 1036 28 early patients 2533 76 intermediate patients taking ct 35 days after the onset of the clinical symptoms and 2225 88 late patients taking ct 612 days after the onset of the clinical symptoms it seems that the unilateralbilateral peripheral lung involvement in covid19 patients occurs long time after the onset of the symptomsw yang et al 2020 evaluated the clinical and imaging findings of 149 patients the imaging findings reports demonstrate that lung involvement is more localized in peripheral 359 than central 215 regions likewise the lesions are more in a patchy shape 3935 than oval 66 moreover the results showed that 17 of the 149 patients had normal initial ct findings the chest ct findings of 5 patients turned positive in 7 days but the imaging manifestations of the residual 12 patients remained negative it seems that the absence of imaging findings on ct in covid19 suspected patients could not exclude a patient from the diagnosisng et al 2020 analyzed the radiological findings in the chest radiograph cxr and ct of the 21 covid19 confirmed patients from four previous publications two patients had normal ct findings the predominant imaging abnormality in 19 residual patients was ggo all the ggos and occasional consolidations were in peripheral locations of the lungs except from one patient that had groundglass involvement in the perihilar site also some changes such as pleural effusion pericardial effusion enlargement of mediastinal andor hilar lymph nodes and cavitation were absent in the radiological findings of the patients also they reported that the most involved lobe was the left lower lobe 81 the left upper lobe and the right lower lobe were the same 76 and the involvement of the right middle lobe was less than the others 48 they further reported the cxr findings of five patients which had ct two cxr were normal despite the imaging abnormalities on their ct the remaining three cxrs demonstrated vague lung involvement while their respective cts had shown peripheral lesions yoon et al 2020 evaluated the imaging findings of cxr and ct of the nine covid19 korean patients their reports showed that the ct manifestations of covid19 pneumonia include bilateral and peripheral pure ggo sometimes mixed with occasional consolidations they also reported the obscure radiological findings on cxrs of the patients accordingly ct would be more sensitive for covid19 investigation compared with cxr therefore clinicians and radiologists need to become acquainted with the radiological findings of covid19 pneumonia based on ct images to control the outbreak of the disease successfullyadditionally we should consider that the imaging manifestation of the covid19 is similar to other viral pneumonia bacterial pneumonia and some other lesions sometimes there are challenges in differentiating covid19 from other underlying lung abnormalities by imaging manifestations alone so clinical symptoms laboratory screening tests and the contact history with confirmed patients accompanied by ct would result in the final diagnosis dai  zhang 2020 besides this from one report of the published literature highresolution ct has been suggested to differentiate covid19 lung involvement from other differential diagnoses l chen et al 2020 eventually the final diagnosis of the positive imaging findings on ct laboratory tests clinical symptoms should be verified by positive rtpcr or gene sequencing studies with regard to attention to the ct manifestations of the disease radiologists have a pivotal role in the early and rapid detection of suspected cases thus a chest ct scan is an accessible method that can create a quick imaging diagnosis in patients with clinical symptoms hence the chest ct scan should be performed as soon as possible to detect most covid19 patients at an early stage this would accelerate the isolation process of covid19 patients and also benefit the general populations health statefrom decades ago pooling diagnostic tests have been developed to optimize detection time save on reagents and quickly detect large numbers of suspicious or contaminated cases in infectious disease beneficially intricate equipment and additional training are not required in the use of these tests nguyen bish  aprahamian 2018 pooling has been evidenced for rtqpcr which would allow to rtpcr to detect the lowconcentration rna with further optimization arnold et al 2013 in this context yelin et al 2020 conducted a study to investigate the efficacy of standard rtqpcr in distinguishing a single positive sample within a pool of negative samples using five positive samples and 67 negative samples first they solely confirmed the rna positive samples then combined them with a large number of negative samples which were previously confirmed interestingly they could detect the positive samples in pools of up to 32 samples which could be detected in even up to 64 samples with extra pcr cycles a 10 falsenegative rate was estimated using this technique promisingly this diagnostic pooling test could be used in clinical testing laboratories for detecting the covid19 infected cases furthermore it can lead to broadening the screening capacities and community detection of suspicious or infected individualsdespite the benefits of the rrtpcr technique there are some limitations such as requiring expensive instruments trained experts long procedures high falsenegative results and importantly high risk of disease spread to solve these restrictions the jinzhao song research team proposed using an alternative rapid test with some advantages such as low cost easy usage high sensitivity and the possibility of use at home eltholoth bau  song 2020 in this study a novel closedtube covid19 assay pennramp comprised of a twostage isothermal double stranded dna amplification method was presented to amplify and detect the nucleic acid of the pathogen this diagnostic procedure was designed to simplify the detection of positive cases in a single tube reaction using both recombinase polymerase amplification rpa and loopmediated isothermal amplification lamp techniques in a single tubeit should be noted that there is a possibility of a positive rtpcr result in covid19 recovered patients with this point of view a study evaluated four treated covid19 patients from wuhan china by rrtpcr to confirm whether they could return to work the patients recovery was confirmed by rehabilitation criteria including normal temperature over 3 days relieved respiratory difficulties and confirmed ct imaging based on recovered acute exudative lesions finally confirmation of two separated negative rtpcr results led to hospital discharge and discontinuation of quarantine accordingly rtpcr assays were carried out on throat swabs of patients using biogerm kits 513 days after hospital discharge and discontinuation of quarantine all of which were positive lan et al 2020 surprisingly the results revealed that a proportion of rehabilitated patients can be virus carriers and should continue the quarantine protocol for about 5 days more also the rtpcr assay should be reevaluated to confirm the complete remission of treated patientsaccording to a report in one sarscov2 infected patient with both rtqpcr and ngs the positive results were not confirmedby rtqpcr testing within 3 weeks before obtaining the balf wang et al 2020 this data suggests the high fnr or inconsistency of rtpcr assays which significantly affects the efficacy of the detection of positives cases for example variation in viral rna sequences may affect the primers in the detection of the orf1b and n genes which leads to falsenegative results additionally various infection conditions in patients the natural history of the disease viral load alteration in different anatomic sites and diverse sampling processes with different accuraciesare the other reasons related to the high fnr urgent measures should be usedto optimize appropriate and accurate diagnostic tests as well as the standard operating procedure sop for example the recommendation of using the lower respiratory tract specimens sputum and balf and the nasopharyngeal swab would reduce the fnr y wang et al 2020 moreover paying more attention to related parameters ofthe rtpcr assay including sample reagents transportation and laboratory sop would decrease the high fnr for instance trisol is a key reagent that should be considered due to the application in protecting the stability of rna samples and inactivation of viruses as a suggestion according to previously published studies combinational diagnosis based on using the clinical features laboratory tests ct imaging rtpcr and ngs testing may be more beneficial foraccurate diagnosis of infected patientslaboratory screening tests laboratory findings based on assessing the biological and chemical factors in blood would be helpful for better determination of covid19 infected patients although they do not have higher specificity and sensitivity table 3 for this purpose the complete blood count as well as blood biochemistry measurement should be carried out for each patient according to published results the different common laboratory abnormalities which have been found in sarscov2 cases are as follows low count of white cells leukopenia lower than 1000 a low percentage of lymphocytes lymphopenia decreased level of albumin hypoalbuminemia increased levels of creactive protein crp and erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr c huang et al 2020 moreover there are elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase ast and alanine aminotransferase alt in infected patients due to the abnormal function of the liver increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase ldh and creatine phosphokinase cpk due to myocardial zymogram abnormality have been reported as well moreover a higher level of ddimer was also detected in patients with severe conditions bangash patel  parekh 2020 f zhou et al 2020 the procalcitonin level is mostly normal in covid19 patients but a higherlevel was reported in bacterial coinfectionincreased levels of pro and inflammatory cytokines in the serum of infected covid19 patients also were reported in several studies which is considered as the main reason for the cytokine storm c huang et al 2020 in addition to the laboratory findings as mentioned above detecting the lymphocyte subsets and their levels in the blood samples of patients would provide valuable information for better diagnosis of infection in a study wan et al 2020 indicated the reduced levels of tcell subsets the reduction rates of cd4 t cells were 5290 and 9524 in the mild and severe group of patients respectively moreover cd8 t cells were responsible for 2840 and 6190 reduction rates in the mild and severe groups respectively these data suggest that t lymphocytes were significantly reduced in covid19 infected patients also b cells indicated a 2549 and 2857 reduction ratio in the mild and severe groups respectively notably the limited activity of natural killer nk cells in infected cases was evidenced in the mild and severe group of patients with a 3431 and 4762 reduction ratio respectively furthermore evaluation of proinflammatory cytokines including tnf il1b il7 il8 il9 il10 mip1a mip1b mcp1 ip10 gmcsf interleukin1 receptor antagonist il1ra interferon granulocyte colonystimulating factor gcsf fibroblast growth factor fgf vascular endothelial growth factor plateletderived growth factor in plasma of icu and nonicu patients showed increased amounts compared with the healthy individuals moreover icu patients indicated greater levels of tnf ip10 mip1a mcp1 gcsf il2 il7 and il10 than nonicu patients the higher levels of the mentioned cytokines were correlated with the cytokine storm pulmonary inflammation and lung injuryin a systematic review and metaanalysis study pormohammad et al 2020 investigating the available laboratory data among 2361 sarscov2 patients the results demonstrated 133 leukocytosis 26 leukopenia and 625 lymphopenia furthermore among 2200 patients increased levels of platelets thrombocytosis and crp were reported in 91 and 81 of patients respectively also a case report study by w han et al 2020 reported the clinical diagnosis and alteration of clinical parameters in a 47yearold man infected by covid19 from wuweian the findings revealed an increased level of crp 84 mgl reduced levels of lymphocytes lymphopenia and a slight increase in neutrophil numbers fibrinogen and lactic dehydrogenase 230 ulanother systematic review and metaanalysis investigated the clinical laboratory and imaging features of covid19 patients in 18 studies accordingly the findings reported lymphopenia 431 higher levels of crp 583 and esr 418 a decreased level of albumin 758 and an increased level of ldh 57 rodriguezmorales et al 2020 y liu et al 2020 investigated the correlation between clinical and biochemical indexes and viral loads and lung injury in 12 2019ncov infected patients from shenzhen china the murray score is considered as an index of the severity of acute lung injury in ards a greater score indicates a higher severity in ards patients the study findings revealed the positive correlation between the crp and ldh levels with murray scores however a negative correlation was observed between the albumin and lymphocyte counts with murray scores on the basis of these results a significant relationship can be predicted between severe acute lung injury in covid19 patients and high levels of crp and ldh as well as decreased levels of albumin hypoalbuminemia lymphocyte counts lymphopenia and the percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils consequently despite the nonspecific findings of blood count and parameters in diagnosing covid19 infected patients these laboratory findings would be helpful in early detection of infected cases in combination with highly specific and sensitive approaches such as ct imaging and rtpcr assayfollowing the exposure to sarscov2 the host immune system releases the igm and igg antibodies against the virus first igm appears in the initial exposure to response to sarscov2 antigens and is involved in the primary immune responses however igg is also engaged in secondary immune responses igm is the first produced antibody with low concentration low affinity and limited maintenance time which is disappeared at the end of the infection contrarily igg is later secreted with high concentration affinity and maintenance time and also persists after infection recovery accordingly igm detection indicates acute infection and igg is a diagnostic index of previous middle or late infection thereby developing elisa tests for detecting these antisarscov2 antibodies would help early detection of positive cases at least a few weeks after infection onset interestingly a large number of suspected cases can be identified in a short time with simple facilities and acceptable sensitivityspecificity rates as well as a low rate of falsenegative resultsin one study w zhang et al 2020 investigated the dynamic alterations of viral presence in both oral and anal swabs derived from covid19 patients who received medical treatments for about 10 days they evaluated the presence of both viral antibody and viral nucleotide levels based on a previously established method both igm and igg in all 39 sarscov2 patients were detected 5 days after infection onset which was undetectable on day 0 as a result the positive rate of igm was enhanced from 50 to 81 and igg reached from 81 to 100xiang et al 2020 conducted the elisa test on 63 covid19 infected patients admitted to jinyintan hospital in wuhan hubei serum samples of patients were assessed by igm capture elisa and igg indirect elisa the study findings revealed that igm was positive in 28 of 63 samples with 643 accuracy 444 sensitivity and 100 specificity also the sample detection of 52 cases indicates a positive igg result with 8254 sensitivity 100 specificity and 888 accuracy moreover 873 sensitivity was obtained using the combinational detection of igm and igganother study by liu liu wang and zheng 2020 was performed to analyze the diagnostic values of igm and igg antibodies against the n protein of sarscov2 in 238 hospital admitted patients with confirmed or suspected sarscovid19 infection surprisingly the elisa findings indicated that suspected cases were positively contaminated by sarscov2 they also detected the igm and igg in 194 cases with a 815 positive rate which was considerably more than the rtpcr assay 643 additionally it was found that elisa detected suspected patients who had negative rtpcr results with a 788 positive rate for igm and iggw liu et al 2020 measured the produced igm and igg antibodies against nucleocapsid protein rn and spike protein rs of sarscov2 in 214 covid19 confirmed patients using the elisa successfully rnbased igm and igg were detected in 682 and 701 of patients respectively besides this rsbased igm and igg were discovered in 771 and 743 of patients respectively findings also reported that positive rates of igmigg were 804 and 822 for rn and rsbased detections respectively furthermore it was found that rsbased detection of igm had a higher sensitivity than rnbased detectionin an investigation by amanat et al 2020 elisa was developed using recombinant antigens originating from the spike protein sp of sarscov2 they showed that screening and identification of covid19 seroconverters were possible as early as 3 days following the symptom onset with high sensitivity and specificity as expected no reactivity was observed in individuals who were not exposed to sarscov2 and were completely naive for sp by reliance on these details exposedimmune and naive people can be easily distinguished in a related study by stadlbauer et al 2020 a detailed protocol was provided for the expression of antigens derived from the spike protein that can be used as a substrate for setting up elisa and other immunological assays they claimed that the presented protocol was adapted to local needs including research diagnostic and clinical laboratories with respect to the applications of elisa in detecting the antisarscov2 igmigg antibodies based on the findings mentioned above it is considered as an applicable serological assay for the detection of covid19 with high sensitivity and specificityin one study long et al 2020 designed a study to investigate the profile of the acute antibody responses through a crosssection analysis of 285 patients and a followup study of 63 patients they assessed the application of the antibody assay as a facilitated diagnostic approach to identify the covid19 infection in both suspicious and asymptomatic close contact cases a mclia kit was used to detect the antisarscov2 igm and igg in the plasma samples based on doubleantibodies sandwich immunoassay using an automated magnetic chemiluminescence analyzer accordingly 1719 days following the onset of symptoms the positive rate of igg was 100 whereas after 2022 days the igm had an around 941 positive rate they also found that the igm and igg titers were gradually increased within 3 weeks after onset of the symptoms however igm indicated a slight decrease after more than 3 weeks moreover it was understood that in patients with a severe condition igg and igm titers were more remarkable than those with the nonsevere condition on the basis of the crosssection analysis and the followup study the findings demonstrated that igg and igm seroconversion were detected in all covid19 confirmed cases 20 days after onset of the symptoms as a consequence they found that the elimination of sarscov2 infection could be confirmed due to the under detectable igm and igg in patients 20 days after symptom initiation and 23 days after exposureanother potent and useful diagnostic serologic immunoassay is the gica which is beneficial for the early detection of covid19 patients the gica technique is based on the specific antigenantibody immunoreactions which is completed within 30 min without requiring intricate equipment and procedures in this context xiang et al 2020 figured out the antisarscov2 igm and igg antibodies using the rapid gica kits in the serum samples of 91 patients results unraveled that igm and igg were positive in 52 and 74 patients respectively in detail 571 sensitivity 100 specificity and 69 accuracy were reported for the igm detecting test also 813 sensitivity 100 specificity and 865 accuracy was obtained for igg detection interestingly the combined detection of igm and igg accounted for 824 sensitivityin another investigation pan li et al 2020 applied the gica assay to detect the igm and igg in infected patients confirmed with rtpcr as a result igm and igg have a relatively low positive rate in the early stages of the disease but gradually increased within the disease progression accordingly the igm positive rate in the early middle and late stages of the disease was 111 786 and 742 respectively moreover the positive rate of igg in the early middle and late stages of the disease was 36 571 and 968 respectively noteworthily combined detection of igm and igg by gica demonstrated the 929 positive rate in the middle stage of the diseaseas for advantages the gica assay has shown high sensitivity particularly 7 days after infection onset in detecting patients with a negative nuclearacid diagnostic it is completed within 15 min without requiring specialist equipment and procedures the gica assay can be utilized with high adoption in areas with limited diagnostic capacity on the basis of this it is recommended to use the gica as a supplementary diagnostic approach it is known as a sensitive complementary and early detection assay despite the mentioned advantages gica provides only qualitative findingsthe lfa a qualitative immunoassay is another potent serological technology used to detect the covid19 infected cases with a rapid simple and lowcost procedure lfa acts based on a paperbased platform for quantifying multiple analytes in a sample within 530 min accordingly it can be employed to detect the presence or absence of the antisarscov2 igm and igg antibodies in blood samples of patients within 15 min simultaneously moreover due to good adoption lfa can be widely used in remote regions developing countries and small laboratories koczula  gallotta 2016 wang et al z li et al 2020 designed a study to detect the igm and igg antibodies in blood samples of 397 clinically positive and 128 clinically negative covid19 patients using the igmigg combined antibody test point of care lfa kit as a result they reported 8866 sensitivity and 9063 specificity for overall testing additionally they found that both igm and igg antibodies were positive in 6448 of patients however false positive and false negative results were also observed using this techniquenucleic acidbased molecular tests and antibody assays have been applied for detecting the sarscov2 infection however a viral antigen has not been developed to identify the infection viral antigens derived from virus proteins are known as specific indications of the virus which appear before the antibodies therefore diagnosing viral antigens would facilitate the rapid screening and diagnosis of infection to prevent virus outbreak and increase survival of patients to recognize the human coronaviruses diseases hcovs utilizing the rapid antigen tests provides an infection diagnosis by a short time low cost and simple equipment procedure unfortunately the low sensitivity of the antigen rapid test limits the broader usage which has been evidenced in the detection of the influenza viruses y chen et al 2016 sastre et al 2011 interestingly to enhance the efficacy of antigen rapid test to detect the sarscov2 and other respiratory viruses colloidal goldlabeled igg can be employed as a diagnostic elementaccording to a study conducted for an antigen rapid test the findings demonstrated the high sensitivity of detecting the n antigen derived from sarscov in the early stages of the infection which was a useful early diagnostic approach for sarscov che et al 2004 di et al 2005 in a prepeer reviewed study diao et al 2020 a cohort of 239 participants with suspected sarscov2 infection was included to detect the viral antigen accordingly the nucleocapsid protein np of sarscov2 was evaluated in nasopharyngeal swab and urine sample within 10 minutes using a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay in this method the nucleic acid test and the nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test were considered as the reference standards for detecting the np in nasopharyngeal swab and urine samples respectively as a result in 141 of 208 patients with positive covid19 nucleic acid results the n antigen was detected with 68 sensitivity likewise in 31 patients with negative nucleic acid tests the n protein was negative with 100 specificity the findings also revealed 72 accuracy total coincidence rate of this antigen rapid test in addition they found that 736 of patients were diagnosed through the detection of n protein in the urine samples consequently the results of this study indicated 94 and 78 sensitivity for n antigen detection in the first 5 days and 610 days after infection onset respectively as a consequence antigen rapid tests can be employed as early rapid accurate and simple diagnostic approaches for covid19 infectionimmunoassay techniques have been developed for the quantitative semiquantitative or qualitative detection of the analytes immunoassays have multiple functional aspects including clinical diagnosis environmental monitoring food testing and biopharmaceutical analysis the direct fluorescent antibody dfa test the microneutralization mn assay np detection assay immunofluorescence assay ifa semiconductor quantum dots qds and protein chip are some examples of immunoassays carried out to detect the concentration of the analytes based on antigenantibody reactions chan et al 2013 roh  jo 2011 accordingly immunoassays can detect related antigens or antibodies of coronavirus and determine the antigenantibody interactions despite the benefits of these simple and rapid immunoassay techniques low sensitivity and specificity have limited their usage however they can be applied as rapid and available diagnostic methods to assist in the early detection of covid19neutralizing antibodies nabs are vital immune factors produced against viral diseases which have principal roles in virus clearance protection and recovery of infected patients according to previously published results the detection of nabs is considered as a gold standard evaluation of antiviral vaccines against polio influenza and smallpox infections and plasma therapy in ebola influenza and sarscov infections van griensven et al 2016 wong dai wu  sung 2003 b zhou zhong  guan 2007 to develop vaccines or transfusion of convalescent plasma for prophylaxis or treating covid19 patients sarscov2specific nabs can be detected in the plasma of recovered patients using the pseudotypedlentiviralvectorbased neutralization assay a sensitive and reproducible test casadevall  pirofski 2020 in one study f wu et al 2020 measured the antisarscov2 nabs in the plasma of 175 adult covid19 recovered patients with common or mild conditions performing the pseudovirus neutralization assay to investigate the correlation between clinical features of infected patients and nabs levels as for results mediumlow id50 500999 mediumhigh id50 10002500 and high id50  2500 levels of nab titers were found in around 17 39 and 14 studied cases respectively however 30 of them have decreased levels of nab titers id50  500 and ten of them have nab titers below the limit of the detection id50  40 moreover they showed that there is a positive correlation between antisarscov2 nabs and crp level whereas no significant association was observed between nabs titers and lymphocyte count in older covid19 recovered patients consequently evaluating the nabs against sarscov2 would provide an understanding of whether they could protect the patients from disease progression and help develop the immunebased treatments like vaccines and plasma infusionaccording to the low viral load of the virus and the high falsenegative rate of the rtpcr results at the initial stages of the disease it is required to screen the suspected patients with ct images fang et al analyzed the sensitivity rate of covid19 lung involvement on chest ct and detection of the virus nucleic acid by rtpcr they reported that the sensitivity of the ct 98 is higher than rtpcr 71 p  001 the reasons for the low effectiveness of the rtpcr approach may be as follows inapplicable clinical sampling rudimentary improvement of nucleic acid detection by rtpcr differences in the detection rate of various companies and low viral load this study has supported the idea of using the chest ct in the early stages to screen suspected patients especially those who have negative rtpcr results fang et al 2020 xie et al 2020 followed five covid19 suspected patients with initial negative rtpcr test results the radiological findings on ct represented ggo andor consolidations they isolated the mentioned patients eventually repeated swab tests and ct scans led to the covid19 confirmed state so it was beneficial to examine the highly suspicious patients with repeated swab tests especially while they had initial negative rtpcr results ai et al 2020 compared the two ct and rtpcr methods in 1014 patients with clinical symptoms as a result 6011014 patients 59 had positive rtpcr results for covid19 and 8881014 patients 88 had positive imaging findings on ct their reports have demonstrated the higher sensitivity rate of ct diagnosis compares to initial rtpcr the serial analysis of rtpcr and ct scans proved that 6093 of the patients had serial positive imaging manifestations for covid19 on ct before the rtpcr tests became positive also the followup ct scans show a recovery process of 42 in the patients before the rtpcr results became negativeearly and accurate detection of positive infected cases is a critical issue in managing the spread of covid19 rtpcr assays are required for confirming the infection however considering the related limitations serological tests may lead to better diagnosis of positive cases for this reason detecting the serum specific antibodies of sarscov2 by elisa technique is recommended due to the capability of tracing immune responses against the virus short time procedure and requiring simple facilities serological tests have potent applications in early diagnosis of infection the advantages of serological assays based on antibody detection include less falsenegative results indicating past infections determining infection stage and estimating time since exposure this means that antibody tests can be used to determine whether a patient with no symptoms has previously had covid19 and could thus be immuneprotected to it as igm can be detected in 3 days after infection onset in most infections it confirms the advantage of early detection of the serological tests compared with rtpcr also the importance of specimen quality for the serological assays is less stringent compared with rtpcr assays importantly falsenegative results derived from sampling quality are fewer in using antibodies for serological diagnosis xiao wu  liu 2020 on the basis of this it has been suggested that using serological assays provides the facility of early diagnosis of positive cases even with an improper sample collection and unsatisfied molecular examinationsas another benefit a broad scale of infection diagnosis is achieved using the elisa technique that detects the antibodies by automatic devices moreover elisa provides the feasibility of identifying a large number of infected cases in a quick turnaround time the other limitations of rnabased assays that led to the critical necessity to use elisa include requiring upscale and expensive lab facilities restrictive biosafety levels low or middle detection sensitivity and specificity different sampling locations and technical experts another essential issue is the ease of using serological tests in the clinical laboratory of any hospital as opposed to the molecular approach that requires a specific and wellequipped laboratory notably reporting on the very mild or asymptomatically infected cases as a large population without viral rnabased testing is another critical aspect that should be considered hence detection of the specific igg antibody as a largescale seroepidemiological study would help understand the true scale of humantohuman transmission and report the accurate rate of covid19 infected cases xiao et al 2020currently encouragingly fda approved the rapid qualitative test for the detection of the antisarscov2 igm and igg antibodies in serum plasma and venipuncture whole blood specimens of covid19 suspected cases the cellex qsarscov2 iggigm rapid acts based on a lateral chromatographic flow immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection and differentiation of antisarscov2 igm and igg antibodies us food  drug administration 2020 promisingly these types of applicable diagnostic tests would contribute to the early detection of infected or suspected cases and prevent the spread of the virusrecently the new abbott id now covid19 test has received emergency use authorization eua from the fda to detect the novel coronavirus sarscov2 as the fastest available molecular pointofcare test the abbott id now test is identified as a rapid isothermal and instrumentbased system that can be used for the qualitative identification of infections interestingly this approach has a unique isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that provides molecular results in a short time which lets clinicians make evidencebased clinical decisions during a patient visit accordingly it has been reported that the abbott id now assay presents positive results in as few as 5 min and negative results within 13 min based on the rrtpcr assay moreover for the detection of influenza ab strep a and respiratory syncytial virus rsv id now is the pioneer molecular pointofcare platform abbott 2020with regardto the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019ncov worldwide arisen from wuhan china it is critically required to identifypractical strategies for precise diagnostic methods and appropriate treatment choices the rapid humantohuman transmission of sarscov2 even by asymptomatic carriers has led to an intensive health disaster the most common clinical manifestations of the disease are fever cough and dyspnea some complications such as ards acute kidney injury and liver damage may also occur during the process of the disease which can cause death subsequently additionally the elevated levels of pro and inflammatory cytokines elicit the cytokine storm phenomenon which has proved to be a prominent reason for respiratory system destructionthe typical laboratory abnormalities in covid19 patients include lymphopenia hypoalbuminemia and increased levels of crp esr ldh ast alt and ddimer although the characteristics of clinical features and abnormal laboratory finding results can guide healthcare workers toward a primary diagnosis the final detection of the covid19 patients is confirmed by spiral lung ct scans molecular assays and serological tests mostly bilateral and peripheral ggos andor occasional consolidations have been observed in radiological findings of lung involvements indisputably initial chest ct could be performed as a potential diagnostic modality in symptomatic cases especially at the early stages of the disease of note it should be considered that some suspected patients may have no ct findings therefore repeated ct imaging and other diagnostic techniques would assist in ruling out or confirming the suspected individuals the other applicable confirmation methods are rnabased molecular assays among which the rrtpcr test is a goldstandard approach despite the rapid and definite diagnosis of the infected cases highfnr lengthy procedure and the necessity of intricate equipment restricts the utilization of the rtpcr assays compared with ct imaging recently serological techniques have been developed as another quick diagnostic test based on detecting sarscov2specific igmigg antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity besides this it is worth noting that the accurate process of sample collection sampling clinical specimens from multiple sites and different detection rates of positive specimens should be considered to achieve the most accurate test results for covid19 diagnosis in conclusion the profound comprehension of various application aspects of the diagnostic approaches their advantages and disadvantages as well as their appropriate administration could lead to taking efficacious steps forward to prevent the virus outbreak manage the current pandemic state contribute to infected patients recovery and subsequently promote public

verifying the manuscript before submissionthe coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that may cause various symptoms such as pneumonia fever breathing difficulty and lung infection 1 these viruses are common in animals worldwide but very few cases have been known to affect humans the world health organization who used the term 2019 novel coronavirus to refer to a coronavirus that affected the lower respiratory tract of patients with pneumonia in wuhan china on 29 december 2019 24 the who announced that the official name of the 2019 novel coronavirus is coronavirus disease covid-19 4 and the current reference name for the virus is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 it was reported that a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a local huanan south china seafood market in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 5in response to the outbreak the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc dispatched a rapid response team to accompany health authorities of hubei province and wuhan city to conduct epidemiological and etiological investigations the who confirmed that the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic was associated with the huanan south china seafood marketplace but no specific animal association was identified 6 scientists immediately started to research the source of the new coronavirus and the first genome of covid-19 was published by the research team led by prof yong-zhen zhang on 10 january 2020 7 within 1 month this virus spread quickly throughout china during the chinese new year  a period when there is a high level of human mobility among chinese people although it is still too early to predict susceptible populations early patterns have shown a trend similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronaviruses susceptibility seems to be associated with age biological sex and other health conditions 8 covid-19 has now been declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the who 9given the spread of the new coronavirus and its impacts on human health the research community has responded rapidly to the new virus and many preliminary research articles have already been published about this epidemic additional file 1 we conducted a scoping review to summarize and critically analyze all the published scientific articles regarding the new coronavirus in january 2020 this review aims to provide the evidence of early findings on the epidemiology causes clinical diagnosis as well as prevention and control of covid-19 in relation to time location and source of publication this review can provide meaningful information for future research related to this topic and may support government decision-making on strategies to handle this public health emergency at the community national and international levelsa scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested

on 29 december 2019 the first four cases of an acute respiratory syndrome of unknown etiology were reported in wuhan city hubei province china among people linked to a local seafood market wet market 2 research is underway to understand more about transmissibility severity and other features associated with covid-19 3 it appears that most of the early cases had some sort of contact history with the original seafood market 2 1214 soon a secondary source of infection was found to be human-to-human transmission via close contact there was an increase of infected people with no history of exposure to wildlife or visiting wuhan and multiple cases of infection were detected among medical professionals 2 1417 it became clear that the covid-19 infection occurs through exposure to the virus and both the immunosuppressed and normal population appear susceptible some studies have reported an age distribution of adult patients between 25 and 89 years old most adult patients were between 35 and 55 years old 14 and there were fewer identified cases among children and infants 14 18 a study on early transmission dynamics of the virus reported the median age of patients to be 59 years ranging from 15 to 89 years with the majority 59 being male 2 it was suggested that the population most at risk may be people with poor immune function such as older people and those with renal and hepatic dysfunction 2the covid-19 has been found to have higher levels of transmissibility and pandemic risk than the sars-cov as the effective reproductive number r of covid-19 29 is estimated to be higher than the reported effective reproduction number r of sars 177 at this early stage 15 different studies of covid-19 have estimated the basic reproduction r0 range to be from 26 to 471 table 4 the average incubation duration of covid-19 was estimated to be 48  26 ranging from 2 to 11 days 15 and 52 days 95 confidence interval 41 to 7 2 the latest guidelines from chinese health authorities stated an average incubation duration of 7 days ranging from 2 to 14 days 23 table 4 summarizes the findings on important indicators from these epidemiological studies
in china 11 791 cases were confirmed and 17 988 cases were suspected in 34 provinces as of 2400 31 january 2020 fig 4 32 studies indicated that the spread of covid-19 was relatively quick and reported that it had spread to several other countries after its outbreak in china on 31 january 2020 there were 213 deaths reported globally 33 confirmed cases were reported in the following 19 countries outside of china australia 9 canada 3 cambodia 1 france 6 finland 1 germany 5 india 1 italy 2 japan 14 nepal 1 malaysia 8 the philippines 1 the republic of korea 11 singapore 13 sri lanka 1 thailand 14 the united states of america 6 united arab emirates 4 and vietnam 5 fig 5 33
coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded rna viruses that are zoonotic in nature and cause symptoms ranging from those similar to the common cold to more severe respiratory enteric hepatic and neurological symptoms 5 34 other than sars-cov-2 there are six known coronaviruses in humans hcov-229e hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 and mers-cov 2 23 35 36 coronavirus has caused two large-scale pandemics in the last two decades sars 37 and mers 12 38to detect the infection source of covid-19 china cdc researchers collected 585 environmental samples from the huanan seafood market in wuhan hubei province china on 1 january and 12 january 2020 they detected 33 samples containing sars-cov-2 and indicated that it originated from wild animals sold in the market 39 then researchers used the lung fluid blood and throat swab samples of 15 patients to conduct laboratory tests these laboratory tests found that the virus-specific nucleic acid sequences in the sample are different from those of known human coronavirus species laboratory results also indicated that sars-cov-2 is similar to some of the beta  coronaviruses genera identified in bats 12 18 40 which is situated in a group of sarssars-like cov 12to conduct next-generation sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates researchers enrolled nine inpatients in wuhan with viral pneumonia and negative in common respiratory pathogens the results of this next-generation sequencing indicated that sars-cov-2 was more distant from sars-cov with about 79 sequence identity and mers-cov with about 50 sequence identity than from two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses  bat-sl-covzc45 with 879 sequence identity and bat-sl-covzxc21 with 872 sequence identity 41 studies also reported that covid-19 s-protein supported strong interaction with human ace2 molecules despite the dissimilarity of its sequence with that of sars-cov 12 42many domestic and wild animals including camels cattle cats and bats may serve as hosts for coronaviruses 23 it is considered that generally animal coronaviruses do not spread among humans 3 however there are exceptions such as sars and mers which are mainly spread though close contact with infected people via respiratory droplets from cough or sneezing with regard to covid-19 early patients were reported to have some link to the huanan seafood market in wuhan china suggesting that these early infections were due to animal-to-person transmission however later cases were reported among medical staff and others with no history of exposure to that market or visiting wuhan which was taken as an indication of human-to-human transmission 2 4 1517the latest guidelines from chinese health authorities 23 43 described three main transmission routes for the covid-19 1 droplets transmission 2 contact transmission and 3 aerosol transmission droplets transmission was reported to occur when respiratory droplets as produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes are ingested or inhaled by individuals nearby in close proximity contact transmission may occur when a subject touches a surface or object contaminated with the virus and subsequently touch their mouth nose or eyes and aerosol transmission may occur when respiratory droplets mix into the air forming aerosols and may cause infection when inhaled high dose of aerosols into the lungs in a relatively closed environment 23 43 in addition to these three routes one study also indicated the digestive system as a potential transmission route for covid-19 infection since patients had abdominal discomfort and diarrhea symptoms researchers analyzed four datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of digestive systems and found that ace2 was highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon 44the complete clinical manifestation is not clear yet as the reported symptoms range from mild to severe with some cases even resulting in death 3 the most commonly reported symptoms are fever cough myalgia or fatigue pneumonia and complicated dyspnea whereas less common reported symptoms include headache diarrhea hemoptysis runny nose and phlegm-producing cough 3 16 patients with mild symptoms were reported to recover after 1 week while severe cases were reported to experience progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage from the virus which may lead to death 13 cases resulting in death were primarily middle-aged and elderly patients with pre-existing diseases tumor surgery cirrhosis hypertension coronary heart disease diabetes and parkinsons disease 13 case definition guidelines mention the following symptoms fever decrease in lymphocytes and white blood cells new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography and no improvement in symptoms after 3 days of antibiotics treatment 2for patients with suspected infection the following procedures have been suggested for diagnosis performing real-time fluorescence rt-pcr to detect the positive nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 in sputum throat swabs and secretions of the lower respiratory tract samples 13 14 43prevention and control strategies and methods are reported at three levels national level case-related population level and general population level at the national level the national health commission of the peoples republic of china issued the no1 announcement on 20 january 2020 which officially included the covid-19 into the management of class b legal infectious diseases and allowed for class a infectious disease preventive and control measures to be implemented 45 under this policy medical institutes can adopt isolation treatment and observation protocols to prevent and control the spread of the covid-19 on 22 january 2020 the national health commission published national guidelines for the prevention and control of covid-19 for medical institutes to prevent nosocomial infection 46 on 28 january 2020 the national health commission issued protocols for rapid prevention and control measures in order to effectively contain the spread of the epidemic through a big isolation and big disinfection policy during the chinese spring festival 47 national-level strategies have also been issued with targeted measures for rural areas issued on 28 january 2020 and the elderly population issued on 31 january 2020 48 49 several public health measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the covid-19 were introduced these include case isolation identification and follow-up of contacts environmental disinfection and use of personal protective equipment 50to date no specific antiviral treatment has been confirmed to be effective against covid-19 regarding patients infected with covid-19 it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care 3 16 there are six clinical trials registered in both the international clinical trials registry platform and the chinese clinical trial registry to evaluate the efficacy or safety of targeted medicine in the treatment or prognosis of covid-19 additional file 2 51 52 regarding infected patients with covid-19 it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care 3 16 studies have also explored the prevention of nosocomial infection and psychological health issues associated with covid-19 a series of measures have been suggested to reduce nosocomial infection including knowledge training for prevention and control isolation disinfection classified protections at different degrees in infection areas and protection of confirmed cases 18 50 53 concerning psychological health some suggested psychological intervention for confirmed cases suspected cases and medical staff 18 54for the general population at this moment there is no vaccine preventing covid-19 the best prevention is to avoid being exposed to the virus 55 airborne precautions and other protective measures have been discussed and proposed for prevention infection preventive and control ipc measures that may reduce the risk of exposure include the following use of face masks covering coughs and sneezes with tissues that are then safely disposed of or if no tissues are available use a flexed elbow to cover the cough or sneeze regular hand washing with soap or disinfection with hand sanitizer containing at least 60 alcohol if soap and water are not available avoidance of contact with infected people and maintaining an appropriate distance as much as possible and refraining from touching eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands 3the who also issued detailed guidelines on the use of face masks in the community during care at home and in the health care settings of covid-19 56 in this document health care workers are recommended to use particulate respirators such as those certified n95 or ffp2 when performing aerosol-generating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or confirmed cases according to this guideline individuals with respiratory symptoms are advised to use medical masks both in health care and home care settings properly following the infection prevention guidelines according to this guideline an individual without respiratory symptoms is not required to wear a medical mask when in public proper use and disposal of masks is important to avoid any increase in risk of transmission 56in addition to articles published in research journals the china cdc published a guideline to raise awareness of the prevention and control of covid-19 among the general population the key messages of the guideline include causes how to choose and wear face masks proper hand washing habits preventive measures at different locations eg at home on public transportation and in public space disinfection methods and medical observation at home 57 in addition to scientific knowledge on ways to handle the covid-19 outbreak the guideline also suggests ways to eliminate panic among the general population 57the review applied a systematic and rigorous search strategy to retrieve relevant articles according to the research objectives this research summarizes scientific foundations identifies literature gaps and suggests some evidence for future research directions on covid-19 which will provide information for research community policymakers and health professionals to adjust andor come up with new research policies and practices our study only focuses on the articles published either in english or in chinese during the early outbreak period although it cannot reflect the entire body of research on covid-19 worldwide it will provide some evidences for future study and controlthis study shows a holistic picture of the current research in response to the outbreak of covid-19 during this early period many studies have been published exploring the epidemiology causes clinical manifestation and diagnosis and prevention and control of the novel coronavirus thus far most studies have focused on the epidemiology and potential causes however studies exploring prevention and control measures have begun to gradually increase studies in this domain are urgently needed to minimize the impact of the outbreak government agencies have quickly incorporated recent scientific findings into public policies at the community regional and national levels to slow down andor prevent the further spread of the covid-19 we recommend that the scholarly community conduct further research to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short-term and long-termnovel coronavirus pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan hubei province in early december 2019 1 and then quickly spread throughout china and subsequently throughout the entire world evolving into a pandemic and threatening global health this novel coronavirus along with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov belong to -coronavirus 2b lineage 2 although sars-cov-2 is indeed a distinct entity the similarities in genetic sequence share 70 and 40 with sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 3 this fact may partly explain why sars-cov-2 shares some common epidemiologic and clinical features with the 2 other viruses previous research has shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the functional receptor of sars-cov and is critical to the cellular entry of sars-cov 4 several studies also confirm that sars-cov-2 also leverages the ace2 receptor to gain entry into target cells 57 in addition ace2 is widely distributed in various human organs including the oral and nasal mucosa nasopharynx lung small intestine colon kidney spleen liver and brain moreover it is reported that ace2 expression is approximately 100-fold higher in the gastrointestinal tract particularly the colon than in the respiratory system 89 therefore it is not surprising that the digestive system with several ace2-expressing organs would present a risk for being invaded by sars-cov-2 10 although covid-19 is predominantly characterized by respiratory symptoms including fever cough and dyspnea 11 digestive symptoms are also reported among a clinically important subset of covid-19 patients often with concurrently elevated liver enzymes 21214 in some instances digestive symptoms are reported as the initial presentation of covid-19 15 these findings suggest that the virus can impair the digestive system and may explain the range of digestive symptoms seen in covid-19 including diarrhea nausea vomiting and diminished appetite 16 exploring the pathogenic mechanisms of covid-19 in the digestive system holds potential to improve prevention diagnosis and treatment for these patientsdigestive symptoms were reported among covid-19 patients in the initial outbreak in wuhan china in a descriptive cross-sectional multicenter study including 204 covid-19 patients confirmed by laboratory tests 416 of covid-19 patients suffered nausea or vomiting and 172 of covid-19 patients presented with diarrhea 17 importantly patients with severe disease were found with a higher incidence of diarrhea nausea or vomiting than those with nonsevere disease 12 the fact that digestive symptoms are closely associated with covid-19 condition severity was also proved by another single-center study from 1 hospital in wuhan 2 among the overall population diarrhea nausea vomiting abdominal pain and anorexia appeared in patients admitted into the intensive care unit icu more prominently than in those not transferred into the icu and the occurrence of anorexia between the 2 groups was increased with statistical significance which may present a good indicator for severe condition 2the intestinal damage caused by sars-cov-2 infection has been verified by autopsy and biopsy a recent report described the intestinal autopsy from a covid-19 patient who developed alternating segmental dilatation and stenosis of the small intestine 18 xiao et al 19 also performed gastrointestinal endoscopy for a confirmed covid-19 patient damage to the mucosa was observed in the esophagus and numerous plasma cells and lymphocytes were found to have infiltrated the lamina propria of the stomach duodenum and rectum by histological examination furthermore viral nucleocapsid protein was also detected in the cytoplasm of these sites it is noteworthy that approximately 3 of covid-19 cases exhibited only digestive symptoms without respiratory symptoms 17 acute hemorrhagic colitis could even occur in a covid-19 patient with digestive discomforts as the primary symptoms 20 thus more attention should be given to patients who present to the hospital with digestive symptoms especially those with a history of an epidemiological exposurethe positive detection of sars-cov-2 in the stool was a breakthrough which suggested that the virus can replicate and exist in the digestive tract 21 the fact that the digestive system could be infected by sars-cov-2 is further illustrated by guan et al 22 who reported that sars-cov-2 rna was detected in 4 of 62 65 stool specimens and 4 rectal swabs were positive for sars-cov-2 rna in addition the percentage of positive stool samples has been reported up to 5342 among hospitalized patients confirmed with covid-19 19 in another study detecting sars-cov-2 rna of different clinical specimens 44 of 153 29 stool samples were positive 23 of particular note the stool test positivity is higher in those with diarrhea 73 than those with only respiratory symptoms 14 16 the situation is further complicated by the findings that some covid-19 patients still present with nucleic acidpositive stool after the virus in pharyngeal swab turns negative 2425 consistent with this sars-cov-2 rna was detected in stool specimens in the first american covid-19 patients although serum specimens were repeatedly negative 21 moreover on average there are 11 days of sars-cov-2 shedding from feces after respiratory symptoms subside 26 thus it is reasonable that a standard of care for covid-19 patients leaving the hospital include fecal viral examination because of its delayed elimination at present whether the live sars-cov-2 virus could be detected in the stool is the focus of researches for its clinical value for fecaloral spread and infectivity wolfel et al 27 analyzed the virology of 9 covid-19 patients with mild symptoms although failed to isolate the live sars-cov-2 from the stool this negative result may be related to the subjects with mild symptoms the limited number of stool specimens and the tests only for the live virus on 612 days and in 4 patients in addition the absence of data on early time points in this study may cause the missing of a critical window of stool infectivity in the early stages however the study from the research teams of prof zhong at the state key laboratory of respiratory disease in china demonstrated that the live sars-cov-2 dose exist in the stool 28 thus the existence of live sars-cov-2 virus in the stool is vital to define the fecaloral spread of covid-19 and this finding is helpful to the development of public health strategies during fighting against covid-19it has also been reported that sars-cov-2 infection can lead to liver injury and abnormal liver function and liver enzymes are positively associated with covid-19 severity compared with nonsevere covid-19 patients severe covid-19 patients have higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin tbl 12 elevated hepatic enzymes are also more likely to be found in covid-19 patients treated in the icu than those not treated in the icu 2 in the first covid-19 confirmed case in the united states there was an overall upward trend of hepatic enzymes during his treatment which suggested that sars-cov-2 infection can directly affect the liver 21 the acute hepatitis caused by covid-19 infection has been reported recently and the severe liver damage could be presented before the typical symptoms of covid-19 which resulted in misdiagnosis in the early stage 29 it is worth noting that the elevated prothrombin time among the covid-19 patients with digestive symptoms is more common than that in those only with respiratory symptoms 17 hence close monitoring of liver function and liver enzymes should be early implemented in covid-19 patients with digestive symptoms furthermore 23 of 1099 covid-19 patients 21 have been diagnosed with hepatitis b coinfection although the proportions of patients with coincident abnormal liver enzymes and increased tbl reach to more than 20 and 10 respectively 12 in another study digestive system disease was present in 11 of covid-19 patients  but 43 of patients suffered with varying degrees of liver enzyme abnormality and 18 of patients suffered with increased tbl 30 such drastic differences cannot only be ascribed to the coexisting illness and conversely to some extent suggest that the pathogenic mechanism of sars-cov-2 may result in liver injury liver injury associated with covid-19 infection has also been revealed through autopsy and biopsy gross examination of the liver reveals it to be gray 18 and the pathological features of covid-19 hepatic injury include mild lobular and portal inflammation and moderate microvascular steatosis 31 thus the liver is indeed damaged during covid-19 infection so it is vital to closely and actively monitor liver function in covid-19 patientsin conclusion the digestive tract may serve as an infection route for covid-19 based on clinical and pathological evidence we should place more value on the reported digestive symptoms in infected patients monitor liver enzymes among those infected with the virus and consider screening for sars-cov-2 in fecal samples both to establish the diagnosis and to monitor for viral clearancethe high expression of ace2 in the intestinal tract makes the small bowel and colon highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection 10 currently this hypothesis was supported in a covid-19 patient via a bioinformatic analysis based on single-cell transcriptomes to identify the distribution of ace2-expressing cells a recent study demonstrated that ace2 expression was more frequently observed in the ileum and colon than in the lung and was mainly expressed in the absorptive enterocytes of the ileum and colon which offers a potential explanation for diarrhea observed in many covid-19 patients 9 moreover this study also revealed that ace2 is found in the stratified epithelial cells of the esophagus which may be helpful to explain the esophagitis caused by covid-19 9 the expression of ace2 messenger rna and protein in the gut is 100 times than that in the lung shown by the human protein atlas database 32 this database is a large transcriptome and proteome database based on rna sequencing analysis and immunohistochemical analysis and is used to analyze the differential expression of proteins in normal tissues and tumor tissues 33 the mechanisms of esophageal damage in covid-19 warrant further study and the reported differences for ace2 distribution may be related to the various detection techniquesanother proposed molecular explanation of covid-19 intestinal pathogenesis is that sars-cov-2 may interfere with the absorption of tryptophan because this process requires intestinal ace2 to regulate the expression of neutral amino acid transporters in ace2-deficient mice the colon was highly susceptible to develop inflammation and colitis after treatment with chemical irritants strikingly such experimentally induced colitis could be reversed by administering glycine tryptophan dipeptide a unique amino acid that can be taken up by another amino acid transporter proton-coupled peptide transporter pept1 however this same effect did not occur when treated jointly with an mtor inhibitor moreover the mtor inhibitor significantly downregulated antimicrobial peptide expression markedly altered the ileocecal gut microbiome and resulted in intestinal inflammation a similar intestinal inflammatory phenotype was observed in wild-type mice after transplantation with the ileocecal gut microbiota from ace2 mutant mice 34 thus intestinal sars-cov-2 may influence tryptophan absorption via ace2 resulting in decreased antimicrobial peptide and consequently altering gut microbiota to confer intestinal inflammation although this mechanism has not yet been demonstrated in humans intestinal microbial dysbiosis has indeed been identified in some covid-19 patients such as decreased lactobacillus and bifidobacterium 35 and the importance of treatment with probiotics for covid-19 has also been emphasized in the guidance given from chinas national health commission version 6 more basic and clinical researches should be focused on the relationships between intestinal microbiota and covid-19 in future studiesthe concept of the cytokine storm has been emphasized since the covid-19 outbreak which is associated with a systemic inflammatory reaction and multiple organ dysfunction including the digestive damage cytokine dysregulation and abnormal immune responses will lead to more severe disease and death higher expression of t-helper-1-related cytokines was noticed in the serum of covid-19 patients including interferon- ifn- t-helper-1 chemokine ifn--inducible protein-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 interleukin il il-6 and human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor concentrations of these cytokines were also significantly different between patients in the icu and those in non-icu however increased levels of t-helper-2-related anti-inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 were also found whose mechanistic roles remain to be elucidated 1 activated t cells in the peripheral blood obtained from a patient with covid-19 manifested high cytotoxicity with more cytotoxic granules granulysin and perforin suggesting that pathogenic t cells are associated with accelerating the systemic inflammation in this disease 31 moreover deteriorating intestinal inflammation was observed in mice during intragastric gavage with mers-cov importantly lung infection was then verified in these mice at day 5 after intragastric mers-cov inoculation and histological examination of the lung revealed inflammatory cell infiltration and viral antigen-positive cells indicating the possibility that pulmonary infection can be secondary to a primary mers-cov infection in the intestine through hematogenous viral trafficking 36 however whether intestinal lesions of covid-19 are the result of a secondary response after systemic inflammation are the result of a primary intestinal infection or are the combined results of both mechanisms remains uncertain further investigations of intestinal specimens from biopsy and autopsy are required to explore this mechanism dynamic monitoring of lymphocytes and cytokines can help achieve early detection early diagnosis and early treatment for covid-19 monoclonal antibodies targeting the excessive release of inflammatory cytokines may be promising for covid-19 treatmentace2 presumably plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of liver damage in covid-19 ace2 is an ace homologue that has the ability to counteract the vasoconstricting effect of angiotensin ang ii through degrading ang ii into ang 17 thereby decreasing damage to the liver caused by the reninangiotensin system 37 ace2 was identified with moderate expression in healthy livers in the previous study 38 but a recent single-cell rna sequencing study of healthy liver tissues found that ace2 was highly expressed in both cholangiocytes and hepatocytes particularly in more than half of cholangiocytes providing a new theoretical basis for liver injury in covid-19 infection 39 moreover the pathologic examination from a covid-19 death case found moderate microvascular fatty degeneration and mild hepatic lobular portal region active inflammation in the liver 31 suggesting that liver damage in covid-19 tends to be due to a secondary injury from hypoxia an in vitro experiment also showed that the expression and activity of ace2 were sharply increased in hepatocytes and bile duct cells under hypoxia 37 in general the condition of patients with coexisting liver disease may be potentially worsened during covid-19 infection from the increased expression of ace2 caused by hypoxia during the cytokine storm thus more attention should be given to these patients in clinical practice choosing appropriate liver medications to protect liver function for covid-19 patients is necessarydrug toxicity has served as 1 mechanism for covid-19-associated liver injury which also indicates that liver damage is secondary some drugs used in covid-19 patients have different degrees of liver function damage including traditional chinese medicine antipyretics and antiviral drugs in a severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated report 7 of 41 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome treated with kaletra experienced liver dysfunction and 1 patient had severe liver dysfunction and therefore had to discontinue antiviral treatment 40 in a singapore study 3 of 5 covid-19 patients treated with lopinavirritonavir developed liver function disturbance 41 however little is known about the incidence of hepatotoxicity of various drugs used in covid-19 more efforts should be made toward future studies regarding this concern which will be important for developing a reasonable intervention and reducing the harmful effects of drug-induced hepatotoxicity for patientsdigestive symptoms should be treated with caution in the early stage of covid-19 and dynamic monitoring of liver function and cytokines is imperative during clinical practice to reduce the complications and mortality of covid-19 ace2 and abnormal immune reactions could be targets in future studies to treat covid-19 moreover the detection of sars-cov-2 in fecal samples is essential for clinical practice particularly for patients with atypical symptoms and should be performed when covid-19 patients are leaving the hospital as well to confirm viral clearance the relationship between the digestive system and covid-19 deserves to be further explored in future related studiesguarantor of the article hu zhang md phdspecific author contributions hz researched data and outlined the article cxm

declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of intereston december 31 2019 the health commission of hubei province china first declared a cluster of unexplainable cases of pneumonia 1 subsequently on january 10 2020 the world health organization who announced that there was an outbreak of pneumonia of undiscovered cause in the city of wuhan hubei province china with an epidemiological association to the huanan seafood wholesale market where birds bats snakes and other wildlife animals are sold 2 a previously unknown coronavirus cov was immediately discovered in the specimens from the patients which who provisionally named as the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov later on february 11 2020 who officially announced that the novel coronavirus was renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome cov 2 sars-cov-2 and named the disease caused by sars-cov-2 as covid-19 that stands for the cov disease 2019since december 31 2019 and as of march 19 2020-600 pm gmt overall 81238 laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 and 3250 deaths were announced in all over china especially in wuhan hubei province fig 1 3 most of the fatal cases had typical symptoms such as fever dry cough dyspnoea and radiological findings of bilateral lung infiltrates several days after the start of the initial symptoms 4 subsequent etiological studies showed that the patients were infected with sars-cov-2 4 this is the first report that sars-cov-2 can infect humans in addition sars-cov-2 displays strong ability of human-to-human transmission worldwide although it currently has low pathogenicity covid-19 may lead to human death 1 as a result it raises global public health concerns about its risks and pandemic potentialin december 2019 wuhan in chinas hubei province became the epicenter of an unexplained outbreak of pneumonia drawing widespread attention not only in china but also in other countries 5 as of march 19 2020 81238 laboratory-confirmed human cases in china 131320 confirmed cases in 153 countries and other 696 confirmed cases on an international conveyance in japan have been reported to who table 1 3 confirmed cases of wuhan passengers were announced in thailand on january 13 in japan on january 15 and in south korea on january 19 and so on 6 it was soon found that sars-cov-2 caused covid-19 and was epidemiologically related to the huanan seafood market in wuhan 7 where restaurants supply wild animals suggesting that the main route of sars-cov-2 transmission may be the point-source zoonotic animal-to-human route 8 according to the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia program of covid-19 the main source of infection after the initial transmission to patients was sars-cov-2 infection in patients 8 recent studies suggest that sars-cov-2 may be transmitted from person to person primarily through respiratory droplets and through contact 9-11 compared to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 in wuhan currently appears to be less pathogenic and safe if we assumed that the virus spreads effectively worldwide 12 still the possibility of sars-cov-2 mutation cannot be ruled out 13 the incubation period of sars-cov-2 is about 7 days on average the short one is 2-3 days and the long one could be over 21 days 4 14 referring to the incubation period for other covs the sars-cov-2 case was placed under close contact medical observation for 14 days and close contacts were placed under medical observation in the hospital after 14 days if there is no evidence of the disease the person can be determined as not infected 4 14 everybody is susceptible to sars-cov-2 and disease in immunocompromised individuals progress relatively faster and more severe 2 14 children have less exposure and a lower risk of infection in the same way the elderly patients with chronic diseases and people with weak immunity are more likely to be infected 4 14sars-cov-2 belongs to the new coronavirus species in the genus containing sars-cov and mers-cov 15 it is enveloped and the particles are round or elliptic usually pleomorphic with a diameter of 60140 nm 16 17 its genetic characteristics are different from those of sars-cov and mers-cov 18 current studies have shown that sars-like coronavirus in bat bat-sl-covzc45 mg7729331 has over 85 homology to sars-cov-2 16 sars-cov-2 can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells at around 96 hours after infection 14 16 in contrast it takes about 6 days to isolate the viruses when vero e6 and huh-7 cell lines are used in the in-vitro culture system 14 16 covs are single-stranded rna viruses that mutate readily making it challenging to develop sustained immunity to them 19 flu viruses for example circulate every year and require the latest vaccine because the virus type often changes 20the circulating cov is a newly discovered cov named sars-cov-2 by who people are susceptible to the virus because they lack immunity to new strains of cov 2 14 sars-cov-2 is different from any of the six known covs that can infect humans including hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 hcov-nl63 sars-cov and mers-cov it is the seventh cov that can infect humans and cause severe pneumonia genomic analysis of sars-cov-2 showed that it was markedly different from both sars-cov and mers-cov with the genomic difference being 21 and 482 respectively 21 despite being a -cov sars-cov-2 is not the same as the sars-cov and mers-cov and is considered to be a distant relative of sars-cov rather than a variant of sars-cov or a resurgence of sars-cov 21 previous studies showed that two complete virus genomes hku-sz-002a and hku-sz-005b were sequenced using nanopore technology and revealed a sars-cov-2 is most closely related to bat sars-like covs bat-sl-covzxc21 ncbi registration number mg772934 and bat-sl-covzc45 ncbi registration number mg772933 1 which belong to the betacoronavirus genus fig 2 the virus genome sizes of hku-sz-002a and hku-sz-005b were about 298 kbp and the gc contents were 38 the difference between hku-sz-002a and hku-sz-005b was only two bases 1 one of them is a non-synonymous mutation at the amino acid position of the unstructured protein at 336 ser336 for hku-sz-002a leu336 for hku-sz-005b 1 approximately 66 of the amino acid residues of the n-terminal domain of spike subunit 1 of sars-cov-2 are identical to that of the sars-related cov the core region of the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain is approximately 68 similar to the virus at the amino acid level it has the same acidity as that of the sars-related cov the amino acid sequences in the outer subdomain of the spike subunit 1 receptor binding domain show only 39 identity which may influence the selection of human receptors and thus the biological behavior of the virus 1according to its genetic characteristics the cov family consists of four genera including alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus
22 of all rna viruses the cov rna genome ranging from 26 to 32 kbp is the largest one 23 sars-cov and mers-cov are classified into the betacoronavirus genus and are zoonotic pathogens that can cause critical respiratory infections in humans 24 the sars-cov-2 genomic structure belongs to that of -cov mn908947 25 in the previous study in early 2020 samples were collected from seven patients with severe pneumonia who had been exposed to sars-cov-2 at a seafood market in wuhan and were placed in an intensive care unit at the onset of the outbreak the samples were then sent to the wiv laboratory for pathogen diagnosis 26 they observed five positive bands on pcr a sample from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf wiv04 was analyzed using the next generation sequenced ngs to identify possible pathogens of the 1582 total readings obtained after filtering through 64 human genomes 1378 871 matched sars-cov sequences 26 the sars-cov-2 was named because the novel coronavirus has a 795 sequence identity with sars-cov bj01 genbank accession number ay2784882 26 the full-length genome sequences of four sars-cov-2 wiv02 wiv05 wiv06 and wiv07 gisaid accession numbers epiisl402127-402130 were subsequently obtained from four other patients with more than 999 homology being observed among them 26 the viral genome consists of six main open reading frames orfs as well as many other accessory genes 26 additional analysis showed that the sars-cov-2 genome had less than 80 nucleotide sequence identity with the sars-cov sequence they obtained a short rdrp region from a bat cov known as ratg13 that was previously found in rhinolophus affinis in yunnan province china with a high degree of sequence identity with sars-cov-2 26 physicochemical parameters of sars-cov-2 sequence id mn9089473 including isoelectric point instability index estimated half-life and grand average of hydropathicity gravy were investigated using the protparam tool of expasy 27 analysis of physicochemical parameters showed that the sars-cov-2 polypeptide is 9194 amino acids with a molecular weight of 106957759 dalton theoretical pi 902 the estimated half-life is 20 hours mammalian reticulocytes in vitro 30 min yeast in vivo and 10 hours escherichia coli in vivo and a gravy score of -0087 gravy categorizing the protein as unstable table 2angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that has been shown to play a critical role in the cardiovascular and immune systems through two different important physiological mechanisms ace2 catalyzes the production of vasodilatory peptides including angiotensin 1 to 7 28 since its discovery in 2000 ace2 has been extensively studied in the cardiovascular and metabolic fields suggesting that it plays a critical role in the development of cardiac function hypertension and diabetes in addition it is noteworthy that ace2 is a functional receptor for coronaviruses such as sars-cov and sars infection is caused by the binding of the sars-cov protein trimer to the hydrophobic pockets of ace2s extracellular catalytic domain 29 this interaction enables endocytosis membrane fusion and sars-cov entry into host cells when the virus entered ace2 protein was downregulated leading to a localized increase in angiotensin ii levels which provided a molecular explanation for the continual development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards during sars-cov infection ace2 is highly expressed in both heart and lung tissues therefore in addition to lowering blood pressure and improving heart function ace2 inhibitors are expected to prevent ace2sars-cov protein interaction and inhibit sars-cov infection 29 the spike s protein of sars-cov-2 contains a sars-cov-like receptor binding domain suggesting that its receptor should be ace2 which is the same as one for sars-cov recently it has been found that the expression level of ace2 in asian people is significantly higher than that in european and american people and that in men is higher than that in women 30-32 this difference also explains the high incidence of new coronary pneumonia in asia where there are more men than women 30-32 the sara-cov-2 primarily invades alveolar epithelial cells and interacts with ace2 leading to respiratory symptoms in patients 33 when patients complicated with underlying cardiovascular diseases the symptoms tended to be severe which may be related to increased renin secretion in these patients and increased ace2 secretion through negative feedback regulation providing more binding sites for sara-cov-2 34the common symptoms of covid-19 are fever 917 fatigue 750 cough 750 progressive dyspnea 367 gastrointestinal symptoms 396 and some patients  10 start with mild symptoms or even no palpable fever fig 3 35 from the current case situation most patients have a good prognosis a few patients are in critical conditions or even died 36 in addition to the above symptoms there may be atypical symptoms such as a only the symptoms of the digestive system as the first manifestation such as mild tolerance weakness general mental disorder nausea and vomiting diarrhea etc b neurological symptoms as the first manifestation such as headache c cardiovascular symptoms as the first manifestation such as palpitation chest tightness etc d ophthalmic symptoms as the first manifestation such as conjunctivitis e only mild muscle soreness in limbs or lower back 4many respiratory diseases are characterized by fever fatigue dry cough and other symptoms diagnosis of covid-19 requires a physician to make a comprehensive judgment based on whether heshe has been to an endemic area before the onset of the disease whether heshe has been exposed to suspected or confirmed cases and the results of laboratory tests 14 a dry cough is one of the symptoms of covid-19 the main difference between a dry cough and a cough is the presence of sputum 4 14 a dry cough is a cough in which there is no sputum or very little sputum common cold acute bronchitis inhalation of some irritant gas and dust and so on can also cause a dry cough pneumonia may be accompanied but early pneumonia may not be fever only chills and respiratory infection symptoms but computed tomography ct scan will show pneumonia in severe cases dyspnea and hypoxemia usually occur 1 week after infection 4 37 in severe cases it rapidly progressed to ards septic shock metabolic acidosis that was difficult to treat and bleeding and coagulation dysfunction 4 36 37 it is worth noting that patients with severe or critical illness may have a moderate or low fever or even no palpable fever 4 patients with mild cases showed only low fever mild fatigue and no pneumonia usually recovered after 1 week 4 a few infected patients exhibited no obvious clinical symptoms and only tested positive 4 from the current case situation most of the patients have a good prognosis the child cases are relatively mild and a few patients are in critical condition 14 deaths are more common in the elderly and those with chronic underlying diseases 14 of the 1023 deaths fatality rate 23 most were aged  60 years or had comorbidities such as hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes 38 laboratory examination showed that the total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased the lymphatic size was reduced and the cell count decreased liver enzymes muscle enzymes and myoglobin increased in some patients most patients c-reactive protein crp and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated and procalcitonin pct was normal normal or slightly higher levels of cytokines inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins-2 il-2 tumor necrosis factor- tnf-  il-6 interferon- ifn- and so on can be markedly increased in patients with organ failure in severe cases d-d dimer increased and lymphocytes progressively decreased 4 36 37on january 28 2020 the fourth edition of the pneumonia diagnostic guidelines for covid-19 was officially released and the pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 was characterized by human-to-human transmission 39 according to the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program for covid-19 trial version 4 suspected cases can be defined as 1 epidemiological history travel history or residence history in wuhan within two weeks before the onset of the disease or had been in contact with patients with fever and respiratory symptoms from wuhan within 14 days before the onset or had aggregated onset 2 clinical manifestations fever a with typical pneumonia imaging characteristics b the total number of early-onset white blood cells normal or decreased or lymphocyte count decreased real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr rt-pcr tested confirmed cases based on meeting the criteria for suspected cases sputum pharynx swabs lower respiratory tract secretions and other specimens for positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid or viral gene sequencing highly homologous to sars-cov-2 39 as one of the methods for early diagnosis of suspected cases chest imaging is widely used in a clinic because of its convenience and versatility 14 it is easy to diagnose multiple ground glass density shadows in typical bilateral lungs 14 40 however covid-19 caused by sars-coa-2 has not been thoroughly analyzed clinical features have not been described collectively 14 41in the early stage of the disease it was mainly manifested as scattered small flakes in the lung and focal ground-glass density and consolidation shadows distributed under the pleura or along the bronchial tree 14 in the progressive stage most of the patients reached the scene of the most severe lung infiltration within 8-14 days after the onset and the ground glass density shadows could be fused into scattered and multiple consolidation shadows in which air bronchi signs could be seen 4 when compared to sars in 2003 the main manifestations of covid-19 are fever is evident at the initial stage 2-3 days after onset and the imaging manifestations are usually small lamina in the lung a ground-glass shadow is common 4 14 the distribution of the following lung and surrounding areas is universal 4 14 progressive exacerbation occurs within 5-8 days after the onset of the disease and the most severe symptoms appear 2-3 weeks after onset which is called a progressive stage 42 ground glass shadow consolidation and mesh shadow appear followed by interlobular septum thickening 42 small patchy lesions develop to large patchy ones with single progression to multiple or diffuse lesions the development is swift and the change is rapid 14 the number of affected pulmonary lobes is increased rapidly and pathological changes can progress from a lung to several lobes from one lung to two lungs even white lung appears 14 two to three weeks after the onset of the disease it enters the absorption phase and changes from multiple and diffuse lesions to the limitation 14 the density begins to decrease and the range gradually shrinks or even disappears after inflammatory absorption some patients leave behind some manifestations of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis 4 14 this new type of viral pneumonia is fierce and the characteristics of human-to-human transmission have been identified chinas national microbiology data center shared the image 43 44 fig 4 early detection early report early isolation and early treatment is critical 45 the recognition of atypical imaging manifestations plays a vital role in the early identification of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 45 it is recommended to timely conduct multiple examinations and follow up with imaging to quickly and appropriately perform the diagnosis and observe the changes in the disease 45principles of treatment for suspected and confirmed cases should be isolated in designated hospitals with sufficient isolation conditions and protective conditions 14 suspected cases should be treated in isolation while confirmed cases can be admitted to the same ward critical cases should be admitted to the icu as soon as possible 14 bed rest vital signs heart rate pulse oxygen saturation respiratory rate and blood pressure should be observed supportive treatment should be strengthened to ensure adequate heat to maintain a stable internal environment such as water electrolyte and acid-base balance 14 complete blood count c-reactive protein crp procalcitonin pct and dirt were monitored according to the conditions of organ functions liver enzyme bilirubin myocardial enzyme creatinine urea nitrogen urine volume etc coagulation function arterial blood gas analysis and chest imaging 4 effective oxygen therapy including a nasal catheter mask oxygen high flow oxygen therapy hfno and non-invasive mechanical ventilation niv or invasive mechanical ventilation is recommended 14 extracorporeal oxygenation ecmo should be considered for refractory hypoxemia that is difficult to manage after protective pulmonary ventilation 4there is no evidence from a randomized controlled trial rct to support specific anti-sars-cov-2 drugs for suspected or confirmed cases up to now in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers infections some studies such as retrospective cohort studies historical control studies case reports or serial case reports confirmed that lopinavirritonavir or in combination with antivirals has some therapeutic advantages such as reducing the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards mortality 46-48 previous published systematic reviews show that lopinavirritonavir is primarily effective in early application and can reduce mortality and glucocorticoid dosage 49 50 if the early treatment window is missed however the late application has no significant effect we still need to carry out real-world clinical studies to further explore the clinical implications of their early use in the covid-19 14 the effectiveness of antiviral combinations remains controversial 51-54 therefore blind or inappropriate use of antibiotics especially in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be avoided in the treatment of covid-19 strengthening bacteriological monitoring when there are secondary bacterial infections appropriate antimicrobial agents may timely be applied depending on the patients clinical presentation patients with mild cases can take oral antibiotics and antimicrobial agents such as amoxicillin azithromycin or fluoroquinolones against community-acquired pneumonia if the bacterial infection cannot be ruled out severe patients need to cover all possible pathogens for empirical treatment after the pathogen identified descending stair therapy 51 52 steroid therapy for severe ards is controversial thus systemic use of glucocorticoids should be cautious methylprednisolone can be used as appropriate in patients with rapid development or severe illness and 4080 mg daily can be considered depending on the severity of the disease with the total daily dose not exceeding 2 mgkg 55-57 previous studies on sars showed that timely noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure ventilation and corticosteroids were used when lung shadows increase and dyspnea worsens effective solutions appropriate use of glucocorticoids can significantly improve the clinical symptoms of sars patients reduce the extent of disease progression accelerate pulmonary disease and absorption but failed to shorten the length of hospitalization 55 56 steroid therapy has a specific incidence of adverse reactions 57neutralizing antibodies to the spike s protein on the surface of sars-cov-2 may be the first therapeutic strategy considered by biomedical researchers in academia and industry to provide passive immunity to illness 58 the newly released sars-cov-2 genome sequence genbank mn9089473 enables researchers to conduct gene synthesis in the laboratory and estimate the expression of s proteins as immunogens conventional methods of screening mice or rabbits for neutralizing antibodies might be too slow for this outbreak still rapid methods such as phage or yeast display libraries that express antibody fragments can be used to identify virally neutralizing antibody candidates quickly 59 60 the simplest most direct way to combat sars-cov-2 during the outbreak is to interfere with the viral entry into cells where antibodies usually work 61 it wont be effortless to confirm the functions of neutralizing antibodies quickly in addition ensuring that mutated rna viruses fail to enter the cells will be a challenge a cocktail of antibodies applied to the ebola pandemic could be used but it would add complexity to the production manner 62 however another strategy that does not rely on directly targeting to viral glycoproteins can apply to the treatment of covid-19 in this procedure viral receptor proteins on the host cell surface are neutralized thereby preventing the virus from binding and entering the cells fortunately investigators have already identified the viral receptors expressed on the cell surface up to date preprint publications have reported that sars-cov-2 employs angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 ace2 as the receptor for cell entry fig 5 26 which is the identical receptor that sars-cov uses for entry 63 both covs bind to ace2 through their s proteins on the virions after which the viral membrane and cell membrane fuse the rna virus sars-cov-2 then replicates its genome inside the host cell and new virions are eventually produced that are secreted to infect other cells the fact that both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 utilize the same ace2 receptor gives impetus to investigators to develop biologics for sars-cov promptly based on the sars reports some neutralizing antibodies are effective in preventing infections in the sars prevention models 64one important step to control covid-19 is to develop a vaccine in the first laboratory stage of a vaccine development it is necessary to screen the virus strains attenuate the virus strains as necessary 65 next steps are to study the adaptability of the virus strains to the cultured cell-matrix and the stability of the virus strains in the passage process to explore the stability of process quality and to establish animal models 66 dr paul stoffels vice chairman and chief scientific officer of johnson  johnson is one of the researchers who are engaged in the development of vaccines for sars-cov-2 according to his estimate it takes eight months to a year for the sars-cov-2 vaccine to be rigorously tested before it is ready for public use 67 it is also imperative to analyze the rate of sars-cov-2 genome evolution and to determine peptide vaccine targets 68 there are eight cd4 t-cell epitopes with high binding affinity within s e m and n proteins that are generally restricted by the human leukocyte antigen hla-dr alleles found in asian and asian-pacific populations 69 these immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated into the generic subunit coronavirus vaccine 69 they used highly conserved and annotated structural protein sequences of the representative sars-cov-2 strain wuhan-hu-1 mn9089473 to predict possible cd4 t-cell epitopes 69 their prediction method recommended by the iedb is based on the immune epitope database and analysis resources iedb consensus tool 69 however standard mapping epitopes are essential to the design of globally effective subunit vaccines they therefore examined common epitopes that are recognized by all dominant hla-dr alleles that are prevalent in five ethnic groups 69 their analyses demonstrated that a subunit vaccine including eight immunologically dominant hla-dr epitopes produced effective antiviral t-cell and antibody responses in populations of different ethnicities 69previous studies have observed that only 23 and 16 of the known sars-cov t cell and b cell epitopes respectively are the same as that of sars-cov-2 and no mutant sequences have been recognized in the available sars-cov-2 epitopes 70 this is a strong evidence of their potential to obtain a potent t cell or antibody response in sars-cov-2 in terms of t cells the identification of the sars-cov-derived epitopes located in the same location as sars-cov-2 and the large population assumed to be included is especially encouraging 70 it proposed further investigation into a vaccine designed to produce a protective t-cell response which has been proved to afford long-term protection in sars-cov 70 linear sars-cov-derived b cell epitopes in the s2 subunit may be more likely applicants for producing protective antibody responses 70 many of these epitopes despite their low exposure map to the same locations as those of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and preliminary outcomes have appeared indicating their potential for cross-reactive and antibody neutralization 70 therefore vaccine solutions that endeavor to produce antibodies targeting s2 linear epitopes might be useful and should be more investigatedthe current research data show that like sars-cov the sars-cov-2 receptor on human host cells is ace2 26 71 it is speculated that antibodies or drugs designed for sars may also be suitable for sars-cov-2 thus they can be used as priority product candidates for disease prevention and treatment vaccine research needs to be deployed for a long time from the experience of sars-cov research the inactivated virus vaccine may have an immunopathological enhancement effect 72 therefore adverse reactions should be carefully examined and controlled one of the candidates is an s-protein receptor-binding region-based vaccine 73 it has a protective effect against sars-cov in an experimental animal model when it comes to small molecular drugs for sars-cov-2 several teams from china have carried out the screening of compounds currently on the market as antivirals and found promising results in vitro which are expected to be verified in an experimental animal model and clinical trials 74 military academy of medical sciences institute of chinese academy of sciences and toxic drug research institute jointly found that three drugs including remdesivir chloroquine and ritonavir inhibited the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro
7576 in addition in 2017 zhangs group pointed to a host cell protease tmprss2 being a potentially important target for the treatment of influenza virus and coronavirus infections in the research on searching and screening the antiviral drugs 77 more recently results by hoffmanns group from germany demonstrate that sars-cov-2 spike proteins use the sars-coronavirus receptor ace2 for entry and the cellular protease tmprss2 for sars-cov-2 spike protein priming 78 a tmprss2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option other studies have also shown that yogurt and probiotics can help prevent lung infections in the elderly 79 since the outbreak of sars in 2003 chinas scientific research capacity in the field of preventive medicine has been dramatically improved in the outbreak of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 rapid progress has been made in etiology identification diagnostic reagent development virus characteristic analysis and clinical treatment strategy at the same time popular science education and media publicity have also played a decisive role and public awareness and social responsibility for the prevention and control of the epidemic have become an essential factor in curbing the rise of the epidemic however still much has to be done in this outbreak which is highlighted by the fact that essential questions such as the viruss mutation characteristics transmission pattern and traceability have yet to be answered the scientific and public health community still needs to reflect deeply and act quickly to meet the challenge of sars-cov-2 and more new pathogens in the futuresince ace2 is a functional receptor of sars-cov-2 its safety and potential impact on disease should be fully considered when applying angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei 74 therefore for patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 combined with hypertension calcium channel blockers ccbs are recommended if they are taking acei or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs 80 81 in severe cases bradykinin bk2 receptor blockers or direct renin inhibitor aliskiren can be used 82 if hypotension occurs antihypertensive drugs should be discontinued 14 the application of acei drugs is still controversial and needs further discussion 80 the sars-cov-2 causes covid-19 by infecting host cells via ace2 receptors and also causes damage to the myocardium although the mechanism is unclear patients with underlying cardiovascular disease had a poor prognosis after infection with sars-cov-2 80 81 for acute myocardial injury the primary disease should actively be treated and the myocardial protective treatment carried out 80 81 for patients with underlying heart disease especially st-elevation myocardial infarction stemi early reperfusion therapy should be performed under well-protected conditions for patients with sars-cov-2 infection with cardiovascular disease they should try to avoid using acei or arb 14 80 81the novel coronavirus was first detected in december 2019 during the outbreak of severe pneumonia in wuhan hubei province china the disease caused by the virus outbreak was finally named covid-19 which stands for the coronavirus cov disease 2019 and the etiologic virus sars- cov-2 which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome cov 2 by who scientific investigation is underway to learn more about the virus its origin and how it affects humans and the situation is changing rapidly most of the first patients in covid-19 claimed to be related to the huanan seafood market in wuhan indicating that the virus had a zoonotic origin however the source of the virus remains to be determined bats known as a reservoir for most viruses might be the original host of the new strain but the intermediate animal host is unknown the virus is similar to sars-cov-like cov in bats but is different from sars-cov and mers-cov one study suggests that the virus may be a recombination of a bat cov with a cov of unknown origin possibly from snakes 83 but there is no evidence to support this hypothesis human-to- human transmission has been confirmed in communities and medical institutions in china as well as in vietnam japan thailand germany and the united states 84 85 preliminary assessment of the transmission dynamics of the first 425 confirmed cases found that before january 1 2020 55 of the cases were related to the huanan seafood market in wuhan after this date only 86 of the cases were associated with this market 86 this confirms that human-to-human transmission has occurred between close contacts since the middle of december 2019 86 infections that occurred among health workers were also identified 86 it is unclear how easily the virus can be transmitted from person to person asymptomatic carriers can become contagious to others as there have been confirmed reports of transmission from asymptomatic contacts in germany 87the full genome of the virus has been deposited in genbank molecular assays using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr are needed to confirm the diagnosis there are no specific treatments available for covid-19 up to now therefore the main body of treatment is optimized to support treatment to reduce symptoms and maintain organ functions in more severe diseases also there are no specific anti-sars-cov-2 drugs however some existing antiviral medications have been used as part of clinical trials 88at present chinas national health commission has classified the new coronavirus as a class a infectious disease requiring the most stringent prevention and control measures including mandatory quarantine of patients and medical observation of those in close contact with them 4 many chinese cities are currently on lockdown because of travel bans and the suspension of public transport services it was reported that most of those who died were the elderly and individuals who had underlying illnesses 89 according to the first case report the overall case fatality rate is approximately 26 2 however this estimate should be treated with caution as the actual number of cases of infection and its course are not yet known we thus should carefully observe the current situation and take measures to control covid-19in december of 2019 the city of wuhan located in the hubei province of china became the epicenter of an outbreak of a pneumonia of unknown cause this pneumonia was later confirmed to be secondary to infection by a novel coronavirus this virus was originally called the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov but on february 11 2020 the disease was named covid-19 by the world health organization who and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv it is believed that the covid-19 outbreak has a zoonotic origin and began in the huanan wet seafood wholesale market in wuhan sars-cov-2 has proven to be extremely contagious and spreads easily from person to person cases of covid-19 have now spread beyond wuhan to many other provinces in china as well as other countries which has raised international attention and concern as of march 12 2020 more than 81000 human infections with sars-cov-2 and at least 3100 deaths related to covid-19 have been confirmed in china alone although the epidemic situation in china has been relatively under control the situation outside china is getting worse so far the covid-19 viral disease that has swept into at least 114 countries with more than 60000 cases diagnosed and more than 4000 people killed is now officially a pandemic as who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus announced in geneva on march 11at first covid-19 appeared in a few clusters and was more likely to affect persons with advanced age or other comorbidities but it is now more widespread infection can result in severe pneumonia and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 1 2 the main clinical presentation includes fever dry cough fatigue and malaise andor non-specific upper respiratory tract infection symptoms that may not be particularly noticeable as previously reported 1 patients with severe illness can develop dyspnea and some even developed ards and required icu admission and oxygen therapy laboratory findings of patients infected with sars-cov-2 include lymphopenia elevated crp and erythrocyte sedimentation rate genetic sequencing of sars-cov-2 has enabled the rapid development of point-of-care real-time rt-pcr diagnostic tests specific for covid-19 3 4 novel coronavirus nucleic acids are detected in throat swabs sputum lower respiratory tract secretions and blood at present the diagnosis of covid-19 is primarily based on the patients epidemiological history clinical symptoms chest imaging findings and etiological evidence viral nucleic acid testing is an important diagnostic criterion however it has some limitations false negatives from viral nucleic acid testing arise from the uneven quantity of detection technology disease characteristics asymptomatic patients and status of epidemic prevention and control as well as errors in clinical sampling 5 covid-19 is highly contagious thus early detection and diagnosis are of paramount importance to isolate suspected cases and contacts to control the outbreak the challenges in identification of pathogens by viral nucleic acid testing have made some frontline clinicians propose ct as a diagnostic method for identifying covid-19 patients this review aims to briefly introduce the novel coronavirus pneumonia and highlight the value of imaging in its diagnosiscoronaviruses typically result in respiratory and enteric infections and affect both animals and humans six coronavirus species are known to cause human infection two of which typically can cause severe respiratory illness and fatalities sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus which had an outbreak in guangdong china between 2002 and 2003 and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus which had an outbreak in 2012 outbreaks in the middle east 6 7 by january 7 2020 chinese scientists had isolated the novel coronavirus from patients in wuhan 3 it has been reported 8 that sars-cov-2 was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 than to known human-infecting coronaviruses including the virus that caused the sars outbreak of 2003 molecular modeling has shown structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 which suggests that sars-cov-2 may use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace 2 as a receptor the differences of the etiological characteristics among sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are shown in table 1on december 31 2019 the health commission of hubei province in china announced that 27 patients were afflicted with this mysterious disease which was subsequently discovered to be covid-19 the outbreak is believed to zoonotic in origin and likely started at the huanan wet seafood wholesale market in wuhan sars-cov-2 is highly contagious and the basic reproductive number of the virus was estimated to be 22 9 10 covid-19 has spread beyond wuhan to other cities in china and other countries in recent days there is a significant growth trend in other countries especially in south korea japan italy and iran the current global situation as of march 13 2020 of covid-19 is shown in fig 1in the available reports the bat is the most possible host of the sars-cov-2 and another animal may act as an intermediate host between bats and humans 8 11 to this point the main infection sources were the patients infected with sars-cov-2 covid-19 mainly spread via human-to-human transmission through respiratory droplets and contact the human population in general is susceptible while the elderly as well as people with underlying diseases show more serious conditions after infection 12 although most people were reported to have a good prognosis of covid-19 it is unknown whether there are potential impacts on the patients in the future and the sequelae are not available in the case of the sars outbreak significant impact on pulmonary function functional capacity and quality of life was found during patient follow-up 13 14 the additional and detailed information about etiology and epidemiology is provided in electronic supplementary material esmchest radiograph of covid-19 is not routinely recommended in clinical practice currently because they are insensitive to detecting covid-19 in the early stage however chest radiography may have some utility with the potential to serve as a screening tool on the frontlines in medical settings with limited resources or in cases where the patients physical condition does not allow for transport to the radiology department ct scanner as the disease progresses beyond the early stage chest radiography can detect multiple patchy opacities throughout the lungs these opacities eventually become confluent and severe cases may appear as a whited out lung 15 in more advanced cases in addition to the ground glass opacity and consolidation even pleural fluid in a severe case has been reported on the chest radiographs 2 16 progressive opacities and consolidation have been observed on chest radiographs over the time course of the illness 17 in the first case of covid-19 reported in the usa there were no obvious abnormalities on the chest radiograph during the early stages after the onset of symptoms however on day 9 of the illness an increased area left basilar opacity was visible on chest radiography then stable streaky opacities in the lung bases were visible and the opacities have steadily increased over time 18computed tomography ct imaging is strongly recommended because it is very sensitive to detecting early disease assessing the nature and extent of lesions and discovering subtle changes that are often not visible on chest radiography the imaging features of lesions are always described with the following factors distribution quantity shape pattern density and concomitant signs 19the typical chest ct imaging characteristics of covid-19 include multiple peripheral bilateral patchy sub-segmental or segmental ground glass opacities and areas of consolidation which are mostly distributed along the bronchovascular bundles and subpleural space the presence of associated interlobular septal thickening in the areas of ground glass opacity can give a crazy paving appearance air bronchograms with the areas of consolidation and bronchial wall thickening are often present more rarely there is a thickening of the adjacent pleura or interlobar pleura and a small amount of pleural effusion there is no obvious lymphadenopathy 15 tables 2 3 the imaging features mentioned above are consistent with the findings from 81 patients in a recently reported article in which the predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral peripheral ill-defined and ground glass opacification mainly involving the right lower lobes 20 furthermore in the currently available reports the most common chest ct findings in covid-19 patients are the peripheral areas of ground glass opacityconsolidation without subpleural sparing which are bilateral in distribution 2123 in one study of 21 patients most had more than two lobes affected 15 of 21 71 with bilateral involvement 16 of 21 76 24 another study showed that the most common patterns of covid-19 on thin-section ct images are pure ground glass opacity ground glass opacity with intra- andor interlobular septal thickening and ground glass opacity with consolidation and consolidation with prominent distribution in the posterior and peripheral part of the lungs 25 in a large research cohort study chest ct findings showed a bilateral distribution of patchy ground glass opacity and consolidation in 138 patients 26 typical chest radiograph and chest ct of covid-19 are shown in figs 2 and 3in expert recommendations from the chinese medical association radiology branch chest ct manifestations of covid-19 are divided into three stages early advanced and severe based on the extent of lesion involvement 15 this current clinical guideline recommends dividing covid-19 into four stages according to the time of onset and the response of body to the virus with additional dissipation stage fig 4early stage chest ct shows single or multiple scattered patchy or conglomerate ground glass opacities predominantly in the middle and lower lungs and along the bronchovascular bundles these ground glass lesions are often located in peripheral and subpleural areas of the lung intra- and interlobular septal thickening sometimes present in the areas of ground glass opacity can give a crazy paving pattern the pathological process during this stage is dilatation and congestion of the alveolar septal capillary exudation of fluid in alveolar cavity and interlobular interstitial edema 19 one patient had normal chest ct at initial presentation however 3 days later the disease progressed and developed a solitary rounded ground glass lesion in the right lower lobe indicating this pattern may represent the very first radiologically visible manifestation in patients infected with sars-cov-2 24advanced stage at this stage chest cts will show new lesions that are similar to the earlier lesions described above in addition findings from the early stage of disease increase in density and extent coexisting with the new areas of disease as areas of consolidation grow air bronchograms are often present in the areas of consolidation a previous case report described a patient who had evolved into a mixed pattern of ground glass opacities and consolidation by 15 after onset of symptoms 27 the pathological features in this stage are the accumulation of a cell-rich exudate in the alveolar cavity vascular expansion and exudation in the interstitium the fibrous exudation connects each alveolus through the interalveolar space to form a fusion state 19severe stage as the disease further progresses chest ct shows diffuse consolidation of the lungs of varying density secondary to the fibrous exudate into the alveolar cavity air bronchograms and bronchial dilation non-consolidated areas of the lung appear as patchy ground glass opacity when most of the lungs are involved the lungs appear as a whited out lung the pleura is thickened and there can be a small amount of pleural effusiondissipation stage images show gradual resolution of the ground glass opacity and consolidation in the lungs with some residual curvilinear opacities compatible with fibrosisafter isolation and treatment a majority of patients infected by covid-19 stabilize and gradually recover and on imaging the areas of disease decrease correspondingly however in a small number of patients with underlying disease or advanced age the disease progresses during the treatment with the scope of the lesions in the lungs expanding and increasing density eventually appearing as whited out lungson the frontlines of fighting the covid-19 epidemic chest imaging particularly chest ct now has an irreplaceable role in the early diagnosis of covid-19 as well as monitoring the diseases clinical course covid-19 has characteristic manifestations in the lung that are readily detected on chest ct as described in some recent publications 15 24 25 in several prior reports chest ct showed progression of disease that corresponded with worsening clinical symptoms and also disease resolution as the patients clinically recovered 21 22 27 in a recent report 20 the predominant pattern of abnormality in covid-19 observed on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first ct scan has some differences lesions quickly evolved from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 13 weeks indicating the change through clinical course which was also reflected on the number of involved lung segments in a prior study of 51 patients the absolute number of lung findings increased with the time from symptom onset and lesions with consolidations including ground glass opacities with consolidation and pure consolidation showed mildly positive correlation with the time between symptom onset and the ct 25 another report demonstrated mild or moderate progression of disease as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities during follow-up 24 in the context of typical clinical presentation and exposure history some patients may present with negative results of rt-pcr for covid-19 but have characteristic imaging features of covid-19 on chest ct subsequently these patients whose labs were initially negative for covid-19 did test positive later with repeat swab tests thus in patients at high risk for covid-19 chest ct evidence of viral pneumonia may precede negative rt-pcr test results and present as an important warning signal a combination of repeated swab tests and ct scanning may be helpful for individuals with high clinical suspicion of covid-19 but negative rt-pcr screening 28 29 chest ct has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of covid-19 in a report of 51 patients with chest ct and rt-pcr assay performed within 3 days the sensitivity of chest ct was greater than that of rt-pcr for covid-19 at initial patient presentation 98 vs 71 respectively p  0001 30 in another study of 1014 patients 59 had positive rt-pcr results and 88 had positive chest ct scans the sensitivity of chest ct in suggesting covid-19 was 97 based on positive rt-pcr results between 60 and 93 of cases had initial positive ct consistent with covid-19 prior or parallel to the initial positive rt-pcr results 31 in addition chest ct can evaluate disease severity in terms of the percentage of pneumonia lesions in the entire lung volume the difference between the earlier stage patients and the severe stage patients is statistically significant 32 in an initial prospective analysis of the clinical features of 41 patients chest ct images of icu patients on admission showed bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation and overall had more imaging abnormalities than non-icu patients 1 older patients may have more systemic symptoms more extensive lung involvement and worse prognosis than younger patients 33 thus the typical ct findings of covid-19 can not only help early screening suspected cases but can also monitor the clinical progression and may predict severe complications such as acute respiratory diseases with high sensitivity for covid-19 chest ct would play a very important role in the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 in the high-risk regions and countries in some extreme situations in very high-risk areas wuhan china ct was the one of main diagnostic criteria for this disease due to the relatively high false negative of rt-pcr for some low-risk regions and countries positive predictive value of ct alone or adding ct to rt-pcr should be adjusted the proposition of ct could be tempered to some degree therefore to be more accurate the role of chest ct in covid-19 should be assessed based on the prevalence of the disease in each areathe ct appearance of covid-19 shares some similarities with other diseases that cause viral pneumonia including influenza viruses parainfluenza virus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus rhinovirus human metapneumovirus etc table 4 in particular those within the same viridae sars and mers have great similarities in imaging findings because they belong to the same coronaviridae family and thus need to be excluded through clinical manifestations and laboratory pathogen detection imaging in mers pneumonia can also show ground glass lesions in the subpleural and basal parts with consolidation and fibrosis changes can be left after healing 34 in the pneumonia patients infected by respiratory syncytial virus chest ct mainly manifested as small centrilobular nodules and areas of consolidation which are often asymmetrically distributed in the lungs adenovirus pneumonia shows bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with patchy consolidations on ct images and may show lobar or segmental distribution human parainfluenza virus pneumonia may show centrilobular nodules with bronchial wall thickening that differentiates it from the imaging appearances of the other viruses radiographs in patients with influenza pneumonia show bilateral patchy areas of ground glass opacity with or without focal areas of consolidation usually in the lower lobes 34 in a report on h1n1 influenza infection in addition to the most common findings of ground glass opacity interlobular septal thickening and centrilobular nodules were the second most frequent findings 35 rapidly progressive ground glass opacities and consolidations with air bronchograms and interlobular septal thickening with right lower lobe predominance are the main imaging findings in h7n9 pneumonia 36 viruses are a common cause of respiratory infection and recognition of viral pneumonia patterns may help in the differentiation among viral pathogens while the definite diagnosis is achieved by laboratory detection of virusin addition covid-19 also needs to be distinguished from mycoplasma pneumonia chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia other diseases that need to be identified are vasculitis acute interstitial pneumonia connective tissue-related lung disease and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia 15the covid-19 initially began in china however it is extremely contagious and has spread beyond china to many other countries raising concerns and posing not only a huge threat to global public health but also a huge economic burden and panic to society early disease recognition can prompt early patient isolation and early diagnosis and treatment in the current situation imaging of covid-19 particularly with chest ct has a very high value because it shows characteristic manifestations and has enabled frontline clinicians to have primary diagnosis in their first contact with suspected patients even in the presence of initially false negative lab results earlier diagnosis with the aid of imaging allows for early containment and response to this communicable disease as well as overcoming the outbreak as soon as possible through a joint effortin december 2019 a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was observed in wuhan china a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen

 provisionally named as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019ncov by the world health organization who on 11 february 2020 who named this novel coronavirus pneumonia as covid19 coronavirus disease 2019 on the basis of phylogeny taxonomy and established practice the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov and renamed it as sarscov2
7
 sarscov2 belongs to species of severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus sarsrcov and genus betacoronavirus
2
 covid19 rapidly triggered a global health emergency alert and spread to 46 countries by 27 february 2020 sarscov2 is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infects humans like sarscov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov sarscov2 is responsible for lower respiratory infection and can cause acute respiratory distress syndromes ards other human coronaviruses hcov 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 are responsible for upper respiratory infections and common cold
8

by 27 february 2020 according to open data from china cdc as shown in table 1 and figure 1 covid19 has caused 82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths globally the total casefatality rate is 346 as shown in table 1 because covid19 started from wuhan the capital city of hubei province with a large population of nearly 14 million people 583 cases are in wuhan a total of 1932 health workers have been infected in wuhan alone
9
 which overwhelmed the local health system and resulted in the highest casefatality rate 442 excluding hubei province the rest of china has 13 045 cases 109 fatalities 084 outside of china covid19 has spread to 46 countries and has caused 3664 infections and 67 fatalities 183 overall the casefatality rate of covid19 so far is much lower than either sars 96 or mers 345
10
 here we summarized common and discrete features of sarscov2 in comparison to its two predecessors sarscov and merscov in genetics epidemiology clinical features and further discussed challenges for diagnosis and special control measures for covid19fulllength genome sequences of sarscov2 were obtained from early infected individuals related to a wild animal market in wuhan by different research groups through nextgeneration sequencing

 full genomic length of this novel coronavirus ranges from 29 891 to 29 903 nucleotides nt

 all viral genome sequences obtained are extremely similar showing more than 9998 sequence identity sarscov2 is 962 identical at the wholegenome level to a bat coronavirus isolate ratg13 global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid accession no epiisl402131 collected from yunnan province china and is 88 identical to two batderived sarslike coronaviruses batslcovzc45 and batslcovzxc21 collected in 2018 in zhoushan eastern china
1
 
2
 
11
 the close phylogenetic relationship to ratg13 suggests bats are probably natural hosts for sarscov2
2
 human sarscov2 have a unique rrar motif in the spike protein which is not found in coronaviruses isolated from pangolins suggesting sarscov2 may not come directly from pangolins
12
 an evolutionary study
13
 based on 86 genomic sequences from gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg showed three deletions were found in isolates from japan usa and australia 93 mutations found over the entire genomes of note eight mutations were found in the spike surface glycoprotein especially three mutations d354 y364 and f367 located in the spike surface glycoprotein receptorbinding domain rbd which suggested sarscov2 may rapidly evolve to evade immune response and adapt to other hosts in the futuresarscov2 share 79 nt sequence identity to sarscov and around 50 to merscov
2
 however the seven conserved replicase domains in orf1ab used for cov species classification of sarscov2 are 946 identical to sarscov implying the two belong to same species
1
 
2
 the receptorbinding protein spike s gene of sarscov2 is highly divergent to all previously described sarsrcovs with less than 75 nt sequence identity to except a 931 nt identity to ratg13 homology modeling revealed sarscov2 had a similar rbd structure to that of sarscov
11
 further study showed sarscov2 uses the same cell entry receptor ace2 as sarscov not cd26 as merscov
2
 structural analysis by cryoelectron microscopy revealed sarscovs protein binds ace2 with 10 to 20 folds higher affinity than sarscov
14
 which suggests that sarscov2 may be more infectious to human than sarscovtransmission of infectious diseases must rely on three conditions sources of infection routes of transmission and susceptible hosts as the covid19 continues spreading more epidemiologic features of sarscov2 have been revealed on the basis of recently published literatures we compared transmission features of sarscov2 with sarscov and merscov in table 2 all three epidemics caused by these three coronaviruses are linked to wild animal markets sars and mers are defined as zoonotic disease and transmitted by intermediated hosts palm civets and dromedary camels respectively
11
 recent studies showed pangolins

 and snakes
16
 at wild animal markets were likely to be intermediate hosts of sarscov2humantohuman transmission was considered as a major transmission mode according to the sixth version of the guidance for diagnosis and treatments for covid19 issued by the national health commission of china sarscov2 was transmitted through respiratory aspirates droplets contacts and feces and aerosols transmission is highly possible chan et al
6
 reported that six familial members got covid19 but none of them had contacts with wuhan markets or animals although two had visited a wuhan hospital on the bais of data from china cdc 583 of covid19 cases are in wuhan while the rest of cases are imported from wuhan wuhan is the capital of chinas hubei province with over 14 million inhabitants and is a major transportation hub which increases persontoperson contacts and adds to the possibility of exporting cases to other locations the early outbreak data largely followed the exponential growth before the implementation of quarantine strategies by governments on 24 january 2020 the basic reproductive values r0 of covid19 at the early stage were calculated between 2 and 35 indicating that one patient could transmit the disease to two to three other people
17

20
 which was higher than sars and mers phylodynamic analysis based on 52 genomic sequences of sarscov2 strains sampled in different countries publicly available at gisaid showed the estimated mean evolutionary rate was 78  104 subssiteyear range 11  104 to 15  104 which was in line with that of sars and mers and the mean time of the most recent common ancestor was 73 days
21
 with enforced implementation of isolation strategies r0 was expected to decline in coming days the mean incubation period was around 64 days ranges from 0 to 24 days

similar to sars and mers nosocomial transmission was a severe problem to covid19 and even worse a recent retrospective study

 indicated that a total of 1716 health workers were infected accounting for 384 of total cases nosocomial infections extremely burdened the health system and hindered early infected individuals from getting immediate medical supports therefore resulting in high casefatality rate in wuhan as shown in table 1 in wuhan alone 1080 health workers were infected in return casefatality rate of wuhan is the highest wang et al
23
 reported that among 138 hospitalized patients with covid19 41 of patients were suspected to be infected via hospitalrelated transmission 26 of patients received intensive care unit icu care and mortality was 43 a lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as highrisk factors for nosocomial transmission such as intubation manual ventilation by resuscitator noninvasive ventilation highflow nasal cannula bronchoscopy examination suction and patient transportation
24
 unexpectedly a large portion of nosocomial transmissions occurred through contacts between clinicians and visitors with no or mild symptoms of covid19 at the early phase of this outbreak similarly presymptomatic transmission occurred through familial
25
 
26
 
27
 and social gatherings
27
 such as banquets church activities sports cruise travelingvertical transmission was sporadically reported in some media but not yet proved chen et al
28
 investigated nine pregnant women with covid19 in their third trimester who underwent cesarean section sarscov2 was tested in the amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swab and breast milk samples from six pregnant women with covid19 pneumonia and got all negative results none of the neonates has clinical signs of infection this result suggested no intrauterine fetal infections occurred as a result of covid19 infection during the late stage of pregnancy previous studies also showed no evidence of perinatal infection of sarscov or merscov during pregnancy
29
 however a neonate born to a pregnant woman with covid19 pneumonia tested positive for sarscov2 infection 36 hours after birth at wuhan tongji hospital
28
 it is reasonable to assume that a newborn could be infected either in utero or perinatally and thus newborns should be placed in isolation to avoid exposure to any source of infectionin terms of susceptible populations all groups were generally susceptible to covid19 regardless of age or sex
9
 patients aged from 30 to 79 accounted for 866 of all cases
9
 the median age of the patients was 47 years
30

unlike sars and mers patients diagnosed as covid19 have presented with high viral loads even when those have no fever or mild symptoms
31
 high titers of sarscov2 were detected in travelers who recently visited wuhan and have no fever or mild symptoms in the united states
31
 and germany
32
 and other places
33
 a study showed high viral loads were detected in upper respiratory specimens of patients with covid19 and viral shedding pattern of patients resembles that of patients with influenza
33
 this suggests sarscov2 may stay around for some time like influenza virusesthe full spectrum of disease severity as shown in the guidelines for diagnosis and treatments for covid19
34
 issued by the national health commission of china had been updated for six times by 19 february 2020 covid19 is now classified as four levels based on the severity of symptoms mild moderate severe and critical mild patients only present mild symptoms without radiographic features moderate patients present with fever respiratory symptoms and radiographic features severe patients meet one of three criteria a dyspnea rr greater than 30 timesmin b oxygen saturation less than 93 in ambient air and c pao2fio2 less than 300 mm hg critical patients meet one of three criteria a respiratory failure b septic shock and c multiple organ failure the largest epidemiology study done by china cdc
9
 showed among 44 672 confirmed cases 866 of confirmed patients were aged 30 to 79 years 809 were considered mildcommon pneumonia 138 were severe cases and 47 were critical cases casefatality rate for critical patients was 49 patients with comorbidities cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease hypertension and cancers had higher casefatality rates 105 73 65 60 and 56 respectively than those without comorbidities 09 this indicated comorbidities were highrisk factors for patients with covid19clinical symptoms of severe and critical patients with covid19 resembled most of sars and mers as listed in table 3 including fever dry cough myalgia fatigue dyspnea anorexia diarrhea ards arrhythmia acute kidney injury various degrees of liver damage and septic shock common symptoms of hospitalized patients with covid19 included fever 986 fatigue 696 dry cough
23
 
35
 and diarrhea
36
 less common symptoms included muscle ache confusion headache sore throat rhinorrhoea chest pain sputum production
36
 and nausea and vomiting
35
 severe complications included ards rnaaemia acute cardiac injury and multiple organ failure
36
 the median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 50 days to hospital admission was 70 days and to ards was 80 days
23
 a few patients had symptoms such as nasal congestion runny nose sore throat myalgia and diarrhea
34
 most patients had a good prognosis according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatments for covid19
34
 wang et al
23
 reported that age and comorbidity may be risk factors a recent study showed that renal damage was caused by virus and antiviral drugs
37
 meanwhile sarscov2 might cause various degrees of liver damage
38
 and damages in testicular tissue
37
 mild patients showed only low fever mild fatigue and no pneumonia severe patients usually had dyspneahypoxemia 1 week after the onset critical patients could quickly progress to ards shock metabolic acidosis coagulation dysfunction and multiple organ functional failure
34
 dyspnea abdominal pain and anorexia were also more common in critically ill patients
23
 it had to be noted that severe and critically ill patients might present moderate to low fever even without obvious fever
34

laboratory features of covid19 included lymphopenia with depletion of cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes prolonged prothrombin time elevated lactate dehydrogenase
23
 elevated ddimer elevated alanine transaminase creactive protein and creatinine kinase
36
 icu patients had higher plasma levels of il2 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tumor necrosis factor compared with nonicu patients
36
 patients who received icu care had numerous laboratory abnormalities that suggested covid19 might be associated with cellular immune deficiency coagulation activation myocardia injury hepatic injury and kidney injury as showed in table 3 laboratory abnormalities were similar to those previously observed in patients with merscov and sarscov infection
23
 
39
 most patients had elevated c reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate and normal procalcitonin in severe cases ddimer increased and peripheral blood lymphocytes progressively decreased severe and critically ill patients had elevated inflammatory factors
34
 in the nonsurvivors the neutrophil count ddimer blood urea and creatinine levels continued to increase
23

xray and chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or groundglass opacity in the lungs of moderate and severe patients
35
 it had to be noted that majority of covid19 patients with mildmoderate symptoms can quickly transit into severe or critical statuses if without immediate care
40
 these virus carriers with no or mild symptoms can fool health workers and could be huge challenges for controlling this epidemicdiagnosis of covid19 has been facing difficulties because laboratory detections and radiographic images are not always in agreement with clinical features and contact histories of patients
41
 laboratory detections included genomic sequencing reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr and serological methods such as enzymelinked immunoassay elisa in addition because manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were diverse and changed rapidly judging by radiographic images for early detection and evaluation of disease severity and followup of patients were heavily depended on experience
40
 as a result clinically suspected patients with a history of exposure fever and positive findings on chest ct had to receive rapid diagnosis with molecular technologies
42

genomic sequencing was a way for identifying diseaseassociated pathogens
2
 
11
 at the beginning of the outbreak of covid19 but it was too complicated and expensive for a large scale of detections rtpcr methods based on spike gene and n gene developed by several companies and china cdc were widely used for detecting viral rna and were considered a gold standard
2
 
11
 
34
 
43
 however this method had its limitations such as short detection window from nasopharyngeal swabs false sampling crosscontamination of samples and inconsistence of sample collections and preparationsrtpcr methods generated falsepositive or falsenegative results
42
 
44
 which caused troubles for isolating sources of infections and determining hospitalization days according to current guidelines for diagnosis and treatments for covid19 if one is tested by rtpcr negative for twice heshe is considered the cured and should be discharged however some of cured and discharged patients later have been tested positive by rtpcr
45
 presumably many factors mentioned above could lead to false negative in these cases on the other hand a proportion of patients with fever or pneumonia were wrongly isolated together with other confirmed patients with covid19 in general medical wards because rtpcr could produce falsepositive results due to sample contaminations or other reasons these patients turned out to be infected by influenza or other pneumonia associated pathogens a recent large diagnostic study
42
 showed 316 patients were confirmed infected with multiple respiratory pathogens including common hcov 5 cases influenza a virus 2 cases rhinovirus 12 cases and influenza a h3n2 12 cases respiratory syncytial virus 7 cases influenza b virus 6 cases and metapneumovirus 4 cases in addition rtpcr methods could generate inconsistent results a fluorescencebased quantitative pcr kit urgently distributed by the china cdc was designed to detect np and orf1ab regions on the sarscov2 genome sometimes the results from the two pairs of primers did not agree with each other
42
 besides technical difficulties deletions and mutations in genome of sarscov2 occurred during viral evolution may also contribute to false results generated by rtpcrelisa was highly recommended and expected to improve detection rate for covid19
42
 because sampling blood was much less stringent than sampling nasal or oral swabs for detecting viruses and antibodies allows much longer detection window than viruses furthermore elisa had a quick turnaround time and relatively low costs the strength of elisa methods could make up of the shortages of rtpcr
44
 elisa method based on sarsrcov rp3 nucleocapsid protein was successfully developed to detect immunoglobulin m and immunoglobulin g against sarscov2 in early covid19 cases
2
 a caveat is that this elisa method may generate falsepositive results as n protein is the most conservative viral protein among human coronavirus genus
46
 antigens used in elisa may react with antibodies against four other hcov that occurred in common colds s protein is the most diverse protein and may be good candidate for elisa development
2

differential diagnosis is also critical for confirming cases of covid19 winter usually has higher prevalence of flu and other pathogens associated pneumonia in all diagnosis of covid19 has to be based on comprehensive understanding of epidemic history clinical features radiographic features and laboratory detection
34

isolation is still the most effective means of containing covid19
47
 effective surveillance is the prerequisite for blocking the source of infections many methods are applied to recognize source of infections laboratory confirmed patients suspected infected persons and closely contacted persons including community registration tracing suspected carrier by cell phones those evaluated at moderatehigh risk of exposure are encouraged to report conditions daily general medical wards were used to collectively monitor and treat mild patients
42
 
48

therapeutics of covid19 primarily include symptomatic treatments and antiviral therapies early supportive interventions are critical for treating mild patients including nutrient supplements oxygen therapy chinese herbal medicine and antibacterial therapy patients infected with covid19 are mostly middle aged and elderly generally with low resistance to infection
42
 supportive treatments are necessary for patients with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection for critically ill patients highflow oxygen therapy extracorporeal membrane oxygenation glucocorticoid therapy and administration of convalescent plasma are applied
34
 
49
 there are several suggested antiviral treatments lopinavirritonavir ribavirin interferon chloroquine phosphate and abidor it is not recommended to use three or more antiviral drugs above simultaneously
34
 
50
 
51
 combinational use of lopinavir ritonavir and ribavirin in the treatment of sars was reported to be associated with better outcome
52
 it was previously reported that chloroquine could inhibit sarscov
53
 and was tested for treating covid19 in clinical trials in china recently several studies suggested remdesivir effectively inhibit rna viruses including sarsmerscov2019ncov infection
51
 
54
 
55
 remdesivir was used on the first patient in the united states and showed promising results
31
 currently three clinical trials were registered for testing remdesivir on the treatment of covid19 httpclinicaltrialsgov in addition a pancoronavirus fusion inhibitor ek1 targeting the hr1 domain of hcov spike was reported to have the potential to treat covid19
56
 convalescent sera were used for treating critically ill patients and show some effects
57

recent report indicated that transmission may occur from individuals with no symptoms or from convalescents
42
 
58
 it is likely that sarscov2 will stay around for some time and even coevolve with its hosts due to uncertainty of clinical spectrum of virus carriers vaccination is highly recommended for susceptible populations especially for those with comorbidities cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease hypertension and cancers vaccines based on s protein t cell epitopes and rbd have been studied for sars and mers
56
 
59
 
60
 
61
 recently an oral vaccine based on yeast expressed s protein developed by a group of scientists in tianjing university of china provoked a lot of interests after it was reported by jingyun news however it needs to be further tested in clinical trials on 24 february 2020 moderna a pharmaceutical company in the united states announced that its experimental messenger rna mrna covid19 vaccine known as mrna1273 was ready for human testing and the initial batch of the vaccine were shipped to us government researchers from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases we have reasons to believe that vaccines would be a way to prevent viral infection because convalescent sera could improve conditions of critically ill patients
57
 in addition to the protective and therapeutic measures mentioned above psychological interventions were expected to be helpful for infection control
62

latest literatures and official data from china cdc revealed the epidemic of covid19 caused more infections and deaths than either sars or mers by far despite the fact that its casefatality rate is much lower sarscov2 appears to be more infectious than sarscov or merscov based on r0 values calculated at the early stage of this outbreak majority of infected individuals with no or mild symptoms can release viruses and spread viruses to others which is extremely challenging for preventing the spread of covid19 therefore intense surveillance is vital for preventing sustained transmission active interventions including nutrition supplement symptomatic treatment and antiviral treatment are critical for mild patients as well as severe patients finally prophylactic vaccination is highly demanded for future prevention of emerging coronavirusrelated epidemics or pandemicsthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsqq conceived wrote and revised the paper yw yw and yc equally contribute to writing all authors approved the final version of the manuscript before submissionsince late 2002 outbreaks of atypical pneumonia of unknown aetiology primarily affecting close family contacts and health care workers have occurred in the guangdong province in southern china the world health organization who was first informed in february 2003 by the chinese ministry of health of an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome involving 305 cases and five deaths that occurred in southern china1 a number of major outbreaks were then reported in mainland china hong kong vietnam toronto singapore and taiwan with an increasing number of reports of this unusual infection across asia the us centers for disease control and prevention termed this condition severe acute respiratory syndrome sars2 the case definition of sars is periodically updated based on clinical features radiological and virological findings and a positive contact history patients can be categorised into suspect and probable sars cases3
the epidemic of sars in hong kong started in march 2003 of the total of nearly 1800 cases approximately 110 were children and adolescents sars has shown its potential to spread rapidly across the globe this new respiratory infection has been noted to be highly contagious household contacts and health care workers who cared for patients with this type of atypical pneumonia were particularly prone to acquiring it the clinical presentation and progression are very different in children from those in adults in this paper we summarise current knowledge on the epidemiology aetiology clinical features laboratory features and the experience in the treatment of sars in childrensars is believed to have originated in southern china two major case clusters in hong kong occurred in a hospital and an apartment complex it began when an infected doctor who had been treating patients with sars in mainland china came from zhongshan county to hong kong in february 20034 he had stayed in the hotel in hong kong for just 2 days but many visitors and guests had by then already contracted the disease these infected individuals from the index hotel returned to their home countries and initiated the sars outbreaks in the hospital systems of hong kong toronto singapore and hanoi5 6 7 8 the clinical features of the infection and the route of spread were not well understood at the beginning of the outbreaks in early march health care workers become infected because they did not wear proper personal protective equipment while caring for the infected patients the infection was subsequently brought outside the health care setting by hospital workers and visitorsa 26-year-old gentleman who was admitted because of pneumonia to the prince of wales hospital in hong kong in early march was among the infected visitors from the index hotel within 2 weeks over 150 health care workers medical students and the other patients as well as visitors to the index ward were infected5 the use of a jet nebuliser in the index case is believed to have generated a large volume of infectious droplets following this case cluster a major community outbreak occurred in a large apartment complex called amoy gardens a patient on renal dialysis who contracted sars when staying in the index ward visited his relatives at amoy gardens over 300 people were subsequently infected9 this outbreak was likely to have been caused by leaky sewage pipes that generated an aerosol that was contaminated with infectious faecal material the floor drains of the bathrooms and kitchens were connected to the sewage pipes and a backflow of the infectious aerosol probably contributed to the spread of the infection within the apartment building during this community outbreak contacts and residents at the amoy gardens were put into quarantine to prevent the possible spread of sars within the communityoverall the paediatric burden of the disease is rather limited in all regions with a sars outbreak nearly one-quarter of the infected cases in hong kong were health care workers only 6 of all sars cases being children or adolescents under 18 years of age there has not been any spread of sars in the school setting in hong kong despite the fact that many infected children were attending school until they developed symptoms of the infection massive public education and campaigns have however occurred via different channels of the mass media since late march 2003 children were advised to stay at home if they had any fever or a respiratory tract infection schools were suspended in an attempt to limit the outbreak similar quarantine measures were also carried out in mainland china the experience in guangzhou and beijing was similar to that of hong kong paediatric cases accounting for less than 5 of the total patient numberthe global collaboration in trying to identify the causative agent for sars resulted in an unprecedented speed of progress the who has established a laboratory network with 13 laboratories around the world to facilitate the search for the possible infectious agent10 sars was then found to be caused by a new strain of coronavirus called sars-associated coronavirus11 12 coronaviruses are classified under the order nidovirales that are a group of enveloped rna viruses13 they are known to cause common respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals14 15
despite the identification of the sars-associated coronavirus a reliable laboratory test for early diagnosis is still not widely available although the virus can be detected in respiratory secretions stools and urine using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr many 50 of our sars patients with coronavirus infection confirmed by serology were initially negative on rt-pcr testing the sensitivity of this rapid test depends on the types of specimen collected the quality of the specimens and the timing of their collection10 16 virus isolation can also be performed by co-culturing clinical specimens stool urine and respiratory secretions with vero cells these procedures are however technically demanding and can only be carried out in specialised laboratories serum antibody testing using enzyme immunoassay and indirect fluorescence antibody assay have also been developed but sars patients will not receive a positive result until the third week of their illness these tests can therefore only be used to confirm the diagnosis later in the course of the illness9 12 a history of close contact with a known sars patient remains the most important clue to alert paediatricians to a possible diagnosis of this infection the identification of the genome sequence of this new coronavirus will facilitate the development of accurate rapid diagnostic tests specific vaccines and other specific anti-viral agents17 18
the clinical presentation and course of illness in adults have been well characterised from several large cohorts in hong kong singapore and toronto5 6 7 8 9 11 12 the incubation period of sars is 510 days most patients present with fever a dry cough and shortness of breath coryza is relatively uncommon in infected adults other common symptoms include myalgia chills headache and dizziness the presentation in children is different after a similar incubation period children with this infection usually present with fever dry cough and a runny nose these symptoms are clinically indistinguishable from those of other mild upper respiratory tract infections19 20 the other typical symptoms of myalgia dizziness chills and rigors found in adults are not common in young children the initial chest examination will be normal in most young children whereas inspiratory crackles predominantly in the lung base are usually found in adolescent and adult patientswith increasing experience of this disease in adults there have been many atypical cases that have not had the usual constitutional symptoms5 21 22 many infected elderly people may not have fever and the typical respiratory symptoms these silent patients have caused several small outbreaks in other hospitals in hong kong because of the generally mild symptoms a history of household exposure of children to infected adults is the most important clue to the diagnosis of sars there has not been any documented spread of this infection from children to children or children to adults nevertheless such potential cannot be ruled out as in hong kong all infected children were isolated from the onset of their illness prompt early isolation is still mandatory until more information about the infectivity and viral shedding in children is availableup to half of the infected children had normal chest radiographs on presentation19 the finding of unilateral or perihilar air space consolidation is more common in adolescent patients pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy are absent the radiographic findings are no different from those seen in pneumonia due to other aetiologies if the initial chest radiographs are normal thoracic computed tomography may reveal poorly defined ground glass opacifications of the lungs in approximately 20 fig 1
 lymphopaenia and neutrophilia were the most common haematological findings in adult sars patients the counts of cd4-positive and cd8-positive t lymphocytes fell early in the course of illness and these changes were associated with an adverse outcome23 lymphopaenia was also found in almost all paediatric cases but it can also occur in other common viral infections in children thrombocytopaenia and mild elevations of lactate dehydrogenase creatinine phosphokinase and d-dimer were also found in about 10 of paediatric sars patients19 20
typically the course of illness in adults can be divided into three stages24 in the first week patients have fever and mild respiratory symptoms this stage is characterised by active viral replication in the second week many will develop progressive pneumonic changes with increasing oxygen dependency one-quarter of adult patients will develop acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring admission to an intensive care unit the third stage week 3 onward is characterised by gradual recovery in most 80 patients in a review of the first 1425 cases in hong kong the estimated case fatality rate was 132 for patients younger than 60 years old and 433 for patients aged 60 years or older25
the clinical course of the infection in young children is however much less severe many will just have a mild upper respiratory infection most children will become afebrile within 7 days and they do not usually progress to respiratory distress young children will not even require supplemental oxygen pneumonic changes in the chest radiograph usually disappear within 2 weeks there have also been paediatric patients who were asymptomatic but in whom subsequent serological screening confirmed the diagnosis of coronavirus infectionsome adolescent patients may have a slightly more aggressive course with progressive deterioration in the first week or two19 20 there has been no fatality among more than 100 paediatric sars cases in hong kong only one adolescent patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation another adolescent patient was treated with non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation the term sars may therefore not be appropriate in describing the infection in childrenthe optimal medical treatment of sars remains to be determined in contrast to the aggressive regimens used for adults24 only simple supportive care is needed in children with sars as a majority of them do not become very ill for more severely affected adolescents treatment is largely based on the adult experience since there is no known specific anti-viral agent for the sars-associated coronavirus ribavirin has been widely used in treating adult cases in hong kong as revealed by the autopsy results of fatal adult cases the main pathological features in the lungs have been diffuse alveolar damage hyaline membrane formation and scanty interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates4 5 epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage infiltration are other characteristic findings26 it is believed that the lung damage is caused by immunopathological responses to the viral infection anecdotal early experience in adult patients suggested that the combination of systemic corticosteroid and ribavirin appeared to be effective in controlling the disease recent experimental data have however suggested that ribavirin might be ineffective against sars-associated coronavirus27 the use of corticosteroid with this possibly ineffective anti-viral agent in patients with coronavirus pneumonia can be detrimental on the other hand glycyrrhizin extracted from liquorice roots was found to be efficacious in vitro in inhibiting the replication of sars-associated coronavirus27
in the absence of data on the infectivity of paediatric patients we usually keep our infected children in hospital for a total of 3 weeks by that time all patients will be clinically well and their chest radiographs will have become normal preliminary studies in adults suggested that over 50 of patients continued to excrete the virus in stool and urine 3 weeks after the onset of the illness9 because of this finding we instruct patients and their parents on how to handle patients excretions upon discharge on the assumption that their urine and stool may still be infectious more research is however needed to determine the potential infectivity and duration of excretion of the virus from infected childrenmeticulous infection control is the cornerstone in preventing the spread of this disease in the community and the hospital setting the most important route of spread is by close contact droplet transmission in hong kong over 20 of sars patients have been health-care workers in the hospital setting the use of face masks and gowns and hand-washing has been effective in preventing the nosocomial spread of sars among health-care workers28 infected health-care workers must be properly isolated early in the course of illness or they will spread the infection to their family and into the communitysars patients should ideally be managed in hospital on a ward designated solely for the treatment of patients with this infection if single rooms are available these patients should be placed in them with negative-pressure ventilation to prevent cross-infection among patients and health-care workers29 health-care workers should also receive proper training on infection control before they start to take care of sars patients proper isolation facilities droplet precautions hand hygiene protective and disposable gown gloves n95 masks and eye and face shields and contact precaution are necessary to protect health-care workers while managing patients with sars visitors should not be allowed in the wards designated for sars patients to avoid contamination and subsequent cross-infection hospital charts and paperwork should not be placed near the patients resuscitation and endotracheal intubation have been found to carry a very high risk of spreading sars as large amount of infectious aerosol may be generated during these procedures any procedure that generates infectious aerosol such as jet nebulisation and non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation should be avoided2
the exact duration of survival of sars-associated coronavirus in the environment remains unclear but early results from the who laboratory network showed that this virus could survive for at least 1 day in the environment it remained stable in the urine and faeces for up to 4 days30 since a large amount of viral particles can be recovered from stools and urine these clinical samples should be handled as potentially infectious materialswithin only 8 weeks sars spread to all continents of the globe nearly 8500 cases and over 800 deaths have been reported worldwide this infection results in significant morbidity and a high mortality rate in adults for reasons that remain unclear this disease appears to run a much milder clinical course in children although some adolescent patients may develop a slightly more severe illness no fatality among paediatric cases has been reported in hong kong or elsewhere strict infection control is mandatory to prevent nosocomial infection among health-care workers if infected adults are promptly isolated very few children will be affected early case detection the proper isolation of infected patients meticulous infection control in the hospital setting and exhaustive contact-tracing are all important steps in containing this infection although the medical treatment for more severely affected cases remains controversial the majority of children and adolescents will recover with simple supportive measures intensive research is currently underway to develop a rapid and reliable point-of-care diagnostic test until such a test is widely available a history of possible contact with adult sars cases remains the most important clue for paediatricians in making an early presumptive diagnosis in children proper clinical trials are required clearly to define the optimal treatment for sars in both children and adults
a history of close contact with known sars patients is the most important clue to alert paediatricians of the possible diagnosis of sars in childrenthe presenting symptoms of young children infected with sars associated coronavirus are clinically indistinguishable from those of other mild viral upper respiratory tract infectionssimple supportive care is needed in children with sars as a majority of them do not become very illearly case detection proper isolation of infected patients meticulous infection control in the hospital setting and exhaustive contact tracing are the important steps in containing this infection

proper clinical trials clearly to define the optimal treatment for sars in children and adultsmore longitudinal follow up data to determine the potential infectivity and the duration of excretion of the virus from infected childrenfurther studies to determine the reasons why infected children have relatively mild disease when compared with infected adultsthe development of a rapid and reliable point-of-care diagnostic test
the term sars was coined by the world health organisation who in 2003 and stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome in patients with a relevant travelcontact history and severe acute respiratory symptoms

 the outbreak was caused by a novel sars coronavirus sarscov in 2012 another epidemic of novel coronavirus broke out in the middle east region and spread globally and in the winter of 2019 yet another novel coronavirus outbreak occurred this overview aims to compare and contrast the similarities and differences of the these three major episodes of coronavirus epidemics we also aim to highlight the pediatric perspective of these entities which generally has received less attention in current literaturesars is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the sars coronavirus sarscov the origin of sarscov is still unsettled and remains a controversial subject to date sarscov is phylogenetically divergent from other coronaviruses associated with human infections such as oc43 nl63 229e and hku1 but is closely related to civet and bat covs
4
 however none of the currently known bat severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronaviruses sarscov is thought to be the direct ancestor of sarscov
5
 sars was the first severe and readily transmissible new communicable disease of the 21st century
6

the epidemic first started around midnovember 2002 in guangzhou where at least two patients had atypical pneumonia of unknown cause
7
 the initial cases were meat handlers who had regular contact with wild game
4
 shortly after similar cases were reported in five cities in guangdong province however no escalation of public health measures was announced by february 2003 the outbreak had unfolded and there were 305 cases reported with five mortalities
7
 later in the same month the sars outbreak started in hong kong initiated by a physician who traveled from guangzhou to hong kong the virus quickly spread within his admission hospital and into the broader communitybetween november 2002 and july 2003 this outbreak of sars in southern china caused an eventual 8098 cases worldwide resulting in 774 deaths reported in 29 countries with the majority of cases in china and hong kong 96 casefatality rate according to the who
8
 in hong kong 1755 people were infected and 299 died 386 infected cases were healthcare workers and eight of them died
8
 
9
 no case of sars has been reported worldwide since 2004 however suspicious cases were reported from time to time
3

the incubation period for sarscov is between 2 and 10 days with a mean of 5 days and up to 13 days symptoms usually develop 2 to 10 days after the initial infection the immune response includes immunoglobulin m igm antibody to the sarscovthis peaks during the acute or early convalescent phase week 3 and declines by week 12 igg antibody is produced later and peaks at week 12
10

the first symptom of sars is fever of 38c 1004f or higher followed by nonspecific flulike symptoms such as chillsrigor muscle aches and pain headaches diarrhea sore throat runny nose and malaise the symptoms usually last about 2 to 7 days affected patients may develop a dry cough shortness of breath and pneumoniain severe cases the patient can develop respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in the sars outbreak of 2003 about 9 of patients with confirmed sars infection died
11
 the mortality rate was much higher for those over 60 years old with mortality rates approaching 50 for this subset of patients
11

in the sars epidemic there were around 135 pediatric sars cases reported worldwide the majority of them in hong kong
12
 
13
 
14
 
15
 
16
 in pediatric cases the presenting features can be nonspecific hence a postive contact history and environmental exposure became very important diagnostic clues fever was a consistent symptom in all affected children and lasted for a median duration of 6 days while other common symptoms included cough 60 and nausea or vomiting 41
12
 
13
 
17
 teenage patients present with symptoms of malaise myalgia chill and rigor in addition to cough and respiratory symptoms similar to those of adults while the younger children presented mainly with cough and runny nose
13
 the symptoms and clinical course were milder and shorter in young children lymphopenia was an important laboratory finding but more severe among teenagers
13
 the most prominent radiological features included patchy infiltrates opacities and areas of consolidation predominantly in the lower lobes
14

no pediatric mortalities were reported in the literature
12
 in a case series of 43 children with sars in hong kong five required picu care and one patient required invasive ventilatory support
17
 
18
 children who were 12 years of age or younger generally had a milder illness and more favorable outcome
12
 the pathophysiology of a milder disease course in children is not clear and proposed yet putative mechanisms include relatively low dosage of ribavirin shorter course of corticosteroids and a less mature immune system resulting in less autoinflammatory injury in the young
19

followup of sars patients at 6 months after the illness only showed mild residual changes in exercise tolerance and pulmonary function
12
 osteonecrosis was reported in children whose sars treatment included steroids they remained mostly asymptomatic and managed conservatively
16

there were two reported cases of transmission from children to adults and no reports of transmission from children to children
6
 as to vertical transmission in all reported cases of maternal sars during pregnancy the infants survived and no perinatal transmission was detected

in summary respiratory symptoms are milder and nonrespiratory symptoms are present in pediatric patientsmiddle east respiratory syndrome mers is a viral respiratory infection caused by the merscoronavirus merscov like sarscov merscov is a betacoronavirus likely derived from bats with camels as an intermediate host a strain of mershcov known as erasmus medical center emc2012 that was isolated from an infected person in london in 2012 was found to have a 100 match to a virus that affected egyptian tomb bats camels have been shown to have antibodies to merscov and are believed to be involved in its spread to humans but it is still unclear how and to what extend this contributed to the outbreak
20

the first identified case occurred in 2012 in saudi arabia and most cases have occurred in the arabian peninsula
20
 on 22 september 2012 the united kingdom informed who of a case of acute respiratory syndrome with renal failure in a previously healthy 49yearold male qatari national with travel history to saudi arabia and qatar the health protection agency confirmed the presence of a novel coronavirus human betacoronavirus 2c who coined the interim case definition of severe respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus on 25 september which was revised on 29 september to severe acute respiratory infections associated with novel coronavirus infection sari associated with ncov notably the definition of sars for surveillance is not used while the symptoms and viral etiology all fulfilled the sars definition the department of health in hong kong included severe respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus as a statutorily notifiable disease originally named human coronavirus emc2012 the virus was finally given the name middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscovfrom september 2012 to january 2020 who has been informed of a total of 2519 laboratoryconfimed mers cases globally including 858 associated deaths 344 casefatality rate from 27 countries it is not known if this staggering mortality is related to elusive milder cases that had escaped identification cases of mers mainly originated from countries in the middle east and 84 of human cases have been reported in saudi arabia
21
 cases have also been reported in france germany and the united kingdom with all european cases having had a direct or indirect connection to the middle east in france and the united kingdom there had been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the middle east but had been in contact with a traveler who recently returned from the middle east the largest outbreak outside middle east occurred in the republic of korea in 2015 resulting in 186 cases and 39 deaths
21
 no cases of mers have been reported in hong kongthe mean incubation period for merscov is 52 days and ranges from 2 to 13 days symptoms may range from mild to severe and include fever cough diarrhea and shortness of breathspread between humans typically involves close contact with an infected person humantohuman transmission has been limited and mainly among family members and healthcare workers there have been clusters of cases in healthcare facilities where infection prevention and control practices were suboptimal however its spread was uncommon outside of hospitals
20
 
22
 overall 179 of the cases reported were healthcare workers
21
 there have been no reports of sustained humantohuman transmission thus its risk to the global population is currently deemed to be fairly low
20
 the high morbidity associated with mers may be spurious due to bias of inadequate sampling that had missed a much larger denominator with elusive milder cases
23

as of 2019 there was no specific vaccine or treatment for the disease a number of antiviral medications were being studied
20
 the who recommends that those who come in contact with camels wash their hands frequently and not touch sick camels and that camelbased food products should be appropriately cooked in essence symptomatic and supportive treatments constitute therapiesof the cases reported to who 208 had mild to no symptoms while 465 had severe disease or died
21
 mers is typically more severe in those with other health problems more than half of the reported cases had had comorbidities eg diabetes mellitus hypertension heart disease chronic renal failure or lung disease which might explain the high mortality rate
20
 
21
 the overall risk of death may be lower than reported as those with mild symptoms may be undiagnosed
24

the rate of pediatric merscov infection is relatively low in comparison to adults
23
 a large saudi arabian study that screened for merscov by polymerase chain reaction pcr testing in a selected atrisk population including 8032 children 14 years old found 01 who tested positive when compared with 07 in adults
25
 the most common source of infection was household contact and acquired infection within a healthcare facility
26

approximately 42 of affected children are asymptomatic
26
 the most common presenting symptoms are fever 57 vomiting 28 diarrhea 28 and cough 14
26
 the severity is lower in comparison to the adult population in one series of 31 pediatric cases only one patient required intensive care support and there were no deaths
26
 only two fatal pediatric merscov cases were found in the literature and both cases had comorbidities infantile nephrotic syndrome and cystic fibrosis
27

the culprit of the recent pandemic in 2020 termed by the who as coronavirus disease2019 covid19 is yet another novel coronavirus now named sarscov2 the ultimate origin of sarscov2 is believed to be bats with a possible unknown intermediate host possibly pangolins transmitting the virus to humans
28
 
29

in december 2019 a provincial health commission in china reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown cause in wuhan of hubei province the symptom onset date for the first patient identified was 1 december 2019
30
 according to wuhan health officials the pneumonia appeared to be viral in nature and patients were placed in isolation potential causes including influenza avian infleuenza adenovirus sarscov and merscov were ruled out
31
 since there was highly suggestive evidence that the outbreak was associated with exposure in wuhans huanan seafood wholesale market the market was closed on 1 january 2020
32
 from 31 december 2019 to 3 january 2020 a total of 44 cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology from wuhan of hubei province were reported to the who the virus was identified to be a new type of coronavirus on 7 january 2020 thailand reported the first case outside china on 13 january 2020 subsequently cases were reported from other provinces in china japan and south korea the epidemic has since been spreading rapidly and exponentially worldwide the first known serious outbreak outside mainland china happened on the diamond princess cruise ship where more than 700 people were infected and six died the first case in hong kong was confirmed on 22 january 2020 in a patient who returned from wuhan
33
 at the time of writing there are in excess of 36 million confirmed covid19 cases and more than 257 000 deaths globally the casefatality rate being 7
34
 however in the absence of sufficient testing to determine the true levels of morbidity this number should be viewed as an approximationthe mean incubation period for sarscov2 is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days with an average of 5 days
35
 there is evidence of humantohuman transmission through droplets or direct contact and precautions should be practiced in the healthcare settings to prevent airborne transmission which may be underestimated among many uncertainties about this novel virus
36
 there have been confirmed cases in healthcare workers and the reported cases were 38 and 20 of the total confirmed cases in china and italy respectively
31
 
37
 
38
 with the ascertainment of asymptomatic carriage the risk of transmission within the community is very high
39
 the most common symptoms include fever cough dyspnea myalgia or fatigue
30
 in a series of 41 cases only a few patient had prominent upper respiratory tract signs even though abnormalities in chest computed tomography ct images were detected among all patients
30
 ct chest scans have a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of covid19 as compared with pcr swab samples and the findings include bilateral subpleural groundglass opacities with air bronchograms illdefined margins and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe
40
 
41
 indeed ct chest abnormalities are now diagnostic criteria in the latest novel coronavirus diagnosis and treatment plan published by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china
42

in a report of 72 314 cases prepared by the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc a majority 809 of the cases were classified as mild while 47 were critical cases
31
 the age group 80 years old had the highest casefatality rate at 148
31

treatment is mainly supportive as no antiviral treatment has been clinically proven to be effective against sarscov2 and there are no standard treatment guidelines recommended by the who the protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir can be considered but the results of a recent clinical trial are discouraging
43
 remdesivir and chloroquine have been shown to have good inhibitory effect on sarscov2 in vitro
44
 remdesivir is now undergoing phase ii clinical trials in treating patients with covid19
45
 hydroxychloroquine sometimes in combination with azithromycin has been widely used in both europe and the us with little evidence of efficacy and early analyses point to increased risk and higher mortality
46
 
47

longterm outcome for covid19 patients is yet to be determined the guangdong centre of disease control and prevention reported that about 14 of recovered patients were tested postive for sarscov2 in followup checks several weeks after discharge this is deemed most likely due to residual rna in clinical samples rather than reinfection
48
 given that a robust test has yet to be developed speculations about results of the testing include false negativity at the time of discharge inadequate specimen less desirable site of specimen acquisition eg specimen taken from the throat vs the nasopharynx testing discrepancies new tests finding the virus in the lower respiratory tract and reinfectionfortunately infants and children have rarely been involved in the recent covid19 outbreak a systemic review of the literature showed that children accounts for 1 to 5 of diagnosed covid19 cases
49
 in the united states 17 of the reported covid19 cases were under 18 years old while in mainland china and italy 13 of the reported covid19 cases were less than 19 years old
50
 
51
 
52
 contact and travel history are common in a case series of 28 confirmed pediatric patients in china all were either family clusters or had a close contact history
53
 the first reported pediatric case in hong kong was an imported case with a 16yearold boy returning from the diamond princess cruisemost infected children had relatively milder symptoms and recovered within 1 to 2 weeks
53
 several of the patients had no overt clinical symptoms and were found by positive screening of infected close contacts
53
 a study reviewing the epidemiology of 2135 pediatric cases in china revealed the proportion of severe and critical illness to be higher in the younger age group in particular infants
54
 in the report by the us centres for disease control and prevention among the aged less than 1 year with known hospitalized status 62 were hospitalized compared to 41 to 14 among those aged 1 to 17 years
50
 around 2 of the pediatric cases require admission to the intensive care which is low comparing to the adult population
55
 there were less than 10 pediatric deaths reported worldwide
31
 
50

children may play a major role in communitybased viral transmission and there were evidence of covid19 infections in children occurring early in the epidemic
56
 
57
 there is no convincing evidence of vertical transmission to neonates so far with only a couple of studies finding igm in neonatal blood but no viral rna in samples from the respiratory tract
58
 
59
 however early onset covid19 disease in neonates has been reported
60

the reason for the decreased incidence in childhood is yet to be clarified but it has been postulated that children are less susceptible to covid19 because of lesser maturity and function of ace2 receptor the cell entry receptor of sarscov2 compared to adults
61
 
62
 
63

officials and experts compared similarities and differences of the acronyms and believed that they are all novel and impactful syndromes they may have fever respiratory symptoms history of contact or travel an animal vector and a novel coronavirus and significant mortality and morbidity there are relatively minimal or no differences in these acronyms except for the nomenclatures table 1 the fact that a significant number of patients with covid19 are mildly symptomatic vs patients with sars and mers with low mortality rates reflects that sarscov2 resembles other common circulating respiratory viruses however the lack of any population immunity against sarscov2 gives it the ability to cause high attack rates which can overwhelm and cripple healthcare systems if not managed carefullysimilarities and differences between sars mers and covid19 are tabulated hereunder table 1 it is perhaps unnecessary to coin confusing and seemingly different acronyms for each of these recurring epidemics and coronaviruses
1
 
64
 
65
 the virus for covid19 could have been called cov19 or the epidemic caused by sarcov2 as sars19 assuming the next cov epidemic may recur every 8 years in 2027 the epidemic can be called covid27 and the virus cov27 they are often severe always acute and have pneumonia with respiratory tract symptoms among the more severe cases in other words severe acute respiratory syndromes presenting with severe acute respiratory symptoms are here to stay and they are just like sars
3
 
66

the syndrome approach as in sars as opposed to disease approach as in covid has its pros and cons table 2
1
 
67
 health organizations and authorities should provide consistent definitions for index surveillance epidemiological and prognostication studies and refrain from the temptation of coining unnecessary new terminology to describe essentially the same conditions when outbreaks of severe respiratory infection occurs
13
 
65
 travel or contact history is pivotal in formulating management protocol during any outbreak when the pathogen is not initially clear
2
 
68
 history of travel or contact provide important clues to emerging infections as evidenced during coronavirus outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 swine influenza pandemic in 2009 as well as the avian influenza outbreak in 2013 in 2003 the who coined the term sars for severe acute respiratory syndrome in patients with a relevant travelcontact history and pneumonia symptoms any patient in an epidemic area with fever and cough would be diagnosed as sars by who definition in 2003 the clinical features are essentially the same as for any respiratory viral infections or pneumonitis toward the end of the 2003 epidemic sarscov was identified to be the culprit subsequently it was realized that the clinical features of many patients with laboratory sars confirmed by laboratory testing were neither severe nor respiratory in nature nevertheless imprecise definition carries serious public health implications as patients may be erroneously quarantined and cities stigmatized conceptually we could think of the infections as a confluence of factors pathogens viral bacterial exposure travel contact history vector bat camel infectious status exposed but not infected asymptomatic carrier infectious disease syndrome during early phrase of disease as in sars and mers and disease during late stage when the process becomes apparent as in covid19apart from the epidemics and novelty of names these coronavirus are similar in nature and not particularly novel in their clinical presentation lower prevalence of these coronavirus diseases in children might be explained by lower exposure in the pediatric population and as the symptoms are less severe and can even be asymptomatic in children some cases are not diagnosed research to compare the immunopathogenesis of children and adults in responding to sarscov2 infection might lead to discovery of the possible pathogenesis and treatment strategies for these recurrent novel coronavirus diseases if the opportunity to study this is missed during this epidemic we might need to wait for another few years before this mystery can be solvedthe most vulnerable population of the society might be the answer to the treatment of coronaviruslessons to learn in the past 17 years since the first sars outbreak include a coronavirus could cause a major global public health crisis every 8 to 9 years b sars mers and covid19 are overlapping syndromes that may be associated with severe ards and associated with different coronaviruses c pediatric infection by novel coronaviruses is milder and d treatment is primarily symptomatic in nature at the time of writing the most urgent issue at present is to control the covid19 pandemic vaccination could be an answer to this crisis but it is likely to take more than a year to develop and manufacture at scale for the worldwide population as the global battle against the coronavirus continues alertness in personal hygiene mass maskwearing in the community early prompt quarantine vigilant contact tracing surveillance program for testing suspected cases and measures to prevent healthcare related transmission are all the key factors to our success in the global management of coronavirus disease pandemicthis review compares three distinct entities sharing a commonality of a virus the pediatricians view is relief that children are globally far less affected by these infections and the threat is predominantly that asymptomatic children may transmit the virus to vulnerable adults the larger view however is that the current epidemic is by far more concerning in its impact on morbidity and mortality around the globe it stands to reason that some of the pernicious profile of todays pandemic is related to delayed recognition of its magnitude and virulence that allowed for spread that went out of control starting in china and followed by the us however the disturbing questions about this apparent evolution from relatively smallscale epidemics to a global pandemic are whether this has to do with a serendipitous evolution of a virus with inherently more potent infectivity and transmissibility and if so what are the determinants of these characteristics whether beyond the virus there might be environmental changes that have occurred over the twodecade history of these infections that enhance its spread such as rising temperatures or other yet to be determined atmospheric changes it is hoped that because of the devastation that covid19 carries in its wake large efforts will be invested in a search for answers to these questions and with that we will all be able to be wiser in dealing with the threats of the future this will require the combined efforts of a global community since the current events clearly manifested our interconnectedness and interdependence and hence shared vulnerability in the face of a calamity of previously unexperienced magnitudesince late december 2019 there has been an outbreak of a novel enveloped rna betacoronavirus1 called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 which has become an ongoing pandemic the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronaviridae family known to infect humans1 the estimated mortality rate of covid-19 so far is lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome or middle east respiratory syndrome2 however the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is a significant health threat worldwide3 we report an important case in which covid-19 was identified earlier by pneumonia on chest imaging than by clinical symptoms and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr adding this clinical picture of walking pneumonia to surveillance case definitions may limit transmission and contribute toward containment of the disease furthermore enhancing the capability of the covid-19 diagnosis with the use of the chest imaging modality is discusseda 56-year-old chinese woman traveled with her family from wuhan hubei china to thailand for leisure on january 22 2020 four days later and 8 days before her admission her husband was admitted to a private hospital after being diagnosed with covid-19 four days before her admission all the other family members including our patient her two daughters and her three-year-old grandchild were screened for sars-cov-2 from nasopharyngeal and throat swabs using real-time rt-pcr and had negative results figure 1 on the day of her admission she sought health care at our outpatient department because she worried about her condition she denied history of fever and respiratory symptoms physical examination revealed a temperature of 37c a pulse rate of 88 beatsminute a respiratory rate of 20 breathsminute a blood pressure of 10564 mmhg and an oxygen saturation of 98 while breathing room air she had no cyanosis no clubbing no pursed lips expiration no use of accessory respiratory muscles and no nasal flaring auscultation of the thorax was normalthe history of close contact with one covid-19 case and the noticeable cough during the physical examination warranted further investigation her chest radiography cxr revealed an alveolar opacity in the left middle lung field figure 2a thus a diagnosis of pneumonia probably due to covid-19 was made she was admitted to an airborne infection isolation room and empirical treatments were started with ceftriaxone azithromycin and oseltamivir initial blood tests apart from mild leukopenia showed no other abnormalities reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of sputum obtained on day 1 of admission was inconclusive for sars-cov-2 but sputum obtained on day 4 of admission was positive4 furthermore she started to develop sore throat mild cough and diarrhea on day 3 of admission figure 1 antibiotic and antiviral treatments were discontinued because rt-pcr for other respiratory viruses and bacteria from sputum was negative two rectal swabs were negative for sars-cov-2 she continued to receive supportive care and isolation until two consecutive sputum specimens were negative for sars-cov-2 all other family members who were previously screened negative remained asymptomatic but one daughter tested positive for sars-cov-2 she was admitted for treatment and isolation in another hospitala follow-up cxr obtained on day 6 of admission figure 2b showed progression of the opacity in the left middle lung field and of her symptoms of cough sore throat and diarrhea further imaging studies were performed for educational purposes on day 12 after admission when her symptoms were resolved and the sputum rt-pcr was negative on two consecutive specimens chest radiography figure 2c showed improvement of the alveolar opacity in the left middle lung field lung ultrasonography lus figure 2d was found to be positive for b lines and dynamic air bronchogram sign at the posterior part of the left middle lung field a high-resolution computed tomography hrct scan on the same day figure 2e showed a localized subpleural region of ground-glass opacity with superimposed inter- and intralobular septal thickening crazy paving pattern at the supero-posterior segment of the left lower lung lobeduring the initial phase of the covid-19 outbreak thailand implemented temperature and other symptom-based screening of travelers at all points of entry airport ports and ground crossing along with hospital-based surveillance for symptomatic patients since early january 2020 however detection of the disease is complicated by the diversity of symptoms and the severity of disease at the time of presentation this family cluster of cases reflects the real-life situation of screening contact persons and the challenge facing surveillance systems as we expected the snapshot single screening of contacts of confirmed cases might be inadequate for those with prolonged exposure such as in familyhousehold situations continuous symptom-based surveillance self-isolation and other preventative measures have been implemented to all contact persons for 14 days leading to early detection of the subsequent cases the incubation period of the presented case was 8 days which is much longer than the median incubation period of 4 days reported in the literature5 however it was still within the 14 days observation period for contact persons3 to date the disease was confined only to this family and there have been no new transmissions related to this family clusterthe presented case report shows the clinical picture of walking pneumonia in a covid-19 patient whose clinical symptoms did not correlate with the evidence of progressive lung involvement demonstrated by multiple chest imaging modalities this case echoes the latest reports including the outbreak in a family cluster6 which includes the absence of fever at presentation the majority of cases demonstrating mild symptoms5 and the utility of chest imaging to facilitate early identification of the disease even in asymptomatic high-risk contacts7 there is also strong evidence that covid-19 can be transmitted by people who are only mildly ill or even presymptomatic8 therefore apart from symptoms and rt-pcr chest imaging could enhance capabilities for detection of covid-19 pneumonia among patients with covid-19 with mild symptoms similar to the presented casein china computed tomography ct has been an important imaging modality for assisting the diagnosis and management of patients with covid-19 pneumonia79 fang et al9 compared the detection rate of initial chest ct and rt-pcr in 51 eventually confirmed covid-19 cases and reported a higher detection rate for initial ct 98 than first rt-pcr 71 p  000110 on admission the predominant ct findings included ground-glass opacification ggo consolidation bilateral involvement and peripheral and diffuse distributions5 the ct in the present case was performed after symptom resolution and our findings were compatible with the late peak to early absorption stage described in a case series of covid-19 ct findings in 21 confirmed adult chinese patients11 the overuse of ct may cause some drawbacks including higher radiation exposure and the need for transportation which increases the risk of disease spreading furthermore the utility of ct as the standard chest imaging study might be inapplicable for resource-limited settings because the predominant ct pattern observed in covid-19 pneumonia on admission is ggo a cxr is not sensitive to detect this and may demonstrate normal findings in the early stage of infection12 these limitations of both ct and cxr lead to the possibility of using lus at the bedside as a screening and monitoring tool it is noninvasive and can be performed at the bedside for those in isolation or in intensive care thus limiting the risk of spreading the disease compared with transferring patients to ct lung ultrasonography is also more readily available in low- to middle-income countries but does need to be performed by trained medical personnel with special precaution further research is needed to address the utility of lus in a diagnostic pathway for patient selection for ct and to explore the application of artificial intelligence in screening chest radiographs in suspected casesin conclusion we report a symptomatically mild covid-19 case presenting as walking pneumonia in which the early diagnosis and management was achieved in the presymptomatic stage by the use of chest imaging studiesa cluster of viral pneumonia cases emerged in china in december 2019 secondary to a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 the clinical spectrum of disease appears wide and encompasses asymptomatic infection and mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe viral pneumonia leading to respiratory failure or even death 2 the world health organisation named the resulting pneumonic disease coronavirus disease covid-19 and declared a pandemic on 12th march 2020 published case series have listed fever 98 cough 76 myalgiafatigue 44 and dyspnea 55 as common presenting symptoms in covid-19 23 diarrhoea 35 was a rare presentation in the early case series 23 however clinicians have begun to question whether the prevalence of diarrhoea as a symptom of covid-19 is underestimated 4 gathering and disseminating information on the range of clinical presentations of this novel viral illness is vital to enable prompt diagnosis case isolation and treatment delays in diagnosis and case isolation in particular add to the public health challenge of covid-19 enabling virus transmission therefore we discuss a case of confirmed covid-19 presenting with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms in the united kingdom ukinformed consent for this case report was given by the patient he was a 74-year-old man with a past medical history of quiescent ulcerative colitis and hypertension he took amlodipine 5 mg for hypertension but took no regular medications for his ulcerative colitis and had never required immunomodulator therapy or surgery the patient had not had a flare of his ulcerative colitis in over 15 years he was independent with his activities of daily living and lived with his wife the patient was first hospitalized in early march 2020 with a 3-day history of diarrhoea and vomiting following a trip 7 days prior to scotland no other family members were symptomatic he complained of passing liquid brown stool and vomiting up to three times a day at the point of admission he had no further diarrhoea or vomiting episodes for the prior 24 h on direct questioning he denied any respiratory symptoms and his chest x-ray revealed no radiological abnormalities he remained apyrexial and his oxygen saturations were 96 on air his blood results across his two admissions are summarized in table 1 but of note he was hyponatremic at 122 mmoll when he first presented to hospital he was admitted to a side room and rehydrated with intravenous 09 saline over 8 h and discharged within 24 h once his sodium had risen 125 mmoll with planned regular outpatient monitoring of his electrolytesthe patient was re-admitted 72 h later with mild delirium and functional decline along with further intermittent loose stools and vomiting the patient was spending most of the day in bed with symptoms of lightheadedness and fatigue his appetite had decreased the patient now reported a dry cough and described feeling feverish the patient was admitted to a side room and a swab was sent for viral pcr forty-eight hours later sars-cov-2 viral rna was detected and the patient was transferred to a covid-19 cohort ward the remainder of his respiratory viral screen was negative he did not have any diarrhoea in hospital therefore no samples for norovirus routine culture or calprotectin were sent local guidelines do not advocate sending stool for sars-cov-2 rna testing only 55 of stool samples are positive for sars-cov-2 rna in patients with confirmed covid-19 disease and there is no correlation between a detection of rna in the stool and gastrointestinal symptoms 5 of note the patient never required oxygen therapy despite reporting feeling feverish no objective fever was recorded during either admission furthermore his lymphocyte count and platelet count were within the normal range on both admissions and his crp peaked at 21 mgl table 1 he was placed on a 15 l fluid restriction and his sodium normalized within 3 days he was discharged after a 72-h inpatient stay and he has subsequently made a full recovery the symptom constellation of diarrhoea and vomiting followed by the development of a dry cough in the context of a positive swab for sars-cov-2 led us to believe his entire presentation was covid-19 diseaseit is understandable that early case series from china focused on the respiratory symptoms associated with covid-19 given that the most severe disease can cause respiratory failure and death however since they did not highlight diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal gi symptoms as presenting features of covid-19 these symptoms may have been and continue to be under-recognized as evidenced by our case report this knowledge gap can lead to a delay in diagnosis and will increase the opportunity for viral transmission to other people including healthcare workersin contrast to those early reports 17 of patients in a singapore case series reported diarrhoea 6 additionally more recent analysis of the clinical features of 204 patients presenting across hubei province in china during february 2020 identified that one in five patients reported either vomiting diarrhoea or abdominal pain at presentation 7 however most patients also reported respiratory symptoms and presented with a fever only six out of 204 patients presented with gi symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms and only one patient presented with gi symptoms without fever therefore our case not only highlights the importance of recognizing gi symptoms in covid-19 but also highlights the potential for cases to present with predominantly gi symptoms alone our case also suggests that gi symptoms are likely to be present in western populations where the disease has been present for a shorter time period and is therefore less comprehensively described at the time of writingit is postulated the sars-cov-2 binds to host ace2 receptors on target cells to gain entry 8 and ace2 is highly expressed in human small intestine 4 ace2 is a regulator of intestinal inflammation and can be associated with an increased risk of colitis 9 therefore there is a plausible biological mechanism through which sars-cov-2 could cause diarrhoea and other gi symptoms given the variable disease progression and time course in covid-19 it is likely that over time the true aetiology of diarrhoea will prove multifactorial the delayed focus on gi symptoms compared with respiratory symptoms is consistent with descriptions of other novel coronavirus diseases for example diarrhoea was subsequently recognized as a symptom of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection following initial descriptions which focused on respiratory complaints 10it has long been recognized within geriatric medicine that older people with any illness may present atypically some of the commonest atypical presentations of systemic illness are delirium functional decline and falls 1112 since acute illness leads to decompensation of pre-existing medical conditions in our case in addition to the gastrointestinal symptoms we saw a mild delirium functional decline and a pattern of electrolyte disturbances consistent with syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone it is currently unknown if older adults with covid-19 present differently to younger patients and our patient was over 20 years older than the average age of the patient cohort from hubei province 7 to date most triage of potential cases of covid-19 has been based upon the presence of respiratory symptoms however given we know that older adults are less likely to develop fever or typical symptoms with other respiratory viral illnesses such as influenza 1314 there is an urgent need to properly describe the spectrum of clinical features in this patient groupit is therefore imperative that as geriatricians we use our expertise to maintain a high index of suspicion of covid-19 in any older patient presenting to hospital as an emergency high quality uk studies of older people are required to ascertain the prevalence of gi symptoms and any other non-respiratory presentations which may be consistent with covid-19novel coronavirus pneumonia refers to pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov infection on february 11 2020 the world health organization who named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus infection as covid-19 on february 22 2020 the national health commission announced that the english name of the novel coronavirus pneumonia was covid-19 1 because covid-19 is highly contagious and the population is generally susceptible early diagnosis and early isolation and treatment are of great significance for disease prognosis and epidemic control at present covid-19 virus nucleic acid positivity or viral gene sequencing positivity is an important basis for diagnosis however chest ct as the most commonly used imaging examination for respiratory diseases has an irreplaceable role in the detection and evaluation of covid-19 2 this study dynamically observed the imaging characteristics of patients who were infected with covid-19 from the onset of clinical symptoms until recovery we also assessed some laboratory indexes of patients to provide a reference for the clinical diagnosis and management of covid-19clinical records of inpatients and severe patients in the third pneumonia ward in xishui county peoples hospital of huanggang city which was taken over by shandong medical team of hubei province were retrospectively reviewed from january 25 2020 to march 10 2020 including age gender clinical history laboratory test results and chest ct imaging data patients were diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan trial version 6 a total of 44 patients  27 males 614 and 17 females 386  with complete ct imaging data were includedchest ct scans were conducted using anke anatom 32-row spiral ct scanners patients wore masks during the entire examination protective measures were taken for the scanning technicians as required after patients were placed in a supine position with arms raised and advanced head continuous spiral scanning was performed from the lung apex to lung bottom during a single breath-holding of the patient the tube voltage was 120 kv with automatic tube current modulation or 160 ma the layer thickness was 7 mm and section thickness was 1 mm for reconstructionspatient age gender epidemiological history and clinical symptoms eg fever cough chest tightness and fatigue were recorded by reviewing the medical records the interval between the onset of symptoms and first ct scans was calculated the images were reviewed independently by an experienced radiologist and a clinician and the results of the lesion site number shape density border pleural effusion and hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes on each ct examination were recorded disagreements during the evaluation were resolved by discussion and consensus we also assessed and recorded some laboratory indicators of

recorded into microsoft excel for mac version 1630 and analyzed spss version 210 spss inc chicago il usa was used for statistical analysis count data were assessed using the chi-square test and p005 was considered statistically significanta total of 44 patients  27 males 614 and 17 females 386  diagnosed with covid-19 were included with an average age of 508 2775 years there were 40 patients 895 who had a history of living traveling or being in close contact with confirmed covid-19 patients 2 patients 53 personally denied contact history 2 patients 53 had unknown contact history 2 patients had a previous history of hypertension and diabetes and 2 patients had a previous history of hypertension fever 864 and cough 795 were the main symptoms and other symptoms were chest tightness 250 fatigue 159 and diarrhea 53 the basic manifestations and dynamic changes of the time course between the onset of clinical symptoms and ct scan are displayed in table 1 and figure 1 respectively the lesions were scattered in both lungs in multiple peripheral areas of the lung field and on the dorsal sideat 16 days after onset scattered and multiple lesions were observed in both lungs in 33 patients 750 3 patients had 4 lung lobes involved 3 patients had 3 lobes involved 3 had 2 lobes involved and only 2 had involvement of a single lobe in the early stage 13 days 21 100 patients presented with patchy wedge-shaped fan-shaped round or irregular ground-glass lesions some of which had the long axis parallel to the adjacent pleura figure 2 three patients 143 presented with sub-solidified ground-glass-like shadows with uneven density and 11 524 showed reticular interlobular septal thickening at 46 days 9 patients 409 had disease progression which was characterized by increased ground-glass shadows enlargement increased density patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation partial fusion and reticular interlobular septal thickening and the remaining 13 were patients who received the first ct examination in 20 patients 556 lesions had progressed at 79 days and the lesions were absorbed in 7 patients 194 showing shrinking and reduced lesions reduced lesion density blurred edges and fibrous cord shadow there were 13 patients 464 with disease progression from 10 to 12 days and lesions were absorbed in 14 patients 500 the lesions were progressed in 5 patients 139 and absorbed in 31 patients 861 from 13 to 15 days one patient 31 had disease progression on the 17th day and 31 had better absorption from 16 to 18 days in the 19-day ct re-examination 36 cases of lesions had further shrinkage reduction and density became lighter but the absorption of lesions was slower than in the earlier stage among which 4 cases were slightly absorbed and the re-examination showed that fibrous cord-like shadows disappeared in 2 cases figure 3 small amount of pleural effusion was detected in 1 case and no enlarged lymph nodes were noticed in the hilar mediastinumlaboratory observation indicators showed the following white blood cell count was increased in 2 cases 45 within normal range in 23 cases 523 and decreased in 19 cases 432 17 cases 386 had decreased lymphocyte count and 29 cases had decreased lymphocyte ratio 659 31 cases 705 had increased esr 40 cases 909 had increased c-reactive protein 36 cases 818 had decreased prealbumin 39 cases 886 had decreased total protein albumin was decreased in 16 cases 364 globulin was decreased in 33 cases 750 fibrinogen was increased in 35 cases 795 and d-dimer was increased in 24 cases 545statistical analysis of patients ct images showed that the progression and absorption of lesions were significantly different at different time periods p005 the ct scans showed that the disease progressed from the clinical symptoms to 79 days and the lesions began to be absorbed at 1315 daysas a highly contagious disease covid-19 is mainly transmitted via droplets and contact in a relatively closed environment covid-19 can be transmitted through aerosol for a long time and patients in the incubation period and asymptomatic virus carriers are also infectious 23 the incubation period is generally 114 days and most show symptoms 37 days after infection there are very few cases in which the incubation period exceeds 14 days and the longest can reach 24 days 4 fever cough and fatigue are the main clinical manifestations of covid-19 in the early stage a few patients present with other symptoms such as nasal congestion runny nose sore throat myalgia and diarrhea the clinical manifestations of the 44 patients in this group in which 38 had fever 864 and 35 had cough 795 are in line with other studies at present the diagnostic criteria are mainly based on real-time fluorescent rt-pcr of respiratory specimens or blood specimens to detect novel coronavirus nucleic acid-positive or viral gene sequencing which are highly homologous with known novel coronaviruses although the detection of novel coronavirus in respiratory specimens by rt-pcr can generally obtain results within 46 hours 5 various factors can ultimately affect the accuracy of nucleic acid detection results and false-negative results can occur recently a study compared the sensitivity of rt-pcr and ct in covid-19 detection among 1014 patients and found that 59 had positive rt-pcr results while 88 had positive chest ct scans suggesting that the sensitivity of ct was 97 based on positive rt-pcr results in detection of covid-19 6 researchers recently found that in use of ct and nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of covid-19 there are more factors that cause false-negative results during nucleic acid detection 7 therefore chest ct is an important supplementary tool for rt-pcr in the diagnosis of covid-19 and has irreplaceable significancechest hrct is currently the imaging method used for screening covid-19 covid-19 can be divided into 4 stages according to ct scans of the lungs the evolution of the lesions and the imaging performance in overlap of different stages 812 in the early stage commonly within 1 week of onset single or multiple lesions were mostly noticed in the periphery of the lungs or under the pleura with progression of disease the ggo density gradually increased and thickened small blood vessel shadows or local lobular septum thickening were seen there are multiple lesions in advanced stage which are manifested by increased ggo partial fusion or accompanied by consolidation gradually increasing density and bilateral asymmetric subpleural distribution for the severe stage critical illness which is equivalent to the terminal stage of the disease bilateral lung lesions showed diffuse and extensive further progression and some of them present as white lung the lesions developed rapidly becoming solid and combined with ggo bronchial inflation signs can be seen which can increase by more than 50 in 48 hours during the transition period the density of the lesions decreased shrank or were absorbed and fibrous cord-like shadows were seen in some casesthe 44 patients observed in this study received timely and effective treatment without severe deterioration or death however during the entire diagnosis and treatment process the patients chest ct results changed dynamically with evolution of the disease there have been reports of dynamic changes of ct manifestations in china 1314 because there is often a certain time interval between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization unlike previous observations the time of appearance of a patients first symptoms was defined by carefully consulting the relevant case data in our study the basic manifestations and dynamic changes of clinical symptoms and different ct scan intervals were observed and analyzed for the first time this study showed that the early manifestations of the disease were mainly ggo which represents acute tissue damage with the development of the disease ggo can be increased enlarged and partially fused and a few lesions can also be directly absorbed which is basically consistent with the most common conclusion of previous studies 13 that ggo is found 25 days after admission with the further development of the disease ggo gradually decreased consolidation lesions gradually increased and the density of most lesions gradually increased unevenlyin the course of disease improvement consolidation was gradually absorbed density decreased unevenly scope was reduced and edge was unclear some lesions may have fibrous cord shadow which can appear from the beginning of absorption and shows a gradually increasing trend with the continuous review of ct absorption decreased we observed that the fibrous cord shadow was gradually reduced and the edge gradually became clearer or even completely disappeared in 2 patients the cord shadow partially disappeared after 19 days this may be related to the exudative component of the lesion which can be further observed in subsequent follow-up reviews during the dynamic observation of the outcome of the disease we found that the disease progressed significantly at 49 days was most significant at 79 days 556 then disease progressed slowly at 1012 days and the absorption of the lesions become apparent and the absorption of the lesions was obvious at 1315 days 861 these results differ from a previous study 13 reporting that patients with lung lesions progressed most obviously at days 69 of admission and the absorption was more obvious at 1014 days this may be because our data were based on the onset time if the time from symptom onset to hospital admission is excluded the above conclusions are basically consistentas in previous studies we assessed decreased white blood cell and lymphocyte counts as well as increased c-reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate fibrinogen and d-dimer 215 c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevation often appeared in the early and middle stages of covid-19 disease progression the imaging manifestations were mainly ground-glass-like high-density shadows and consolidation shadows c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate returned to normal range in the terminal stage in some patients perhaps due to the rapid increase of crp and the acceleration of esr when human tissue being inflamed and infected in the early and middle stages however in the late stage inflammation and infection were gradually controlled and the absorption and density of lung lesions were decreased a recent study indicated remarkably higher esr and crp levels in covid-19 patients than in healthy controls 16 ma et al 17 showed that the ct score was proportional to the onset time and crp according to the ct performance score which was also consistent with our results a decrease in the lymphocyte ratio was also observed in this group of data previous studies 17 used a semi-quantitative description of chest ct involvement and showed a negative correlation between ct score and lymphocyte count in the present study the relationship between lymphocyte count and imaging performance was not further observed and will be further improved in subsequent studies results of prealbumin total protein albumin and globulin indicated that most patients experienced a decrease in albumin during the onset of disease only part of the patients albumin recovered to the normal range at the later stage of absorption so far no relevant report has been found on this topic the possible causes are vascular endothelial damage and capillary leakage caused by virus infection or anorexia resulting in reduced nutrition intake the catabolism of the body greater than the anabolism resulting in the negative nitrogen balance of the body or respiratory symptoms such as cough expectoration and other systemic diseases like low fever resulting in increased consumption the specific causes need to be further exploredthe present study is the first to use the time of appearance of clinical symptoms and the interval between each ct scan as observation nodes at the same time some fibrous cord shadows could be absorbed and the ratio of lymphocytes and protein series in laboratory examinations were reduced to varying degrees the limitations of this study are that the sample size was small and the mechanism for the absorption of fibrous cord-like shadows and the abnormality of some laboratory indicators have not been further analyzed there are many factors that affect the imaging performance and laboratory tests such as drugs used and underlying diseases which will be further addressed in future studieslung ct scans can fully display the distribution morphology and density changes and dynamic changes of outcomes of patients with covid-19 during the process of the disease clinical manifestations combined with laboratory indicators of patients can help guide early clinical diagnosis early isolation and early treatment of covid-19 and can be regarded as a basis for evaluating the therapeutic effect of comprehensive clinical treatmentsince december 2019 a large number of novel coronavirus 2019-ncov pneumonia cases have been reported in wuhan the capital of hubei province and a large city of approximately 11 million persons located in the central region of the peoples republic of china 1 this newly recognized -coronavirus causes covid-19 which has rapidly spread throughout china and has crossed international borders owing to human-to-human transmission of the virus via intercontinental travel 2 as of 2400 february 4 2020 a total of 24324 covid-19 cases in china have been confirmed 3 during pregnancy the mothers body undergoes a variety of changes which include changes in anatomy bodily functions and immune status thus resulting in an immunosuppressive state the newly discovered 2019-ncov is a large number of people are susceptible to the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 it is known that 2019-ncov can infect pregnant women such women are more susceptible to covid-19 and the disease can cause potential maternal and fetal complications 3 therefore increased attention should be given to covid-19 patients who are pregnant unfortunately there is limited experience with covid-19 during pregnancy in addition there have been no reports on the imaging manifestations of covid-19 during pregnancy in china or other countries according to diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia for novel coronavirus infection trial version 5 of the national health commission images of 2019-ncov pneumonia showed rare pleural effusion 1 however covid-19 in pregnancy is often found to be associated with pleural effusion in this study a retrospective analysis was conducted using the clinical data and computerized tomographic ct images of the chest of pregnant women with covid-19 treated in our hospital from january 20 2020 to february 6 2020 the generated data was summarized to improve the understanding and diagnosis of covid-19 in pregnancywe did a retrospective review of medical records of ten pregnant women with covid-19 admitted to the zhongnan hospital of wuhan university from january 20 2020 to february 6 2020 diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia was based on the new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program 5th edition published by the national health commission of china six pregnant women with covid-19 pneumonia tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 based on the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr analysis of the samples from the respiratory tract the other four cases were clinically diagnosed according to diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia for novel coronavirus infection trial version 5 this study was reviewed and approved by the medical ethical committee of zhongnan hospital of wuhan university approval number 2020037 written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patientmaternal throat swab samples were collected and tested for sars-cov-2 using the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc recommended kit biogerm shanghai china following who guidelines for qrt-pcr 4 all samples were processed simultaneously at the department of clinical laboratory of zhongnan hospital and state key laboratory of virologyinstitute of medical virology school of basic medical sciences wuhan university positive cases of covid-19 infection were defined as those with a positive test result from either laboratorythe average age of the patients included in this study was 30 years range 26 to 40 years gestational age ranged from 361 to 394 weeks with a median age of 373 weeks the median onset time ranged from 1 to 10 days with 6 days on median the symptoms included fever n  8 with the body temperature ranging from 375 c to 383 c dry cough n  5 nasal congestion n  1 and paroxysmal abdominal distension and diarrhea n  1 of the two patients who did not have fever one had cough with little mucus and sputum and the other was hospitalized due to abdominal distention and diarrhea pregnancy complications were reported in two patients one with gestational diabetes mellitus and the other with hypothyroidism laboratory examination showed that white blood cell count was normal in nine patients and slightly higher in one patient 1023  109 the lymphocyte ratio was decreased by 12 and 14 in two patients the levels of c-reactive protein crp was elevated in seven patients range 2116603 mgl while the levels of d-dimer were increased in eight patients range 5072141 ngml the total protein level was low in six patients range 353565 mgl hypersensitive troponin was increased in one patient 778 pgml a summary of the various signs and symptoms of the ten pregnant women with covid-19 are shown in table 1ct scans were performed using siemens 64 and philips 64 ct scanners the ct protocol used was as follows tube voltage  120kv automatic tube current pitch  10 section thickness  0625 mm interval  50 mm axial reconstruction thickness  0625 mm matrix 512  512 the following windows were used a lung window with a window width of 1000 hu and a window level of -600 hu and a mediastinal window with a window width of 300 hu and a window level of 40 hutwo senior radiologists reviewed the images independently mainly observing the distribution morphology density and dynamic changes in lesions including pleural effusion and mediastinal lymph node in case of discrepancy a conclusion was reached by consensus all patients signed informed consent before ct examination for all pregnant women included in this study the abdomen was protected with lead and the ct dose was 411 mgylymphadenopathy was defined as a lymph node 1 cm in short-axis diameterthe ct findings of the patients included in this study are shown in table 2distribution analysis showed the presence of lesions in one lung of two patients 20 one right and one left lung lesions in both the lungs were observed in eight patients 80 there were seven patients 70 who had lesions distributed in the upper lobes nine patients 90 with lesions distributed in the middle lobe lingular segment and ten patients 100 with lesions distributed in the lower lobe ten patients 100 had lesions distributed in the peripheral region of the lungs and four patients 40 had lesions distributed in the non-peripheral regionmorphology analysis showed that there were six patients 60 with patchy shadow and nine patients 90 with small patchy shadowdensity analysis showed that there were ten 100 patients with pure ground glass opacity ggo amongst which six 60 had ggo accompanied by consolidation fig 1 one 10 had ggo accompanied by reticular andor interlobular septal thickening and 4 40 showed signs of intra-bronchial air-bronchogram fig 2 six patients 60 had small bilateral pleural effusions fig 3 while no patient had lymphadenopathy dynamic changes and prognosis of lesions were analyzed during the study chest ct follow-up examination was performed in four patients two patients showed improvement in symptoms with a lighter density of the lesion and reduction in the area of the lesions fig 4a and 4b 1 patient showed normal on the initial examination and a small patchy ggo with signs of intra-bronchial air-bronchogram observed in the left upper lobe after 3 days of observation fig 5a and 5b one patient showed progressive disease after 7 days of observation with expansion in lesion area increase in density and appearance of linear opacity fig 6a and 6b all newborn pharyngeal swabs were tested twice for novel-coronavirus nucleic acid and were found to be negativethe ct findings of ten pregnant women with covid-19 were as follows 1 60 of patients had small bilateral pleural effusion which was not in line with the previous reports which indicated that pleural effusion is rare in covid-19 5 pleural effusion may be associated with either covid-19 or pregnancy status this may be attributed to the following reasons a the total protein levels in these six patients had decreased to varying degrees ranging from 353 mg to 565 mgl and a small amount of pleural effusion might have been caused by the decrease in plasma colloid osmotic pressure due to slight hypoproteinemia b the crp levels were elevated in all the six patients ranging from 211785603 mgl thus indicating certain inflammatory reactions the infection might have caused thickening and congestion of the visceral pleura and increased vascular permeability resulting in induction of pleural effusion the gradient movement of exudate across the visceral pleura in a gradient might have resulted in pleural effusion 6 c all the patients in this group were women with late pregnancy at 3638 weeks of gestation and late pregnant women are prone to chest leakage due to increased blood volume 2 all the ten patients included in this study were in the early or progressive stages of covid-19 and there was no patient in critical stage six cases 60 were in early stage based on ct images two patients 20 showed single small patchy ggo in one lobe and four patients 40 showed multiple patchy ggo in the periphery of both the lungs among them one patient showed normal in the first ct scan which was consistent with the atypical covid-19 performance reported by chung m et al 7 the other four patients 40 were in the progressive stage showing multiple small or large patchy ggo in both the lungs some lesions were consolidated with signs of intra-bronchial air-bronchogram this was consistent with the characteristics of early and mid-stage lesions reported by song f et al 8 the lesions were commonly distributed in both the lungs with multiple lobes n  8 which was different from bacterial pneumonia and consistent with the report of shi hs et al 9 covid-19 is difficult to differentiate from sars mers and other diseases based on ct images it is thus necessary to combine epidemiology and pathogenic examination for efficient diagnosis of covid-19 in pregnant womensimilar to sars-cov and mers-cov the sars-cov-2 is caused by a  coronavirus the similarity between the 2019-ncov and sars-cov genomes was reported to be as high as 85 over the past 20 years sars and mers have caused a total of more than 10000 patient infections worldwide with a fatality rate of sars at 10 sars in pregnant women at 25 and mers at 37 3 10 according to the latest report the fatality rate of covid-19 is 43 11 a vast majority of the population is susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 in pregnancy may occur at all gestational ages 12 the inflammatory stress response in pregnant women to viral pneumonia increases significantly resulting in rapid development of the disease especially in the middle and late stages of pregnancy which are prone to severe illness and may cause maternal-fetal death 13 at present the diagnosis of covid-19 depends on nucleic acid testing and in clinical practice there are a few cases of pregnant women with negative 2019-ncov nucleic acid testing however there have been cases of pregnant women who had a history of contact with covid-19 patients and have typical clinical imaging manifestations of covid-19 during this time chest imaging examination especially ct has important reference value for the diagnosis and treatment dynamic evaluation of covid-19 in pregnancyin the early stage of embryonic development high dose exposure of radiation 1 gy can be fatal to the embryo however the dose of diagnostic imaging in this study was much lower than 1 g in addition radiation exposure at 8 to 15 weeks of gestation has the greatest impact on the central nervous system of the fetus and some scholars suggest that the lowest dose of exposure that can cause mental retardation of the fetus is above 610 mgy 148 according to the american radiological association and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists the fetal radiation dose in pregnant women undergo a single chest x-ray examination is 00005 to 001 mgy in case of chest ct or ct pulmonary angiography 01 to 10 mgy the fetus exposure dose is 001  066 mgy 8 therefore for pregnant women suspected of sars-cov-2 infection ct or x-ray scans can be used for chest examinationafter analyzing the diagnosis and treatment process ct has the following diagnostic value for covid-19 in pregnancy 1 cases with strong occult and atypical symptoms can be detected in this study a 33-year-old pregnant woman at 362 weeks gestation had abdominal distention and diarrhea as the first symptom but no fever dry cough or other symptoms routine outpatient blood examination showed a decrease in lymphocyte ratio and an increase in the level of d-dimer the patient had a history of contact with covid-19 patients and the chest ct showed multiple small patchy of ggo lesions involving both the lungs indicating viral pneumonia and the novel coronavirus nucleic acid testing showed positive results 2 the scope degree and therapeutic effect of the lesions can be rapidly evaluated in this group four patients underwent follow-up ct re-examination at follow-up pulmonary involvement was improved in 2 patients with smaller lesion size and lighter lesion density these two patients did not terminate pregnancy during treatment disease progression was observed in 2 patients with an increased size andor increased consolidation these patients opted for cesarean to terminate the pregnancy which improved the maternal and fetal outcomes and avoided maternal and fetal death 3 the nucleic acid testing false negative patients could be identified which is conducive to early diagnosis early quarantine and early treatment one patient was admitted to hospital due to fever and cough for 2 days her husband was diagnosed with covid-19 three days ago and had close contact with her chest ct showed small patchy ggo in the left lingular segment and the right lower lobe while the novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative which was in accordance with diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia for novel coronavirus infection trial version 5 and was consistent with the clinical diagnosis 4 ct examination is quick and only takes a few minutes while the number of nucleic acid test kits is limited which is time-consuming and may result in false negatives 5 chest ct reexamination is one of the main indicators of discharge therefore ct of covid-19 in pregnancy is conducive to early control of the source of infection it plays an important role in early detection early reporting monitoring dynamic changes and detection of complicationsthere are a few limitations to our study first the group of pregnant women with covid-19 included in this study were in their third trimester of pregnancy there is still no understanding of pregnant women with covid-19 in early and mid-term pregnancy further the number of confirmed cases is relatively small and we will further accumulate and summarize data for related researchin conclusion this study suggested that covid-19 in pregnancy was mainly occurs in the early and progressive stages based on ct images chest ct scans showed small patchy or patchy ggo distributed in the peripheral zone of both the lungs with partial consolidation a sign of intra-bronchial air-bronchogram and was accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusion thus ct scan plays an important role in early screening of patients with atypical symptoms andor negative nucleic acid testing and dynamic observation and efficacy evaluation of suspected or confirmed patients with covid-19coronaviruses constitute a group of single-stranded rna viruses that cause respiratory hepatic enteric and neurological illness the severity of symptoms is highly variable and the range of animal species affected is broad including humans 13 in general coronaviruses are classified into four major genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus cov gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus 3 4 over the last two decades two novel cov strains caused severe human illness 5 6 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov both strains were associated with high morbidity and mortality rates and the lack of successful treatmentsin december 2019 the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan china corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 has since become a worldwide pandemic with high rates of mortality 79 the sequence pathogenesis and cellular entry mechanisms of the sars-cov-2 are similar to those of the sars-cov 1012 the major clinical manifestations of sars-cov-2 infection are respiratory due to pulmonary complications 1317 symptoms can be mild including fever headache cough dyspnea and myalgia or severe such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which sometimes develops about 1 week into the illness and may result in death 79 1317 central nervous system cns complications of covid-19 infection have not been systematically investigated or analyzedthe neurotropism potential of coronaviruses was demonstrated in previous studies 10 18 for example sars-cov is believed to enter the brain primarily via the olfactory bulb resulting in rapid infection with transneuronal spread and minimal cellular infiltration 19 this may cause neural dysfunction especially at the cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla as was demonstrated in mice transgenic for human ace2 20considering the above we screened the available literature regarding possible neurological manifestations and complications of coronaviruses in general and of the recent sars-cov-2 specifically table 1 summarizes human manifestations of sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses in the cns below we describe the evidence of cns disorders that have been linked with coronavirusesmultiple sclerosis ms is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the cns the immune reactions involved in ms are attributed to both genetic and environmental factors 37 38 a possible link between coronaviruses and demyelinating disorders including ms has been reported 3941 coronavirus strains were suggested to initiate immunopathogeneic events leading to cns demyelination some strains were even proposed as an experimental model for ms to further study the mechanisms of virus-induced demyelination 4244 in animals the murine coronavirus jhm was demonstrated to cause demyelination 45 the ability of coronaviruses to produce demyelination in experimentally infected mice has led to studies that investigate the possibility of human coronaviruses in ms brain tissues interestingly nucleic acids of the human coronavirus 229e strain were detected in the cns tissue of four of eleven ms patients indicating neurotropism of the 229e strain 46 moreover coronavirus-like particles under electron microscopy were found in autopsies from two ms patients 47 murray et al 48 demonstrated that direct intracerebral administration of coronaviruses might cause demyelinating disease in primates using in situ hybridization they detected coronavirus rna sequences in the brain and in demyelinating plaques in 12 of 22 ms patients 49 in contrast other studies that used polymerase-chain-reaction pcr with specific primers for the two human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 did not show any difference between the ms and the control groups in coronaviral rna detection in brain tissues 41 50 moreover antigenic assessment by comparing levels of coronavirus antibodies failed to support the claim of coronaviruses as an etiology for ms this is because no significant differences were found between samples of ms patients and control subjects 51multiple mechanisms were proposed to explain demyelination by coronaviruses in animal models jhm virus-induced demyelination was largely correlated with cytopathogenic properties of the virus for oligodendrocytes 52 the molecular basis of this process was linked to the e2 sub-region 45 additional mechanisms subsequently emerged one of them involves molecular mimicry between coronaviruses and myelin as a basis for the autoimmune reaction leading to cross-reactivity of t-cells 53 54 furthermore rna recombination demonstrated that the s gene of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv is related to certain molecular aspects of demyelination this indicates the potential role of viral envelope s glycoproteins in autoimmune-induced demyelination 43 mutations in the spike glycoprotein of human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 modulated the disease from chronic encephalitis to flaccid paralysis and demyelination 55 other studies emphasized the importance of t cells especially cd8 in the process of demyelination in mice infected with coronaviruses 56 57 accordingly gamma-interferon was shown to lead to demyelination mediated by cd8 cells nevertheless kim et al showed that the specific antibodies against the coronavirus jhm in animal models were sufficient to induce demyelination in the absence of t cells they also showed that the destruction of myelin in these cases resulted from the complement system as well as from fc receptor-dependent mechanisms 58 59 additional mechanisms related to chemokines like cxcl10 and chemokine receptor ccr5 were also described 60 61coronaviruses have been associated with other demyelinating pathologies like acute or subacute disseminated encephalomyelitis adem in humans 31 62 adem is a rare acute inflammatory demyelinating disease that may follow viral infections intracerebral inoculation of the human coronavirus hcov-oc43 into balbc mice caused acute encephalitis with cellular death by necrosis and apoptosis 63 several months of follow-up of viral rna led to the conclusion that viral persistence could be associated with increased neuronal degeneration resulting in neuropathology and motor deficits in line with these experimental findings in a child who presented with adem cerebrospinal fluid csf tested positive for hcov-oc43 using pcr 31 several patients infected with mers-cov were reported to demonstrate a severe neurological syndrome one of them met the criteria for adem 30 another report described a patient who was diagnosed with the presumably postpara-infectious syndrome of bickerstaffs brainstem encephalitis 34 recently a link between sars-cov-2 infection and adem was described in one woman 29acute monosymptomatic optic neuritis amon is sometimes an initial symptom of ms the implication of coronaviruses in the etiology of ms is described above however a study that compared the presence of coronavirus rna in the csf of individuals with amon and controls revealed no significant differences 64encephalitis is a serious and potentially fatal neurologic illness characterized by cns inflammation the etiologies of the majority of those affected are viral yet identifying the specific causal organism can be difficult morfopolu et al described an 11-month-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency who had symptoms of acute encephalitis the conventional diagnostic pcr assay was negative eventually using three independent methods the hcov-oc43 in the childs brain tissue was identified 22 clinical presentation suggestive of encephalitis was also reported in a 59-year-old woman infected with sars-cov 23 the patient developed status epilepticus which followed a few hours of disorientation during hospitalization in the intensive care unit icu due to respiratory symptoms ct scan of the brain did not detect any abnormality csf did not contain any cells but was positive for sars-cov using real-time pcr analysisone of the early symptoms of covid-19 infection is headache the first documented patient with meningoencephalitis as a result of sars-cov-2 infection had neck stiffness and transient generalized seizures 21 sars-cov-2 rna was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab but was detected in his csfparkinsons disease is a common neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the basal ganglia system disruption of motor functions is one of its main clinical manifestations csf seropositivity for several strains of coronaviruses has been reported in parkinsons disease 65 however this correlation was not confirmed or replicated over nearly three decadesacute flaccid paralysis afp is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by dramatic weakness in muscles often respiratory and bulbar muscles as a result of damage to lower motor neurons when secondary to peripheral nerve involvement the syndrome is usually a manifestation of gullianbarre syndrome the latter was reported to be related to mers-cov 34 and also to sars-cov-2 66 but is out of the scope of the current review of cns involvements in other cases of afp the paralysis is due to damage at the level of the anterior horn of the spinal cord and termed acute flaccid myelitis in such cases other etiologies especially various infections were described 67 a similar clinical picture can be secondary to acute myelopathy most commonly the result of inflammatory diseases of the spinal cord either as part of adem presentation or isolated acute transverse myelitisturgay et al described a 3-year-old girl who was admitted with lower respiratory tract infection and afp in the presence of normal nerve conduction studies and electroneuromyography ncs-emg and csf content magnetic resonance imaging mri was unavailable in the managing center co-infection with human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 was detected by real-time pcr analysis of nasal swab samples 33 interestingly the girl showed clinical improvement after treatment with ivig similarly a 66-year-old man who presented with afp and urinary and bowel incontinence which developed about 1 week after fever and subsequent respiratory symptoms was eventually diagnosed with covid-19 32 no csf ncs-emg or spinal mri were obtained due to pandemic-related reasons but the authors emphasized that the sensory clinical features implied spinal involvement following treatment that combined antibiotic agents anti-viral drugs dexamethasone and ivig the patient exhibited clinical improvement within a rather short follow-up periodloss of appetite has been reported in many patients with covid-19 and anosmia loss of the sense of smell is recognized as a common and early symptom 10 18 35 as previously mentioned sars-cov-2 has neuro-invasive propensity which has been demonstrated as a common feature of coronaviruses this supports the possibility that the virus infects the olfactory bulb in the early stages and progresses from there to various brain regions in later stagesthe exact route by which sars-cov-2 enters the cns is still poorly understood coronaviruses have been reported to first invade peripheral nerve terminals eventually reaching the cns via a trans-synaptic transfer 18 68 viral antigens have been detected in brainstem nuclei such as the nucleus of the solitary tract and nucleus ambiguus 8 10 69 this indicates possible dysfunction of the cardiorespiratory center in the brainstem as a complication of coronaviruses infection disruption of the function of cns respiratory centers in the brainstem is believed to exacerbate respiratory failure and impair the state of consciousness of individuals infected by coronavirusesane is a rare complication of viral infections like influenza which may be caused by intracranial cytokine storms that break down the blood-brain-barrier 70 evidence from the covid-19 pandemic suggests that for a subgroup of patients with severe presentation this condition might be complicated with cytokine storm syndrome 71 radiological diagnosis of ane was reported in a woman with covid-19 who presented with altered mental status 24accumulating evidence implies a possible link between infection with the novel sars-cov-2 and acute ischemic stroke ais in general infectious diseases of the respiratory system are a possible and independent risk factor for plaque rupture that results in ais 72 73 the cytokine storm caused by coronavirus infection increases the risk of thrombosis in general and of ais specifically 9 71 74 moreover changes in platelet count and d-dimer were reported in cov-sars2 infection 9 an italian study showed an increase in the ratio of arterial as well as venous thromboembolic events in patients with covid-19 75 of 388 patients in that study ais presented in nine 25 interestingly the reason for hospitalization in six of the nine patients was the neurological presentation of ais an observational study of 184 patients hospitalized in the icu with covid-19 demonstrated that five of the surviving 78 had ais 25 similarly a case series was published of five sars-cov-2 patients presenting with acute ais secondary to large vessel occlusion lvo 26 all five patients were younger than 50 years old two of them were without risk factors for stroke in another case series of covid-19 patients with ais during their hospitalization 27 all six had risk factors for stroke and were detected with lvo interestingly three of the six patients demonstrated cerebral ischemia in vascular multiple territories notably five of these patients had been positive to lupus anti-coagulant this supports previous studies that suggested that infection with sars-cov-2 triggered production of antiphospholipid antibodies 76 in a case series of four patients with covid-19 who presented with ais two of them had lvo of the middle cerebral artery 28 taken together the evidence suggests that infection with coronaviruses might increase the risk of aisadditional neurological signs reported in patients with severe sars-cov-2 with ards include myalgia 29 77 diffuse corticospinal tract signs with enhanced tendon reflexes and ankle clonus and dysexecutive syndrome 78 interestingly in the study that described the latter manifestations imaging findings included perfusion abnormalities in all the patients leptomeningial enhancement in most of them and cerebral ischemia in about 23 78 however these results should be interpreted cautiously as they may represent at least in part different effects of the critical illness state regardless of the sars-cov-2 etiologyin general the evidence available on the direct relations between respiratory neurotropic viruses and psychiatric disorders is relatively sparse specifically a positive association was described between infection with coronaviruses nl63 strain as reflected by seropositivity and mood disorders 79 an additional serological study demonstrated a rise in the level of antibodies against the same strain of coronaviruses in individuals with recent onset of psychosis 80early reports from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic suggest psychiatric morbidities that have some resemblance to those reported in the early phase of the sars outbreak patients are reported to experience fear loneliness anger and general distress which have been primarily attributed to the need for quarantine and infection symptoms such as fever and cough 81 moreover adverse effects of treatments such as insomnia from corticosteroids and psychotic disorder from chloroquine might exacerbate patients mental status 82 83 additional reasons for psychiatric morbidities include experiencing adverse effects of treatment during hospitalization uncertainty regarding prognosis and undergoing icu care therefore infection with of sars-cov-2 is considered a traumatic experience this enhances anxiety and substantial mental distressin the immediate aftermath of the sars epidemic various psychiatric morbidities were reported these included depression adjustment reactions anxiety agitation psychotic symptoms delirium and even higher suicidality 82 84 85 in the early recovery phase up to 35 of sars survivors showed signs of anxiety depression or both 84 86 importantly post-traumatic stress reactions were identified in sars survivors in the early 24 week period following discharge furthermore about 45 of the respondents in that outbreak were diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder during the study period psychiatric disorders such as major depression post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd and adjustment disorder were described during the 6 months after patients discharge 84 85 cumulative incidence of any psychiatric disorder during the 3 years following the sars outbreak was reported to reach 59 in sars survivors 86 for example the cumulative incidence rates for ptsd and depressive disorders were about 48 and 44 respectively 86 similarly the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity at 30 months after sars infection was reported to reach up to one-third of the total survivors who presented with signs of various psychiatric diagnoses at that timepoint about 26 and 16 had ptsd and depressive disorders respectively 86the above highlights the urgency of addressing mental health care needs related to the current pandemic of covid-19 particularly for those with comorbid mental disorders lessons learned during the sars outbreak should be applied to designing strategies in the novel covid-19 outbreak 87accumulating evidence from the current sars-cov-2 pandemic together with literature on other coronaviruses suggest that infection with coronaviruses may be related to cns manifestations or complications including anosmia acute ischemic strokes viral meningoenchephalitis acute necrotizing encephalopathy acute flaccid paralysis and other presumably postpara-infectious syndromes in addition patients with covid-19 may be particularly prone to mental disorders including ptsd major depression and adjustment disorder therefore we believe these patients should be carefully monitored for clinical signs suspecting cns involvement such as headache seizures sensory or motor deficits and altered mental state early diagnosis of cns manifestations in individuals with covid-19 may be crucial for their overall prognosis a multidisciplinary approach should be emphasized by health authorities which would provide urgent mental health support for the affected and also

coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 infection began in december 2019 in wuhan the capital of central chinas hubei province 1 2 while the virus likely has a zoonotic origin related to the citys huanan seafood market widespread human-to-human transmission has resulted in 73451 cases in 26 countries with 1875 deaths as of february 18 2020 3 - 7 disease was first reported in the united states on january 20 2020 and the total number of cases in the united states has reached 15 as of february 17 2020 7 8 the most common presenting clinical symptoms are fever and cough in addition to other non-specific symptomatology including dyspnea headache muscle soreness and fatigue 9 about 20 of cases are severe and mortality is approximately 3 10 the world health organization who declared a global health emergency on january 30 2020 11this is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans 1 two other notable examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers the former of which began in southern china and resulted in 774 deaths out of 8098 infected individuals in 29 countries from november 2002 through july 2003 and the latter of which originated in saudi arabia and was responsible for 848 deaths among 2458 individuals in 27 countries through july 2019 12 13as clinical physicians epidemiologists virologists phylogeneticists and others work with public health officials and policymakers to understand infection pathogenesis and control disease spread some early investigators have observed imaging patterns on chest radiography and computed tomography ct 14 - 25 for instance an initial prospective analysis in wuhan revealed bilateral lung opacities on 40 of 41 98 chest cts in infected patients and described lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation as the most typical findings 4 other investigators examined chest cts in 21 infected patients and found high rates of ground-glass opacities and consolidation sometimes with a rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution 26 another group evaluated lung abnormalities related to disease time course and found that chest ct showed the most extensive disease approximately ten days after symptom onset 16 thoracic radiology evaluation is often key to the evaluation of patients suspected of covid-19 infection prompt recognition of disease is invaluable to ensure timely treatment and from a public health perspective rapid patient isolation is crucial for containment of this communicable diseasein this study we characterize chest ct findings in 121 patients infected with covid-19 in china in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial ct scan this study builds on initial work by early investigators during the first few weeks of the outbreak by evaluating a larger number of patients as well as by examining imaging features as the disease moves into the more subacute phase andor earlier detection with increased vigilance for detection we hypothesized that certain ct findings may be more common depending on the time course of infectionour institutional review board irb waived written informed consent for this retrospective study that evaluated de-identified data and involved no potential risk to patients to avert any potential breach of confidentiality no link between the patients and the researchers was made availablefrom january 18 2020 until february 2 2020 121 adult patients admitted to four hospitals in four provinces in china with confirmed covid-19 and who underwent chest ct were enrolled in our study twenty-one of these patients were previously evaluated on our prior study focusing on the ct imaging manifestations of covid-19 but were reevaluated for the purposes of this new study 26 patient selection was consecutive in each of the four institutions and the solitary exclusion criteria was patient age  18 years table 1 in addition to age and gender clinical information collected included travel and exposure history when known all patients were positive for covid-19 via laboratory testing with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr of respiratory secretions obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage endotracheal aspirate nasopharyngeal swab or oropharyngeal swab in addition the number of rrt-pcr tests performed on each patient was tabulated when known on which test a positive result was found was tabulated and the number of days between symptomology onset and date of first positive test was tracked the rrt-pcr test kits used on the patients in this study were manufactured by sansure biotech inc changsha china shanghai zhijiang biotechnology co shanghai china or da an gene co guangzhuo chinatwenty-two patients were from

amsterdam netherlands all scans were performed without intravenous contrast with the patient in the supine position during end-inspiration only the initial chest cts were evaluated if a patient had a follow-up ct during the study time window it was not analyzed for this studyall ct images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained cardiothoracic radiologists with approximately five years of experience each ab mc using a viewing console imaging was reviewed independently and final decisions reached by consensus are reported no negative control cases were examinedfor each patient the chest ct scan was evaluated for the following characteristics 1 presence of ground-glass opacities 2 presence of consolidation 3 laterality of ground-glass opacities and consolidation 4 number of lobes affected where either ground-glass or consolidative opacities were present 5 degree of involvement of each lung lobe in addition to overall extent of lung involvement measured by means of a total severity score as detailed below 6 presence of nodules 7 presence of a pleural effusion 8 presence of thoracic lymphadenopathy defined as lymph node size of 10 mm in short-axis dimension 9 airways abnormalities including airway wall thickening bronchiectasis and endoluminal secretions 10 axial distribution of disease categorized as no axial distribution of disease central peribronchovascular predominant disease or peripheral predominant disease and 11 presence of underlying lung disease such as emphysema or fibrosis other abnormalities including linear opacities opacities with a rounded morphology opacities with a reverse halo sign opacities with a crazy-paving pattern and opacities with intralesional cavitation were noted ground-glass opacification was defined as hazy increased lung attenuation with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins whereas consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of margins of vessels and airway walls 27 each of the five lung lobes was assessed for degree of involvement and classified as none 0 minimal 1 - 25 mild 26 - 50 moderate 51 - 75 or severe 76 - 100 no involvement corresponded to a lobe score of 0 minimal to a lobe score of 1 mild to a lobe score of 2 moderate to a lobe score of 3 and severe to a lobe score of 4 an overall lung total severity score was reached by summing the five lobe scores range of possible scores 0 - 20the amount of time between the initial appearance of patient symptoms such as fever cough etc and the date of both the first positive rrt-pcr test as well as the date of the initial chest ct examination was noted for each patient twenty seven patients were excluded because the date of first symptom appearance was unknown leaving 94 patients for analysis if the time interval between first clinical symptom and ct was two days or less 36 of 94 patients the patient was considered to have been imaged in the early phase of illness if the time interval was between three and five days 33 of 94 patients the patient was considered to have been imaged in the intermediate phase of illness if the time interval was between six and 12 days 25 of 94 patients the patient was considered to have been imaged in the late phase of illnessthere were 61 men and 60 women studied with mean age 453 years age range 18 - 80 years with standard deviation 16 yearsof the 121 patients 27 22 had no ground-glass opacities and no consolidation on chest ct table 2 of the 94 patients with ground-glass opacities consolidation or both 41 34 had only ground-glass opacities with no consolidation and two

bilateral lung disease figure 1 twenty 17 patients had exclusively unilateral lung involvement including 13 patients that had only right lung involvement figure 2 and 7 patients that had only left lung involvement the mean total lung severity score for the 121 patients was 3 range 0 - 18 with standard deviation 3 thoracic lymphadenopathy lung cavitation and pulmonary nodules were notably absent in all 121 patients and only 1 patient 1 had a pleural effusion a trace left effusion table 3the time between initial onset of symptoms and subsequent chest ct was known for 94 patients and assigned as early 0-2 days intermediate 3-5 days or late 6-12 days the frequency of ground-glass opacities and consolidation was far fewer in the early group as compared with the intermediate and late groups table 4 figures 3 and 4 twenty of 36 early patients 56 95ci 47-65 had no lung opacities as compared with three of 33 intermediate patients 9 and 1 of 25 4 late patients bilateral lung involvement was

rrt-pcr result was 45 days for all 102 patients range 0  18 days 23 days for the early group range 0  7 days 47 days for the intermediate group range 0  18 days and 72 days for the late group range 1  12 daysan average of 3605 new cases of covid-19 have been reported per day since our preliminary research was published on february 4 2020 7 just as clinicians are evaluating more suspected patients radiologists are similarly interpreting more chest cts in those suspected of infection chest ct is a vital component in the diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected covid-19 infection indeed given the limited number of rrt-pcr kits in some centers and the possibility of false negative rrt-pcr results the national health commission of the peoples republic of china has encouraged diagnosis based on clinical and chest ct findings alone 28 in this study of 121 patients with confirmed covid-19 infection it is noteworthy that 2036 56 of patients imaged 0-2 days early after symptom onset had a normal ct with complete absence of ground-glass opacities and consolidation as opposed to 333 9 of intermediate patients and 125 4 of late patients only one of these patients who was in the early group had an initially negative rrt-pcr result suggesting that rrt-pcr is positive even in patients with normal chest ct chest ct therefore has limited sensitivity and negative predictive value early after symptom onset and is thereby unlikely a reliable standalone tool to rule out covid-19 infectionother findings of this work largely concur with early radiology investigative efforts 16 insofar as this pattern of ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities often with a bilateral and peripheral lung distribution is emerging as the chest ct hallmark of covid-19 infection this pattern of disease somewhat similar to that described in earlier coronavirus outbreaks such as sars and mers also dovetails with the blueprint thoracic radiologists recognize as the archetypal response to acute lung injury whereby an initial often infectious or inflammatory acute insult causes ground-glass opacities that may coalesce into dense consolidative lesions and then progressively evolve and organize in often a more linear fashion with predilection for the lung periphery and somewhat with a crazy paving pattern or emergence of a reverse halo sign the findings in this study which highlight the increased frequency of such findings as consolidation bilateral disease greater total lung involvement linear opacities a crazy-paving pattern appearance of the reverse halo sign and peripheral lung distribution in patients imaged with ct a longer time after symptomatology starts represent the ct correlate for the underlying pathophysiology of the disease process as it organizes moreover the notable absence of ancillary chest ct findings such as lymphadenopathy pleural effusions pulmonary nodules and lung cavitation likewise are consistent with early case descriptionsthere are several limitations to our study firstly some patients were unable to be included in the evaluation of infection time course because of incomplete clinical histories where the precise time of symptom onset was unknown furthermore some patients may have received medical intervention once suspected or confirmed to have infection perhaps antimicrobial therapy fluid administration or steroid therapy may affect chest ct findings which was not accounted for in this work in addition there may have been a selection bias in these institutions in terms of which patients were imaged with ct for instance if more clinically ill patients were more likely to be imaged sooner or imaged at all then this may have an impact on results although the opposite effect was observed in this study whereby those with the most severe lung involvement had a longer time between symptom onset and ct scanour investigative efforts have demonstrated that frequency of ct findings is related to infection time course our data largely concur with work by pan et al that demonstrated preponderance of ground-glass abnormality in early disease followed by development of crazy paving and finally increasing consolidation later in the disease course 16 meanwhile the outbreak is at a stage of evolving from the acute to a more subacute phase in many patients recognizing imaging patterns based on infection time course is paramount for not only understanding the pathophysiology and natural history of infection but also for helping to predict patient progression and potential complication development eventually as infection duration in a large number of patients extends from the acute and subacute phases to either a completely healed outcome or to a chronic phase in patients over the coming several weeks and months future investigators may evaluate imaging findings in chronic patients such work could evaluate if long-term complications absent in this study such as pleural effusions empyema lymphadenopathy and lung cavitation potentially arisein december 2019 there was an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp in wuhan the pathogen was 2019 novel coronavirus 2019ncov which had not previously been detected in the human body the world health organization who officially named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 meanwhile the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 due to the measures of preventive control and medical treatment the rising momentum of the epidemic in china has been contained and the epidemic has been alleviated however morbidity abroad is on the rise and the virus is spreading globally according to data from the currently released report the pathogen may infect people of all ages but the severe disease rate is higher among the elderly population which accounts for the vast majority of mortalities

 to curb the outbreak of novel coronavirus and reduce the harm to the elderly we have compiled the key points for the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia in the elderly trial implementation in accordance with the recent literatureon january 24 2020 the chinese center for disease control and prevention national institute for viral disease control and prevention published the virus seed information of the first novel coronavirus in china which shows that like the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov the novel coronavirus belongs to the betacoronavirus genus gene sequence alignment shows that the novel coronavirus is most similar to the bat sarslike coronavirus batslcovzc45 with a homology of 88 the equivalent rates for sarscov and merscov are 79 and 50 respectively

an essential receptor for sarscov is angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 and this mainly results in the infection of cilia bronchial epithelial cells and type ii alveolar epithelial cells studies

5
 show that novel coronavirus is highly homologous to sarscov which can be attributed to the combination of virus spike protein and human ace2 receptor protein militated to the host this receptor is mainly distributed in the pulmonary vascular endothelial cells heart kidney and so forth the physicochemical property data of the novel coronavirus mainly come from the study of sarscov the virus is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat exposure to 56c for 30 minutes and lipid solvents such as ether 75 ethanol chlorinecontaining disinfectant peracetic acid and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus chlorhexidine has not been effective in inactivating the virusa total of 82 218 cases of ncp had been diagnosed in china up to march 28 2020 epidemiological studies

 show that at the early stage the virus was transmitted to humans from wildlife then from human to human which caused an outbreak of infected people currently patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection asymptomatic infected people can also be an infectious source transmission of the virus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact there is the possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment with a long exposure to high concentrations of aerosol
9
 the who estimated that the basic reproduction number r0 of novel coronavirus is 1425
10
 based on early research from 425 patients the estimated r0 is 22
6
 a later study from 4021 patients showed that the estimated r0 was 377 range 223482 which shows that the transmissibility of novel coronavirus is equivalent to that of sarscov and higher than that of merscov
3
 some studies also show that the transmissibility of novel coronavirus is higher than that of sarscov
11
 up to march 28 2020 the cases of death from ncp had reached 3301 with a case fatality rate of 40 according to the available data the mortality rate of ncp is lower than that of sarscov 96 and merscov 34
12

people are commonly susceptible to 2019ncov especially the elderly with comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease

 the elderly are more likely to have severe cases and to require intensive care unit icu care

 and this population has a high mortality rate a study
13
 of 1099 patients diagnosed with 2019ncov showed that the median age of patients was 470 years with 151 of all patients and 27 of severely ill patients aged over 65 years and a median incubation period of 30 days range 0 to 24 days an analysis from the research of 4021 diagnosed patients showed that nearly half 47 of the patients were aged over 50 years and 1052 patients 262 were aged over 60 years the mortality of patients some with complications aged over 60 years 53 was significantly higher than that of those aged under 60 years 53

 the chinese center for disease control and prevention has analyzed all cases of patients with coronavirus pneumonia in the chinese reporting system for infectious diseases up to february 11 2020 there were 44 672 confirmed cases in which the proportions of patients aged over 60 were 441 in wuhan 351 in hubei province including wuhan and 312 in china including hubei
14

a major reason for the widespread transmission of the novel coronavirus in the population is the lack of immunocompetence and there is no specific medicine for this virus in healthy young people with normal immunity the virus can be effectively eliminated by rapidly mobilizing the bodys immune functionthere are many agerelated variations in the respiratory and immune systems
15
 
16
 as for the elderly there are many variations in the respiratory systems physiological function caused by the change of pulmonary anatomical structure and muscle atrophy such as the weakening of airway clearance the reduction of lung reserve and the depression of defensive barrier function in addition proinflammatory cytokines baselines in the tissue and circulation of the elderly rise with age especially interleukin il1 il6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf resulting in a condition known as inflammatory senescence corresponding to inflammatory senescence the bodys immune response to pathogenic threaten or tissue damage is blunt called immunosenescence with age the function of innate immunity and adaptive immunity declines the discernment chemotaxis and phagocytosis of macrophages natural killer cells and neutrophils downgrade and the diversity of the tcell receptor tcr decreases furthermore at the age of 60 years the thymus that produces immature tcells is replaced by adipose tissue which leads to the accumulation of memory tcells and effector tcells and results in the decrease of immature tcells meanwhile the bcells ability to produce antibodies declines with age which may cause hypoimmunityinflammatory senescence and immunosenescence make individuals susceptible to novel coronavirus the elderly in morbid states such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or extrapulmonary organ system diseases are more likely to have severe respiratory infections which causes the high mortality in elderly patients with ncp the specific mechanism by which inflammatory factor storms are more likely to develop into acute respiratory failure in the elderly infected with novel coronavirus is unknown it is still to be studied whether this mechanism is associated with the inflammatory imbalance that leads to disruption of pulmonary immune homeostasis andor the decline of innate immunity and adaptive immunity that aggravate novel coronavirus transmission which leads to the imbalance response of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines
17

the novel coronavirus mainly leads to pulmonary infection which increases the hearts workload causes hyperglycemia and makes it harder to control the infection the characteristics of multisystem disease in the elderly make it a complex condition with all the diseases interplaying with each other which increases the difficulty of treatmentbased on a current epidemiological survey the incubation of ncp is 114 days and mostly 37 days the most common symptoms are fever dry cough and weakness nasal congestion runny nose sore throat emesis and diarrhea are found in some cases severe patients develop dyspnea andor hypoxemia after 1 week and may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock refractory metabolic acidosis coagulopathy multiple organ failure and so forth there are no clinical data on novel coronavirus infection in the elderly however the clinical symptoms of pneumonia in elderly patients are often atypical so if elderly patients have dyspnea ards or unexplained systemic symptoms such as fatigue shock coagulation disorders or other symptoms the possibility of new coronavirus infection should be consideredwith the popularization of etiological examination many suspected patients with mild cases have been diagnosed however there are neither clinical studies about the clinical characteristics of these mild patients nor clinical studies about the proportion and characteristics of the elderly nevertheless they are still significant in the prevention and control of disease transmission and patients with atypical manifestations cannot be ignoredin the early stages of the disease peripheral white blood cell count is normal or decreased and the lymphocyte count is decreased some patients have elevated liver enzymes muscle enzymes and myoglobin most patients have elevated creactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and normal procalcitonin the levels of some inflammatory cytokines such as il2 tnf il6 and interferon are normal or higher in severe cases ddimer increases and peripheral blood lymphocytes progressively decreasein the early stage chest imaging shows multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes which are more apparent in the peripheral zone of the lungs as the disease progresses imaging shows multiple groundglass opacities and infiltration in both lungs in severe cases pulmonary consolidation may occur however pleural effusion is rare the elderly often suffer from chronic diseases that may effect and disturb the auxiliary examinations which should be considered minutely in the process of treatment for example the elderly may have an increase in blood parameters and procalcitonin earlier than other patients which is caused by cobacterial infection they may experience patient delay caused by atypical symptoms which makes the initial manifestation of laboratory examination atypical and underlying pulmonary diseases may lead to the early manifestation of atypical pulmonary imaging and under these circumstances the dynamic observation of past imaging data and imaging features is more meaningfulwe recommend the adoption of the criteria in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7

ncp should be distinguished from influenza virus parainfluenza virus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus and any other known respiratory virus that can cause upper respiratory infection and pneumonia it should be distinguished from bacterial pneumonia mycoplasma and chlamydia pneumonia and it should be distinguished from nodular vasculitis multiple myositis and organized pneumoniafor elderly patients clinical typing must be accompanied by prospective judgment such as the consideration of functional status of other systems as lung lesions of elderly patients may be more likely to induce failure in other systems which may even occur before respiratory failure it is advisable to conduct a comprehensive assessment of elderly patients by doing so elderly highrisk patients who may tend to get severecritical illness will be identified and provided intervention as soon as possible which can improve the prognosisonce medical personnel at all levels and all types of institutions find suspected cases that meet the definition they should immediately carry out singleperson isolation treatment after consultation of inhospital experts or attending physicians those who are still considered as suspected cases should be reported through direct network within 2 hours and led to the collection of specimens for virus nucleic acid testing meanwhile transporting patients to designated hospital as soon as possible with safety ensured even patients with common respiratory pathogens who have had close contact with positive novel coronavirus patients are advised to take a timely novel coronavirus nucleic acid test suspected cases can be excluded if the respiratory pathogens in nucleic acid testing are negative sampling interval must be at least 24 hours and the igm and igg of the novel coronavirusspecific antibodies are still negative 7 days after onsetsuspected and confirmed cases should be treated in a designated hospital with effective isolation and protection suspected cases should receive isolated treatment in one single room separately while confirmed cases can be accommodated in the same room critical cases should be treated in the icu as early as possible
general treatment allow patients to rest in bed and provide strengthening support therapy ensure sufficient caloric intake for patients monitor patients water electrolyte and acidbase balances to maintain internal environment stability and closely monitor vital signs and oxygen saturationsputum drainage the sputumdrainage ability of elderly patients can decrease and sometimes they need mechanical assistance assisted sputum drainage procedures should be strictly followedoxygen therapy patients with hypoxemia should be provided with oxygen therapy immediately with blood oxygen saturation maintaining at 90 note 1 oxygen therapy methods patients with mild symptoms should receive normal nasal catheter and mask oxygen supply patients with severe symptoms suffering from increased respiratory distress or where standard oxygen therapy has had no effects can be given highflow nasal cannula hfnc oxygen therapy starting at 20 lmin and gradually increased to 5060 lmin in the meantime adjust oxygen concentration fraction of inspired oxygen according to the oxygenation targets for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the decision of whether they need to use hfnc oxygen therapy should be made after assessing the possible risk of carbon dioxide retention if possible inhalation of mixed hydrogen and oxygen can be applied 2 respiratory support methods the noninvasive ventilator which is not recommended prior to hfnc oxygen therapy should be adopted immediately once the hfnc oxygen therapy fails to reach the treatment objectives as desired the noninvasive ventilator is the preferred mechanical ventilation mode if the medical staff can achieve complete protection if noninvasive mechanical ventilation works for 2 hours showing no improvements on patients or patients cannot tolerate noninvasive ventilation with increased airway secretion severe cough or unstable hemodynamic close observation should be arranged and if necessary invasive ventilation can be used for invasive mechanical ventilation use the ventilation strategy for lung protection low tidal volume 48 mlkg predicted bodyweight and low inspiratory pressure platform pressure  30 cm h2o 1 cm h2o  0098 kpa to reduce ventilatorrelated lung injury closed sputum suction is selected according to the condition of airway secretion if necessary bronchoscopy should be used with appropriate treatment when it comes to the most serious time proneposition ventilation lung recruitment or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used however as regards treating critically ill patients the main recommendation of mechanical ventilation among the elderly is the noninvasive ventilator noninvasive mechanical ventilation should be used carefully after full evaluation of benefitsantiviral therapy it is advised to try interferon aerosolized inhalation 5 million units each time 2 ml 2 timesd with sterilized injection water lopinavirritonavir two capsules 2 timesd no more than 10 days per session umifenovir 200 mg 3 times per day no more than 10 days of treatment or ribavirin intravenous injection 500 mg 23 timesd no more than 10 days per session additionally hospitals can try interferon 5 million u or equivalent dose each time adding 2 ml of sterilized water atomization inhalation twice daily lopinavirritonavir 200 mg50 mg per pill two pills each time twice daily no longer than 10 days ribavirin suggested to be used jointly with interferon or lopinavirritonavir 500 mg each time for adults twice or three times of intravenous injection daily no longer than 10 days chloroquine phosphate for the elderly aged  65 years 500 mg bid for 7 days with bodyweight over 50 kg 500 mg bid for days 12 and 500 mg qd for days 37 with bodyweight below 50 kg note chloroquine cannot be used for patients with heart diseases and umifenovir 200 mg tid no longer than 10 days the clinical effect of the above drugs in the treatment of ncp still lacks largescale clinical research and evidencebased medical evidence in clinical application the efficacy of all currently tested drugs needs to be further evaluated since the elderly have poor tolerance to medicine with different diseases they often take several kinds of medicine which may result in adverse reactions such as liver and kidney damage antiviral drugs should be used cautiously during the treatment process adverse reactions should be monitored if there are intolerable adverse reactions the drug should be stopped in time and symptomatic treatment should be givenglucocorticoid severe patients can take glucocorticoids at a dose of 12 mgkgd and the recommended course of treatment is 35 daysantibiotics blind or improper use of antimicrobial medicine especially combined use of broadspectrum antibacterial medicine should be avoided strengthen bacteriological monitoring and apply antimicrobial medicine immediately when there is evidence of secondary bacterial infectioncirculation support improve microcirculation and use vasoactive medicine on the basis of adequate fluid resuscitation if necessary take the hemodynamic monitoring for ards patients with conservative volume control when hypoperfusion is ensuredintestinal microecological regulator can be used to maintain intestinal microecological balanceas elderly patients are prone to multiple system organ dysfunction and even failure other systemic complications should be prevented including disseminated intravascular coagulation and deep vein thrombosis delirium and double infection occurring in gastrointestinal

suspected cases can choose homebased care as appropriate after the infection of novel coronavirus has resolved patients who have been diagnosed with novel coronavirus and are recovered fully are advised to continue 14day isolated homebased care and health monitoring as the elderly often suffer from several diseases with reduced ability of daily life attention should also be paid to whether the followup medical system is complete after homebased care which should ensure patients medical security and provide medical services if there are any changes in patients conditionsin homebased care the elderly should be very careful of nutritional balance malnutrition is one of the most important negative factors affecting the prognosis of disease among elderly patients the elderly are recommended to have a balanced diet and balanced intake of calories protein vitamins minerals and so on with meat and vegetables to ensure adequate nutrition elderly people should eat foods that are easily digested eat more vegetables and fruits drink water frequently and avoid eating wild animals and rotten or expired food chilled poultry should be purchased through regular channels and meat eggs and milk should be fully cooked before eating elderly people with poor appetite and eating inadequate food can take some protein and trace elements appropriately through nutritionally fortified foods special medical formula foods or nutrient supplements for all elderly people attention should also be paid to avoid aspiration pneumonia due to improper inhaling patients and their families nursing at home should receive standardized health education and training including room arrangements hand hygiene proper use of masks respiratory hygiene disinfection standard of household articles contact information of medical institutions nutrition and health knowledge psychological selfregulation skills and diseasemonitoring methods after confirmation of homebased care with patients the medical staff should assess the patients general condition and reconfirm the patients medical treatment in the past and homebased medical treatment plan and make sure patients and their families understand those recovered patients with isolated homebased care are also suggested to have followup to the hospital at 2 and 4 weeks postrecoveryat the same time medical personnel should also inform the patients of which indications require contact immediately for consultation and hospital treatment if one of the following situations occurs homebased care should be considered for reevaluation or even suspension increased dyspnea fever patients unable to bring their temperature below 37c after using antipyretic analgesics according to the instructions or still relying on the antipyretic and analgesic medicine to control fever after 3 days c patients suffer from purulent sputum hemoptysis or other systemic manifestations such as chest pain nausea vomiting diarrhea decreased urine volume mental disorders unexplained decrease in blood pressure systolic blood pressure more than 20 mm hg lower than daily values or family members or nursing staff in close contact are newly diagnosed with novel coronavirus infection or other suspected infections
severe patients requiring tracheal intubation should be immediately transferred to the icu with negative pressure conditions for treatment once diagnosed as requiring tracheal intubation the operation should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of comprehensive protectionduring transit an oxygen storage mask should be used to provide oxygen of 15 lmin in order to ensure oxygen storage airbag inflation is satisfiedtracheal intubation should be induced with a standard and rapid sequence with muscle relaxants used as far as possible to avoid the spread of droplets caused by coughingafter intubation the eye mask and other reusable items should be sterilized with jianzhisu compound alcohol disinfectant before removal from the negative pressure wardthe closed sputum suction should be used for patients with intubation in order to avoid air transmission caused by the ventilators airflowin special cases when the ventilator must be cut off for airway operation the standby function of the ventilator should be used to avoid airborne transmission caused by the ventilators airflow if the ventilator has no standby function the ytype nozzle should be blocked to avoid airborne transmission
patients with a temperature returning to normal for more than 3 days significantly improved respiratory symptoms significantly absorbed pulmonary imaging inflammation and respiratory pathogens nucleic acid testing showing negative for two consecutive times sampling interval must be at least 24 hours can be released from isolation or transferred to the appropriate department for treatment of other diseasesnothing to disclosean ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was reported in wuhan hubei province china 1-3 in december 2019 in the following weeks infections spread across china and other countries around the world 4-6 the chinese public health clinical and scientific communities took prompt response to allow for timely recognition of the new virus and shared the viral gene sequence to the world 27 on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern pheic 8 on february 12 2020 who named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 9 a group of international experts with a range of specializations has worked with chinese counterparts to try to contain the outbreak 10at present real-time reverse-transcriptionpolymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr assay for covid-19 has been developed and used in clinics although rt-pcr remains the reference standard to make a definitive diagnose of covid-19 infection 11 the high false negative rate 12 and unavailability of rt-pcr assay in the early stage of the outbreak restricted prompt diagnosis of infected patients radiological examinations especially thin slice chest ct play an important role in fighting this infectious disease 13 chest ct can identify the early phase lung infection 14-15 and prompt larger public health surveillance and response systems 16 currently chest ct findings have been recommended as major evidence for confirmed clinical diagnosis in hubei china the addition of chest ct for diagnosis resulted in 14840 confirmed new cases 13332 clinically diagnosed cases reported on february 13 2020 comprehensive and timely review of radiological role in fighting civid-19 remains urgent and mandatoryin preliminary report complete viral genome analysis reveals that the virus shares 88 sequence identity to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-like coronaviruses but more distant from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 17 hence it was temporarily called 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov coronavirus is an enveloped and single-stranded ribonucleic acid named for its solar corona like appearance due to 9-12 nm-long surface spikes 18 there are four major structural proteins encoded by the coronaviral genome on the envelope one of which is the spike s protein that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and mediates subsequent fusion between the envelope and host cell membranes to aid viral entry into the host cell 1920 on february 11 2020 the coronavirus study group csg of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses finally designated it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 based on phylogeny taxonomy and established practice 21 soon later who named the disease caused by this coronavirus as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 9 on the basis of current data it seems that covid-19 might be initially hosted by bats and might have been transmitted to humans via pangolin 22 or other wild animals 1723 sold at the huanan seafood market but subsequent spread via human-to-human transmissionon december 2019 the earliest symptom onset of confirmed patients appeared 24 at first the morbidity remained low but reached a tipping point in the middle of january 2020 during the second half of this month a remarkable increase of infected patients in affected cities occurred outside hubei province because of the population movement before lunar chinese new year 25 followed by an exponential growth until january 23 2020 the outbreak spread to the other countries attracting extensive attention around the world figure 1 evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission 12 by droplets contact and fomite 26-27 so far there is no definite evidence for intrauterine infection 28 current estimates are that covid-19 has a median incubation period of 3 days range 0 to 24 days with potential asymptomatic transmission 26 29 at the end of january 2020 who confirmed more than ten thousand cases infected with covid-19 across china 30 on february 13 2020 13332 new clinically diagnosed cases were firstly reported from hubei official reports included clinically diagnosed cases and laboratory-confirmed cases because chest ct findings are recommended as the major evidence for clinically confirmed cases by diagnosis and treatment program of 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia trial fifth version by national health and health commission of china in 2020 13 as of february 19 2020 this rose to a total of 74280 confirmed cases in china and 924 confirmed cases in 24 countries outside china and a total of 2009 deaths globally 10 figure 2 to control covid-19 effective prevention and control measurements must include early detection diagnosis treatment and quarantine to block human-to-human transmission as well as reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers 10understanding the clinical symptoms of covid-19 is important although the clinical symptoms are indicated nonspecific common symptoms include fever cough and myalgia or fatigue patients may initially present with diarrhea and nausea a few days prior to fever suggesting fever is dominant but not the premier symptom of infection a small number of patients can have headache or hemoptysis 2632 and even relatively asymptomatic 12 affected older men with comorbidities are more likely to have respiratory failure due to severe alveolar damage 31 disease onset may show rapid progression to organ dysfunction eg shock acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury and even death in severe cases 132 meanwhile patients might show normal or lower white blood cell counts lymphopenia or thrombocytopenia with extended activated thromboplastin time and increased c-reactive protein level 12631-32 in short a patient having fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms with lymphopenia or leukopenia should be suspected especially for patients with wuhan exposure or close contact historythe first task for the clinical diagnostic workflow is to confirm wuhan exposure history or close contact with people from wuhan or confirmed patients during the past two weeks however the number of the patients with unknown exposure history is increasing due to the rapid and wide spread of the disease the national health commission of china 3334 formulated the diagnosis and treatment program of 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia trial sixth version table 1 based on the recommendations of the world health organization who on severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 35-37 a patient with one exposure history and two clinical conditions is considered as suspected case if there is no clear exposure history suspected patients should meet 3 clinical conditions table 1 based on the fifth trial edition 13 chest ct findings of viral pneumonia are regarded as evidence of clinical diagnosis of covid-19 infection however the who did not accept ct without rt-pcr confirmation until february 17 2020 38 and the most recently published diagnosis and treatment program of 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia trial sixth version has deleted the term of clinical diagnosis 34 the final etiology diagnosis of covid-19 is necessary which can be further confirmed by positive real-time rt-pcr assay for covid-19 using respiratory or blood samples or by viral gene sequencing of respiratory or blood samples that are highly homologous with covid-19 according to the clinical manifestations confirmed patients are divided into mild moderate severe and critical types table 2 1334 39to date only five case series studies 1640-43 and some case reports 44-54 have investigated the chest ct imaging features of covid-19 pneumonia covid-19 pneumonia has nonspecific and various chest ct imaging features the typical chest ct findings include multifocal bilateral ggos with patchy consolidations prominent peripherally subpleural distribution and preferred posterior part or lower lobe predilection figures 4-9 1455-56 ggo is a hazy increase in attenuation that appears in a variety of interstitial and alveolar processes with preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins 57 while consolidation is an area of opacification obscuring the margins of vessels and airway walls 58 in patients with covid-19 pneumonia focal or multifocal pure ggo figures 4a 5 6b and ggo with reticular andor interlobular septal thickening as typical crazy-paving pattern figure 6a were often observed while pure consolidation figure 7 was relatively less common or absent 1640-42 pure ggo lesions figure 4a 5 9b can be the early appearance of covid-19 pneumonia chung et al 41 found one patient with an initial normal chest ct that evolved into a new solitary rounded peripheral ggo after three days the reversed ct halo sign defined as a rounded area of ground glass surrounded by a complete or almost complete ring of consolidation can also be observed 1649 pleural effusion lung cavitation lymphadenopathy and calcification are rarely reported 40-4449-50 table 3 summarizes the characteristic chest ct imaging features of covid-19 pneumoniaother diseases mimic covid-19 pneumonia and should be differentiated including community-acquired pneumonia such as streptococcus pneumonia mycoplasma and chlamydia related pneumonia and other coronavirus infections differential diagnosis is very important to early quarantine suspected patients with fever and reduce cross infection table 4 shows typical clinical and imaging findings of covid-19 mimics such as common cold influenza and other coronaviruses diseases including sars and mers 1159-63 wuhan exposure history or close contact with confirmed or suspected patients is an essential clue for the diagnosis however for patients with unknown epidemiological history typical clinical and imaging appearance can indicate suspected covid-19 rt-pcr test should be performed in these patients in summary the diagnosis of covid-19 should combine epidemiological history clinical and imaging manifestations and rt-pcr test the reference standardalthough chest ct findings are nonspecific for covid-19 detection ct findings have been recommended as major evidence of clinical diagnosis in hubei province by the national health and health commission of china 13 rt-pcr positive for covid-19 remains the reference standard 11 but rt-pcr results can be affected by sampling errors and low virus load 64-66 previous sars studies 67-69 showed that rt-pcr lacked sensitivity during the first five days of the disease current reports show that chest ct may demonstrate pneumonia but multiple rt-pcr tests of nasopharyngeal or throat swabs test negative 125370-71 and fang et al 72 compared the detection rate of initial chest ct and rt-pcr and reported a higher detection rate for initial ct 505198 than first rt-pcr 365171 patients p0001 xie et al found that of 167 patients evaluated 3 5167 patients had initially negative rt-pcr but positive chest ct and both rt-pcr and ct were concordant for covid19 in 928 n155167 patients 70 furthermore rt-pcr results must be checked by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in the early stage of an outbreak taking a longer time to confirm the final diagnosis 25 thin slice chest ct is easy to perform fast and detects early covid-19 pneumonia with high sensitivity providing valuable information for further diagnosis while aiding prevention and control of covid-19ct can also assess the disease severity of covid-19 to guide clinical management clinical observations showed 1 that intensive care unit icu patients on admission often presented with bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental consolidation while non-icu patients presented with bilateral ggos and subsegmental consolidation in severe patients ct can demonstrate diffuse heterogeneous consolidation with ggos in bilateral lungs with air bronchial sign and bronchiectasis figure 9 presenting as white lung when most lung lobes are affected 15 patients also may present with thickening of interlobar septa and bilateral pleura with a small pleural effusion 1156additionally ct surveils disease time course of covid-19 chung et al 41 found that 7 of 8 patients showed marked progression presenting as increasing number extent and density of ggos figures 4 9 pan et al 40 reviewed 21 confirmed and recovered patients who underwent repeated ct at approximately 4-day intervals and summarized four stages of the disease early progressive peak and absorption they found that ggos will rapidly grow demonstrating consolidation and crazy-paving pattern as the disease progresses the lesions will absorb without crazy-paving pattern on absorption stage suggesting crazy-paving pattern as another index to evaluate the disease course the study by song et al 42 concluded that greater consolidation indicated disease progression some case reports showed that smaller size extent and absorption of these lesions indicate the improvement 324251-53in conclusion characteristic chest ct imaging features and wuhan exposure or close contact history highly suggest covid-19 pneumonia although rt-pcr remains the reference standard typical ct features of covid-19 pneumonia include multifocal bilateral ggos with patchy consolidations prominent peripherally subpleural distribution and preferred posterior part or lower lobe predilection thin slice chest ct can help prompt diagnosis guide clinical decision making and monitor disease progression playing a critical role in the early prevention and control of covid-19 special attention should be paid to the role of radiologists in fighting this new infectious diseaseup to 1st of may 2020 more than 3000000 cases with covid-19 were diagnosed and 200000 death cases were recorded the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 first was reported in december 2019 in wuhan china it quickly spread to other districts in the country and a month later to other countries across the world impacting over 200 countries and territories covid-19 was reported to be a global emergency by the world health organization who in january 2020 and its outbreak was later declared to be a pandemic by the organization on march 2020 1 like other diseases that cause pneumonia including the middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars covid-19 can also cause acute respiratory distress syndrome ards2covid-19 was stated to have originated from wild bats and belongs to genera -coronavirus although covid-19 and sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov belong to the same -coronavirus the similarity at the genome level is only 70 and the new group has been reported to display genetic differences from sars-cov3almost all earlier cases had a history of contact with wuhan city and some cases present a family clustering character the exact source of covid-19 is still unknown nevertheless it is reported that the infection may have been induced by vipers or bats4 this novel virus exhibits high person-to-person transmissibility and typically infects animals including mammals and birds coronaviruses usually cause respiratory infections such as those detected in the common cold in patients however some new human coronavirus infections have caused lethal endemics including mers and sars endemics1 who in the first report projected about a 4 fatality rate for covid-19 however among hospitalized cases the fatality rate is about 415 1 5most of the covid-19 subjects are adults among 44672 cases in china 21 were below the age of twenty around 5 of patients experienced critically ill conditions and 14 experienced severe disease initial reports documented that disease severity was accompanied by age over 60 years and a history of a co-morbid condition rapid detection of covid-19 is vital to guarantee timely treatment and from a public health perspective quick isolation of the patient is essential to discontinue the cascade of contamination6coronaviruses covs belong to the subfamily coronavirinae in the family of coronaviridae of the order nidovirales and this subfamily includes four types named as    and  coronavirus7 covid-19 a -coronavirus with positive-sense single-stranded rna1 is an enveloped virion that appears as oval or round with 60-140nm diameter and is often polymorphous fig 1 and 2
 covid-19 is generally spread in humans and other mammals and its genome is more distant from sars-cov and mers-cov8coronavirus recombination rates are very high due to continuously appearing transcription errors and rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp jumps3 with a high mutation rate of coronaviruses they are zoonotic pathogens that are existing in humans and other mammalians with a varied range of clinical finding from asymptomatic feature to hospitalization in the intensive care unit icu leading to the infections in lungs gastrointestinal tract liver and central nervous system3aside from person-to-person close contact less than six feet distance and population mobility environmental factors could influence droplet transmission and survival of viruses currently subjects with covid-19 are known as the main source of disease frequently the transmission from person-to-person happens with close contact the transmission initially occurs through the respiratory droplets formed when a patient sneezes coughs or even talks just as in the spread of influenza and other respiratory viruses droplets can settle down in different parts of the body such as the mouth lungs and eyes of subjects through inhaled air 3 9 this disease can also be transmitted by touching a surface or an object that has the virus on it 3 10 moreover transmission may occur through fomites in the environment around the covid-19 patients it has been reported that covid-19 infection may lead to gastrointestinal infection and exist in stool hence covid-19 may also transmit via fecal-oral or body fluid routes consequently coronavirus transmission can occur by direct route close contact with covid-19 patients and indirect route surfaces in the immediate environment or equipment used by covid-19 patients table 1 and 2
 usually as with other types of respiratory pathogens it is accepted that the most contagious time is when subjects are most symptomatic however asymptomatic infections can act as a source of the disease 10 cases that were infected from asymptomatic subjects in the prodrome phase of covid-19 were also documented 10 at present based on limited findings there is no evidence of transmission of covid-19 from an infected pregnant mother to baby 11covid-19 was extensively distributed on hospital floors sickbed handrails trash cans and computer keyboard and mice the positive rate was relatively high for floor swab specimens icu 70 general covid-19 ward 154 maybe due to air flow and gravity causing most virus droplets to float to the ground furthermore as health workers walk around the ward the virus can be transferred all over the floor as shown by the 100 positive rate from the pharmacy floor where there were no covid-19 patients moreover 50 of the specimens from the soles of the intensive care unit icu staff shoes were positive hence the soles of shoes might act as potential carriers it has been proposed that staffs disinfect their shoe soles before walking out of wards containing infected subjects12while mers-cov regularly infects subjects aged above 50 years sars-cov infects younger individuals and covid-19 infects subjects at their middle age or above infected older men with co-morbid diseases were more likely to have lung disease because of severe alveolar injury indicating that men are more vulnerable than women 13 differences in sex hormones and immunity-linked genes on the x chromosome that affect both adaptive acquired and innate non-specific immune responses may describe the high vulnerability to covid-19 infection in males additionally there may be a higher possibility of virus exposure because of occupational risk which could be another factor responsible for higher male infection rate 14understanding the clinical manifestations is vital although these symptoms are nonspecific since december 2019 numerous collected subjects of unknown viral pneumonia have been reported originally related to wuhan city china2 overall many infected subjects with covid-19 have many clinical symptoms similar to a sars-cov infection14 it is reported that the clinical feature differs from simple lung infection findings to septic shock like mers-cov and sars-cov the first symptoms of covid-19 are usually explained as cough myalgia or fatigue shortness of breath and fever13 15 diarrhea was rarely documented in covid-19 infection while intestinal symptoms existed in approximately 20-25 of the subjects with sars-cov and mers-cov infection 3 some cases have complained of hemoptysis or headache while others were even relatively asymptomatic13 co-morbidities such as underlying cardiovascular disease hypertension and diabetes were reported in nearly half of the patients 3 the symptoms of acute respiratory infection appeared within the early stage of disease in the next stages septic shock metabolic acidosis coagulation dysfunction and ards8 can appear in severe cases 15the incubation period for covid-19 on average is 52 days but it is different among patients studies support a 14-day medical treatment period for subjects exposed to the pathogen13in sars subjects lung injury is often diagnosed in the first week from the symptom onset 16 then the lesions develop into peripheralsubpleural distribution bilateral involvement and posterior partlower lobe predilection mixed with ground-glass opacity ggo in the fourth week likewise pan et al2 in a cohort study showed 857 pneumonia progression including consolidation and ggo in early ct scans of patients with covid-19 notably there is asymptomatic pneumonia among some covid-19 patients therefore care must be taken for the diagnosis of such atypical subjects as they might be sources of public transmission16other types of pneumonia induced by streptococcus chlamydia mycoplasma and other coronavirus infections should be differentiated from covid-19 pneumonia it is very vital to separate suspected subjects with fever from the others early to reduce cross-infection respiratory symptoms in covid-19 including breathlessness and lung failure and constitutional symptoms such as fever muscle ache confusion and headache accompanied by diffuse heterogeneous consolidation with ggo13the history of exposure or close contact with suspected or confirmed patients is critical evidence for the diagnosis nevertheless for patients with an unknown history clinical features and imaging appearances can show suspected covid-19 after that the real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr test should be done in these cases as a reference standard13according to the national health commission nhc of china the diagnostic criteria are 1 history of exposure to cases with respiratory symptoms from wuhan or infected cities within two weeks before the onset of disease 2 clinical findings fever normal or decreased wbc count or reduced lymphocyte count andor imaging features of pneumonia and 3 real-time pcr showing positive results for covid-19 the confirmed covid-19 pneumonia case should be hospitalized and isolated for therapy2 based on the who recommendations for sars and mers the nhc of china proposed criteria for diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 pneumonia 13 a person with two clinical conditions and one contact history is regarded as a suspected patient without any clear contact history suspected cases should have three clinical features 13 the discharge criteria were 1 afebrile for more than 3 days 2 significant improvement of respiratory symptoms and 3 improvement in the imaging abnormalities of the chest the definitive etiology diagnosis of infection is needed which can be made stronger by pcr assay using blood or lung specimen or by viral gene sequencing based on the clinical findings approved subjects are divided into different classes including critical severe moderate and mild13about nearly half of the patients infected with covid-19 had a reduced wbc count and lymphopenia reduced lymphocytes or thrombocytopenia low blood platelet count with increased activated thromboplastin time c-reactive protein crp levels were increased in most patients but procalcitonin pct concentrations were normal8 elevated serum ferritin levels reported in some patients14 all these alterations further explained that covid-19 may exert a potential effect on lymphocytes especially t cells covid-19 outbreaks and invades via lung mucosa stimulates inflammation cascades and motivates a cytokine storm resulting in alteration in immune response such as peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes hence intravenous immunoglobulin was applied in most subjects with reduced wbc and lymphocyte count8 augmented serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels have also been documented and are associated with the severity of the disease nevertheless elevated levels of interleukin-10 which is known as an anti-inflammatory cytokine indicate a diverse pattern from that of sars-cov infection14 some patients showed increased liver enzymes and glucose levels and few patients exhibited abnormal muscle enzymes liver test abnormality of covid-19 may not be induced by liver cell damage but by

should be monitored in patients 17 furthermore subjects having upper respiratory tract symptoms and fever with leukopenia or lymphopenia should be suspected particularly for cases with close contact or exposure history18radiological evaluations particularly thin slice chest computed tomography ct scan have a critical role in diagnosis management and follow-up of covid-19 infections 18 radiologists play the main role in the outbreak of covid-19 early diagnosis of the imaging abnormality could offer suspect pneumonia in cases at risk although the final detection of covid-19 is based on rt-pcr the findings of imaging are vital for pneumonia detection16 ct scans are proposed in cases with suspicious lung abnormalities appropriate recognition of covid-19 pneumonia could provide quick management and follow-ups lung imaging shows the severity of covid-19 therefore physicians should be informed about radiological reports clinical findings from covid-19 cases with high abnormality shown in the ct scan who were admitted to the icu 16 show that on admission these patients frequently showed subsegmental consolidation and bilateral multiple lobular whereas ct reports from non-icu patients showed subsegmental consolidation and bilateral ground-glass opacity ggo 15 in severe infection imaging can confirm heterogeneous consolidation with ggos in bilateral lungs and bronchiectasis indicating as white lung when most lobes of the lung are affected19 furthermore covid-19 cases might show intralobular septal thickening and bilateral pleura along with little pleural effusion 13 ct scanning enables recognition of the initial phase of respiratory infection and provides opportunity for a quick public health care response 20 slice chest ct has been shown as the main evidence for approved findings since chest radiography is not sensitive for the diagnosis of ggo and might show normal results in the initial stage of disease20 it is not considered as the first-line imaging method for covid-19 nevertheless bilateral multifocal consolidation can be observed in severe cases partially fused into high consolidation with minor pleural effusions and even showing with white lung 13 in this respect the thin slice chest ct test is more useful for the early diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia 18 20 high-resolution computed tomography hrct can detect ggos more easily in the early stage4 a study with a large sample size 3665 confirmed cases of the disease has reported that 955 of cases were detected as pneumonia pan et al 2 conducted an experiment with 21 approved covid-19 cases who underwent repeated ct with about 4-day intervals and observed negative results in four cases in the initial stages 0-4 days after onset of the early symptom but repeated ct displayed abnormalities in the lung in all of these four patientsthe usual imaging features of covid-19 pneumonia include interstitial inflammation extensive consolidation with multifocal bilateral ggos bilateral involvement noticeable peripheral or subpleural distribution posterior part or lower lobe predilection and multiple lesions 13 nevertheless certain cases with covid-19 pneumonia regularly revealed no respiratory distress or hypoxemia during the course of hospitalization2 furthermore since the ct scan results of covid-19 overlap with other viral pneumonia rt-pcr assay is strongly recommended for rapid detection and treatment4according to the pan et al report the cases who recovered from this pneumonia due to covid-19 experienced four stages based on their ct results 1 early stage 0-4 days that shows small ggo distributed subpleurally in the lower part 2 progressive stage 5-8 days with infection quickly extended to a bilateral multi-lobe with diffused ggo consolidation and crazy-paving pattern 3 peak stage 10-13 days that shows slowly expanding of the involved part to the peak involvement including diffused ggo crazy-paving pattern residual parenchymal bands and consolidation and finally 4 absorption stage which occurs two weeks after the onset of first symptoms and shows that the disease is managed and the consolidation is slowly absorbed fig 3
and table 4
 no crazy-paving signs exist anymore nevertheless in this step widespread ggo can be observed as an indication of the consolidation absorption according to the ct scores the absorption step extended beyond 26 days after the onset of the first symptom 2the most common detection assay is rt-pcr based on the rna isolated from respiratory specimens such as oropharyngeal swabs sputum nasopharyngeal aspirate bronchoalveolar lavage or deep tracheal aspirate3at the moment the rt-pcr method is used in clinics to confirm the covid-19 infection while this assay remains the reference standard to the detection of covid-19 the high false-negative rt-pcr results 21 and inapplicability of rt-pcr in the initial phase of the disease limited the rapid diagnosis of infected subjects13 it has been reported that the sensitivity of chest ct was superior to that of rt-pcr 98 vs 71 respectively the causes for the low effectiveness of viral nucleic acid measurement might include low viral load inappropriate sample variation in the diagnosis rate among different kits and undeveloped technology for detection of the nucleic acid22 lower respiratory tract sample bronchoalveolar lavage fluid deep tracheal aspirates and induced sputum has the highest genome fraction and viral load compared to upper respiratory tract samples which are optimal for improving detection accuracy3 nevertheless with sample collection and transportation and kit quality the total positive rate of rt-pcr for throat swab specimens was about 60 at initial presentation in different studies table 5
 23 24the positive rate of chest ct imaging and rt-pcr assay in a cohort study by ai et al23 was 88 and 59 for the detection of suspected subjects with covid-19 respectively they showed that chest ct imaging had higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of the covid-19 infection as compared with initial rt-pcr from swab samples they also reported that 42 of infected subjects exhibited improvement of follow-up chest ct scans before the rt-pcr finding turning negative23xie et al 25 evaluating 167 infected cases showed that 3 5167 of patients had negative rt-pcr while they had positive chest ct pcr procedure for covid-19 may be falsely negative because of a laboratory error inappropriate sample or inadequate viral load in the sample the chest ct gives fast results is easy to do and enables quick diagnoses of initial covid-19 pneumonia13the covid-19 spreads and invades via the lung stimulates inflammation and induces a cytokine storm leading to alteration in immune cells such as wbcs and lymphocytes accordingly administration of intravenous immunoglobulins is being used as the therapeutic strategy for most subjects with decreased levels of wbcs and lymphocytes8covid-19 patients are susceptible to liver failure since covid-19 directly binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 positive bile duct cells 26 it has been shown that ace2 is protective against several lung diseases including ards asthma acute lung injury ali chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and pulmonary hypertension27 ace2 has also been demonstrated to be the receptor for both the sars-cov and the human respiratory coronavirus nl63 the previous experiment established the positive correlation of ace2 expression and the infection of sars-cov in vitro 28 sars-cov significantly decreased ace2 protein expression after infecting the host 28 consequently the ace2 expression in different organs might be vital for the vulnerability signs and outcome of covid-19 an analysis of single-cell rna-sequencing rna-seq showed that asian males might have higher ace2 expression levels28ace2 is one of the components of the renin angiotensin system ras which regulates blood pressure systemic vascular resistance and electrolyte balance in the respiratory system local lung ras activation can influence the pathogenesis of lung damage through numerous mechanisms including elevation of vascular permeability and changes in alveolar epithelial cells in this cascade renin increases angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin i ang i a decapeptide hormone29 the ace hydrolyzes ang i to angiotensin ii the angiotensin ii binds to its receptors and induces vasoactive effects ace2 catalyzes ang i and ang ii to generate angiotensin-19 and ang-17 respectively and antagonizes several effects of ang ii ace2 by reducing local ang ii levels acts as a counter-regulatory enzyme29 30 ace2 deficiency and the consequent high ang ii concentration lead to increased vascular permeability neutrophil accumulation pulmonary oedema disruption of gas exchange and exacerbation in lung function on the other hand active recombinant ace2 protein alleviates ali symptoms in ace2 knockout animals31 in the lungs ras activity is basically high and the activity of the ace2 is also highly increased to control the balance of ang iiang-17 concentration29 30 it has been shown that ace2 participates in the severe ali and failure that is induced by sars influenza a h5n1 virus acid aspiration sepsis and lethal avian currently ace2 is proposed as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ali in humans 32in animal models of ards ace2 knockout animals showed more severe symptoms whereas the upregulation of the ace2 has protective effects in animals infected by sars-cov both the viral spike protein and replication protein alone can decrease ace2 but not ace expression furthermore sars-cov also motivates quick ace2 downregulation from the cell surface these findings suggest that the sars-cov interrupts the physiological balance between aceace2 and ang iiang-1729 consequently high ang ii concentration in the lung tissue aggravates acid-induced acute lung injury and causes severe lung failure likewise the spike protein of covid-19 interacts with ace2 and the pathogenic mechanism might probably be shared between sars-cov and covid-19 29healthcare workers are on the front lines of battling covid-19 which puts them at high risk of covid-19 infection occupational safety and health administration osha has separated job tasks into four risk exposure levels as presented in figure 4
 since covid-19 spreads quickly through respiratory droplets head and neck surgeons who have close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract are principally at high risk given the high number of surgeries done worldwide it is essential for the surgeons and surgical team to be adequately protected from coronavirus transmission in the covid19 patients who need surgery risks versus benefits of the procedure for the patient should be cautiously evaluated the surgeon may temporarily postpone an emergency or urgent surgery on cases which show coronavirus symptoms eg cough sore throat fever for all suspected cases that are undergoing operation chest ct and blood tests need to be checked before admission the surgical team can also order an in-house rt-pcr assay within 24h if the subjects condition does not allow for a 24h wait the patient is assumed to be covid-19-positive for suspected or confirmed covid-19 cases non-operative management is preferred if surgery is essential in these subjects suitable personal protective equipment ppe should be used fig 5
 furthermore they should remove their ppe and place the ppe in a labelled waste bag in an anteroom there are various levels of emergency related to covid-19 patient needs and assessment is required to distinguish between them table 6
summarizes the key recommendations for the surgeon and surgical team in different stages 33 34 35currently there is no effective medicine for the treatment for covid-19 patients which can in some patients lead to lethal lung failure furthermore there is no specific antiviral medicine or vaccine for this virus8 pathogenesis of coronavirus is an extremely complex process and much of the required details of host-pathogen interaction remain unknown discovering the useful medicine options for the treatment of the covid-19 outbreak is vital 36 37 table 7
 there are various possible treatment approaches 29 including i raising of ace2 expression by injection of soluble recombinant ace2 protein or using therapeutic vectors expressing high levels of ace2 which may be applicable in the future38 ii using specific ace inhibitors such as lisinopril and iii inhibiting ang ii receptors in particular the type i ang ii receptor has been reported to promote disease by motivating edemas and disturbing lung function38 hence a type i ang ii receptor blocker eg losartan has been successively examined for improving covid-19 pneumonia29 treatment with a soluble form of ace2 probably acts as a competitive interceptor of coronavirus by inhibiting binding of the viral particle to the ace2 receptor which can consequently slow coronavirus entry into the cells and protect against lung injury remdesivir adenosine analogue which is used for the treatment of the ebola disease is incorporated in the nascent chains of viral rna causing premature termination this drug is currently used for the treatment of covid-19 infection randomized trial studies have reported the safety and efficacy of interferon- 5 million u per time twice a day and lopinavir-ritonavir two capsules each time twice a day in covid-19 patients 39 wang et al determined the efficacy of some fda-approved drugs such as penciclovir ribavirin nitazoxanide chloroquine nafamostat and favipiravir t-705 for treatment of covid-19 infection in vitro40 they found that chloroquine and remdesivir are potentially effective for the control of covid-19 infection in vitro 40 chloroquine is a well-known drug that has currently been documented as a strong broad-spectrum antiviral agent for the treatment of malarial and autoimmune disease this drug interferes with glycosylation of the cellular receptor elevates endosomal ph needed for viruscell fusion and consequently reduces virus infection41 the use of traditional medicine to recover the physical signs of cases has also been recommended by some chinese researchers8 luo et al showed that some chinese medicines such as lonicerae japonicae flos jinyinhua radix saposhnikoviae fangfeng radix glycyrrhizae gancao fructus forsythia lianqiao and rhizoma atractylodis macrocephalae baizhu are useful in the prevention of covid-19 42 some other herbal plants through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity might be considered as useful agents in the treatment of covid-19 infection 43 44 45 46 furthermore zinc nanoparticles due to their potential antioxidant anti-inflammatory 47 and antiviral effects have been found to inhibit influenza viral load and covid-19 replication in an in vitro experiment 48isolation of infected cases and supportive cares such as fluid management oxygen therapy and antimicrobials agents for the treatment of secondary bacterial infections and prevention of end-organ dysfunction are suggested by the who for patients needing hospital admission 8 10 interferon- is a wide spectrum antivirus medicine that can be used for the treatment of hepatitis b virus hbv lopinavir is a protease inhibitor used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency viruses hiv with ritonavir as a booster that showed potential anti-coronavirus activity patients with sars treated with lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin had a lower risk of ards or death as compared with ribavirin alone 49 beck et al used some antiviral drugs including arbidol lopinavirritonavir and shufeng jiedu capsule sfjdc herbal medicine for the treatment of four cases with mild or severe covid-19 pneumonia after the drug therapy the cases showed noticeable improvement and were discharged from the hospital39some covid-19 infected patients might have co-infections with fungi and bacteria chen et al detected some bacteria and fungi as secondary infections including klebsiella pneumonia acinetobacter baumannii aspergillus flavus candida albicans and candida glabrata they showed that acinetobacter baumannii has a high drug resistance rate causing the possibility of septic shock50 the host immune system is one of the main factors in secondary infections other factors involved which may increase mortality in covid-19 patients are obesity old age diabetics hiv infection autoimmune disease and pregnancy in women50 therefore early diagnosis and timely treatment of these critical patients to prevent secondary infection are necessary immunoglobulin injection is recommended to increase the anti-infection drug ability for severe cases 50 furthermore paracetamol 400mg per time every 8h when required is recommended in patients with high temperature 9 37in summary at present there are no vaccines and specific antiviral medicine for the treatment of covid-19 all of the recommended drugs come from the knowledge gained by treating mers sars or another family of coronavirus further researches are required to provide evidences of the effectiveness of these drugsno

statement dont required for this review articlethe author declared no interestsa new coronavirus sars-cov-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 with worldwide cases of transmission occurring shortly after the initial infections were reported 1 2 on january 30 2020 the international health regulations emergency committee of the world health organization who declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern pheic and on march 11th the who officially designated the outbreak as a pandemic by march 31 2020 all continents had reported confirmed cases of covid-19 the global spread of the virus is ongoing and fast-moving figure 1a with over 750890 confirmed infections and 36405 deaths worldwide the global cases-fatality rate is 485 with differences in different countries and areas suggesting that reasonable and effective medical interventions can have a great impact figures 1b 2 worryingly covid-19 cases have now been identified in a number of countries with lower access to health care resources including 39 african countries and others 3 another concern is potential spread among healthcare workers who by nature of their professions are at an especially high risk of exposure in china more than 3000 health care workers in hubei province have been infected with most being doctors from non-infectious disease departments 4 a total of 34 confirmed deaths among infected healthcare workers in china have been identified as of march 2 2020 5 per the italian national health agency 9512 healthcare works have been infected as of march 31th 2020identifying cases of covid-19 and controlling its spread can be difficult as sars-cov-2 is infectious during the incubation period 6 7 latency from infection to disease manifestation varies from 1 to 14 days and no or atypical symptoms may appear in its early stages 8 9 it can be easily confused with other common diseases in its early stage leading to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis and subsequent nosocomial spread of disease this is a major reason for the large number of infections among healthcare workers in both italy and the city of wuhan therefore the early identification of covid-19 patients is critical at the same time controlling covid-19 requires the joint efforts of multiple clinical departments accordingly it is very important to protect healthcare workers with different levels of standardized protective measures utilized commensurate to exposure riskwe descriptively reviewed the english and chinese literature from december 2019 through to march 31st 2020 the pubmed and google scholar databases were searched with the terms covid-19 2019-ncov sars-cov-2 and novel coronavirus pneumonia in order to identify studies for inclusion the purpose of this review is to provide current information on the characteristics of sars-cov-2 infection and standardized screening triage and protection protocols in order to ensure the early identification of covid-19 and protection of healthcare workersthe exact origin of the sars-cov-2 has not yet been established possibilities include a bat coronavirus termed batcov ratg13 which shares 962 of its genome sequence with sars-cov-2 though two other similar bat-derived coronaviruses have also been identified 10 however no evidence of direct bat to human transmission has been reported leading to the suggestion that minks pangolins snakes and other wild animals may serve as candidate intermediate hosts to transmit the virus to humans 1113sars-cov-2 is a single positive strand rna 60140 nm in diameter sars-cov-2 has 946 key region orf1ab homology with sars-cov indicating the two derive from the same species 10 however the s protein of sars-cov-2 binds with human ace2 with a much higher affinity than the s protein of sars-cov the main reason for the strong infectivity of the new coronavirus 14 15 in addition research findings suggest that sars-cov-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of cd147-spike protein sp 16 this possible mechanism for the entry of sars-cov-2 into the cells may provide important information for vaccine development and targeted drug research 15based on analysis of data from a large number of clinical cases the median incubation period of covid-19 is 464 days with a basic reproductive number r0 of 22268 17 18in addition to patients demonstrating the full covid-19 disease phenotype mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are also a source of infection 6 sars-cov-2 is spread through respiratory transmission via exhaled droplets 10 touching the mouth nose or eyes after contact with virus-contaminated materials may lead to covid-19 transmission 19 there is a possibility of airborne transmission when exposed to high concentrations of the aerosolized virus in a relatively closed environment for an extended time figure 3 20 sars-cov-2 transmission through the digestive tract may also be possible but needs further confirmation 21 compared to sars which only affects the respiratory tract sars-cov-2 can multiply effectively in the nose and throat 7 22 recent data provides no evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission in pregnant women who are infected with covid-19 23typical clinical symptoms of covid-19 are fever 83986 8 17 24 25 cough 59482 8 17 24 25 and fatigue 381696 8 17 24 however clinical data suggests that only 438 of patients have fever at the early stages of the sars-cov-2 infection 17 and some patients presented with uncommon symptoms such as increased sputum 154337 8 17 24 25 shortness of breath 18731 17 25 sore throat 5174 8 17 25 nasal congestion 48 17 dizziness 94 8 and diarrhea 2101 8 17 24 25patients with a mild form of the disease presented with only a low fever mild fatigue and no pneumonia with some patients demonstrating no obvious fever throughout the course of the disease this makes clinical diagnosis difficult in this patient population however 7332 of patients progress to a severe dyspnea respiratory frequency 30min blood oxygen saturation 93 partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio 300 mmhg or lung infiltrates 50 within 2448 h or critical respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure condition 8 9 17 24 26 the median time from onset of symptoms to icu admission was 95105 days 8 24 26according to our experience treating cases in wuhan severe and critically ill patients demonstrate the following patterns 1 clinical deterioration happens suddenly and is difficult to predict acute respiratory failure especially acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is very common in covid-19 severe and critically ill patients however compared to previous severe infectious diseases such as sars or merswhere ards often appeared within 1 week of symptom onsetpatients with covid-19 showed greater variance in timing many patients were stable for more than a week and even up to a month before acute respiratory failure or ards suddenly occurred within a 23 days period this makes it difficult for clinicians to predict critical changes in a patients condition once such patients have respiratory failure they require a prompt upgrade in respiratory support and close observation in order to continue to escalate treatment as necessary the mortality rate of all covid-19 patients with ards is close to 50 and if ards reaches the moderate to severe stages the mortality rate is as high as 70 27 2 multisystem organ failure from the current epidemiological data the majority of middle-aged and elderly patients with covid-19 are critically ill 8 17 26 and dysfunction of multiple organ systems including respiratory failure heart failure and renal failure can occur either individually at different time points or simultaneously 8 9 25 26 therefore it is necessary to frequently and comprehensively evaluate these critically ill patients with attention paid to each individual organ system and 3 multiple comorbidities often exist in severe patients multiple chronic diseases such as diabetes hypertension ckd and parkinsons are frequently found in severe or critically ill patients 8 9 17 26 these diseases often contribute to the course of covid-19 for example diabetic patients are at high risk for ketoacidosis during covid-19 infection ckd patients often have further deterioration of renal function requiring rrt treatment and neurological diseases such as parkinsons compromise airway protection and the ability for patients to cooperate with treatment therefore clinicians need to closely evaluate patients comorbidities and provide additional disease-specific care while diagnosing and treating covid-19on laboratory testing peripheral blood leukocyte counts are low or normal and lymphocyte counts are low severe and critically ill patients often have elevated inflammatory factors in early ct chest imaging there were multiple small patchy and interstitial changes which then develop into multiple ground glass opacities and infiltrates in the lungs consistent with viral pneumonia in severe cases pulmonary consolidation can occur but pleural effusions are rarethe clinical manifestations and illness onset of covid-19 overlap with or resemble the clinical manifestations of many other diseases including the common cold influenza and other upper respiratory infections uris table 1 some patients who have atypical symptoms or no fever may present to non-infectious disease departments which may lead to missed or delayed diagnosis healthcare worker infection and even nosocomial infections in other patients the cdc has published primers probes and testing protocols but there were initially issues with the test kits performance and distribution that prevented a scaling up of testing beyond a few public health laboratories 28 after corrections the cdc re-released testing protocols that are now being utilized by state and local health departments the differential diagnosis at the onset of symptoms mainly depends on epidemiological history complaints symptoms and corresponding examinations therefore maintaining a high level of suspicion for early clinical manifestations of covid-19 and using existing testing to rule out other respiratory viruses is necessary to ensure that patients receive appropriate early molecular testingsome patients with atypical symptoms or no fever may initially present to non-infectious disease departments such as otolaryngology stomatology and gastroenterology which are not standardly equipped to safely handle these patients in addition many countries do not have a hierarchical medical system in such countries patients decide on their own as to which hospitals and departments to present this poses considerable risks to healthcare workers and other patients in these hospitals successful disease control requires a systematic comprehensive approach to diagnosis triage and treatment outpatient and emergency pre-check is the first step to prevent and control the potential spread of covid-19 in healthcare settings by initially screening patients by obtaining a temperature inquiring about the epidemiological history and triaging according to predetermined symptoms suspected cases can be identified suspected cases should be isolated and reported immediately in addition medical staff in consultation with local public health authorities should collect the necessary specimens for example nasopharyngeal swab for covid-19 nucleic acid detection in a timely fashion if the patients condition requires supportive care in an intensive care unit he or she should be placed in an isolation negative pressure room if such an area is not available then the patient should be transferred to a facility that can provide this care after the patients condition is stabilized figure 4 29designated institutions such as fever clinics in china and infectious disease departments in other countries have been established in order to ensure routine and appropriate infection control operations for covid-19 cases however in healthcare settings where patients with emerging or unknown infectious diseases are diagnosed and treated especially in those countries where there is no designated institution for covid-19 cases infection control methods against severe infectious diseases are often imperfect with the outbreak of covid-19 healthcare workers are at particular risk for infection due to their potential exposure to droplets or aerosols from the respiratory tracts of patientsfor providing clinical care to patients with covid-19 all healthcare workers are recommended to receive standardized infection prevention and control ipc training and wear correct personal protective equipment ppe eg medical masks such as surgical masks or n-95 respirators depending on exposure risk disposable isolation gowns disposable patient examination gloves working hat goggles or face shield and shoe covers 30in the epidemic area considering it is not always possible to identify patients with sars-cov-2 infection because early symptoms are non-specific it is important that healthcare workers use standard precautions consistently when providing care to patients refresher training on ipc should be provided to every healthcare worker 31 healthcare workers should practice donning and doffing procedures and must demonstrate competency through testing and assessment before caring for patients 32 this is particularly true of frontline providers such as those in the infectious disease and emergency departments as well as providers in departments who may have higher occupational exposure risks when conducting special examinations on patients such as the departments of otorhinolaryngology stomatology gastroenterology and pulmonology among others healthcare workers in these departments should pay extra attention to proper protection and specialty or exam specific protective protocols should be developed 10 for example nasopharyngeal swab specimen collection is a common and simple disease detection method but it has certain exposure risks such as causing patients to sneeze it must be performed in accordance with protection as described above face-to-face sampling with the patient should be avoided as much as possible recommended precautions include having the patient take a seated position with the health worker standing to the patients side staggered head distance standing upwind of the patient and securing the patients head with one hand while using the other hand for sampling 33 it is also critical for providers in generally uninvolved departments to pay attention to patients with fever respiratory symptoms and appropriate epidemiological history as these may represent unscreened casesas seen in previous epidemics healthcare workers may have a higher risk of developing psychological issues they may experience fear of contagion and spreading the virus to their families friends or colleagues 34 those with previous first-line care experience such as during the sars epidemics may also be at higher risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms this could trigger common mental disorders including anxiety and depressive disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder that requires psychological intervention however further research is necessary to better assess the short- and long-term psychological consequences of this epidemic on healthcare workersit is important that hospital administrators be cognizant of the additional stressors faced by healthcare workers provide appropriate training and protective equipment manage work hours carefully and implement quality of life measures to minimize burnout and risk of psychological consequences in addition safe communication channels between healthcare workers and their families should be set up and psychological treatment plans progress reports and health status updates should be given to them and their families 35there are currently no specific antiviral drugs to treat sars-cov-2 infection the treatment mainly includes supportive care including supplemental oxygen symptom directed therapy and the reduction of complications disease directed treatments that have been tried includes antivirals such a remdesivir and lopinavirritonavir drugs such as chloroquine phosphate and abidol and chinese traditional medicines 24 on the chinese clinical trial registry1 a total of 473 clinical trials are registered evaluating a variety of different drugs and other treatment modalities in the united states the national institutes of health nih has started a clinical trial utilizing the experimental broad-spectrum antiviral drug remdesivir launched on february 21 36 the use of corticosteroid treatment is currently controversial 37 38 vaccines are under development in several countries around the world which should help to contain the spread of covid-19 in the futurein our review we analyze current information on the characteristics of sars-cov-2 infection and provide implementable approaches to standardized screening triage personal protection protocols and psychological support for healthcare workers that are relevant to a variety of healthcare settings as is the case with any review of a rapidly evolving topic such as covid-19 it is impossible to be fully current as new studies and guidelines are published on a daily basis likewise this is a descriptive review rather than a systematic review which limits the strength of the overall conclusions that can be drawn from the included studies however we believe this review provides a coherent widely applicable framework for addressing these issues one that can be modified as new information and new discoveries continue to come to light this is particularly necessary for the issues of psychological support and treatment as at the current time there is not enough outcome data available to make true evidence-based recommendations finally while we review best practice ppe use specific ppe choices may require modification depending on shortages overall access to health care resources and specific applicationcovid-19 has spread rapidly and progressed quickly to a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality however through early patient identification and accurate triage risk of widespread transmission can be greatly decreased special attention must be paid to minimizing the additional risks faced by healthcare workers in order to ensure that appropriate care can continue to be providedpotential covid-19 cases must be identified early to initiate proper triage and distinguish them from similar infections early identification accurate triage and standardized personal protection protocols can reduce the risk of cross infection containing disease spread will require protecting healthcare workersys xl yz and cc contributions to conception and design and analysis and

issued by the world health organization who in march 2001 who 2003 one of the largest outbreaks occurred in singapore with most of the patients managed in a single sarsdesignated hospital mortality in patients requiring intensive care unit icu management was very high lew et al 2003 the cause of sars has been identified as a novel coronavirus drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 peiris et al 2003athe who clinical case definition of sars is highly insensitive highlighting the nonspecific nature of presenting symptoms rainer et al 2003 although sequencing of the coronavirus genome marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 has allowed the development of more specific diagnostic tests none of these are fully validated and widely available during the sars outbreak tremendous burden was placed on hospitals to provide isolation facilities because of the highly infectious nature of the coronavirus it would be helpful if some routine laboratory tests could help to stratify patients with compatible clinical features early to allow for efficient use of limited isolation facilities furthermore early identification of patients with a poor prognosis may allow early intervention to improve outcomein a large cohort of confirmed sars cases we retrospectively analysed their haematological parameters with the aims of describing changes in these parameters as the infection progressed identifying early haematological markers helpful in excluding sars and predicting patients needing icu admissiona retrospective review of sars cases confirmed by serological testing or identification of viral rna by reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction rtpct from 15 march to 12 may 2003 was conducted the following patients were excluded from the final analysis patients not treated at the sarsdesignated hospital patient 9 years old and patients whose history of symptom onset is unclear the study was approved by the hospitals ethics review boardthe patients were divided into two groups those admitted to icu and those not sequential results of haematological indices including haemoglobin hb white cell wcc platelet absolute neutrophil anc and absolute lymphocyte counts alc were obtained for each patient and tabulated according to day of illness the day of symptom onset is designated day 1 of illness other data collected include demographics comorbid conditions chronic airways disease cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus acute or chronic renal failure and days from symptom onset to hospital admission and icu admissionthe median and range were calculated for each haematological parameter for predictors of icu admission the maximum or minimum value whichever appropriate from days 2 to 5 was used and potential predictors were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis data analysis was carried out in stata v70 statacorp lp college station tx usa and level of significance was set at 5a total of 185 confirmed sars cases met

haematological indices at different stages of infection is presented in table 2although leucopenia wcc  4  109l occurred in 197 and 50 of patients with available blood tests by days 5 and 10 of symptom onset respectively severe neutropenia anc  1  109l was rare 16 and 5 of patients by days 5 and 10 respectively a wcc  2  109l was also rare affecting only 33 of patients and only occurring after day 5 of illness most patients 615 by day 5 and 806 by day 10 developed moderate lymphopenia alc  1  109l at some point during the first 10 days of illness however severe lymphopenia alc  05  109l was rare occurring in only 98 and 189 of patients by days 5 and 10 of symptoms respectively reactive lymphocytes commonly seen in viral infections were also conspicuously absent in patients with sarsthe majority of patients had a normal platelet count 150  109l 883 of patients never had a platelet count  150  109l in fact none of the 122 patients who were tested during the first 5 days of illness had a platelet count  80  109l by day 10 of illness only two of 180 patients 11 tested had a platelet count  80  109lby plotting the median values for each haematological parameter over a period of 12 days from symptom onset time trends for changes to hb wcc platelet count anc and alc were obtained figure 1the hb for both groups continued to fall during the first 12 days of illness graph not shown the wcc initially decreased reaching a nadir at day 7 or 8 of illness the median nadir wcc was 4  109l range 212  109l for nonicu and 2145  109l for icu group for both groups changes in the anc reflected changes in the wcc the median nadir anc was 266  109l range 108885  109l for the nonicu group and higher for the icu group at 28  109l range 129127  109la striking feature of the alc graphs was the lack of lymphocyte recovery in the icu group for nonicu patients the alc reached a nadir at day 8 of illness at a median level of 079  109l range 027191  109l but the nadir had not been reached by day 12 of symptoms for the icu groupthe platelet trend followed that of wcc and anc the platelet count reached a nadir at day 6 of illness for the nonicu group and day 7 of illness for the icu group with median nadir platelet count of 161  109l range 81377  109l and 151  109l range 61314  109l respectivelyin the univariate analysis sex age presence of comorbid conditions wcc and anc were found to be significant predictors of icu admission table 3 however in the multivariate analysis only age was significantsars is an emerging infectious disease with many aspects of its pathophysiology and clinical behaviour still not fully understood this has hampered progress in its diagnosis and effective management one of the main symptoms of sars is fever fever is also common in other viral infections including dengue which is very common in asia where the possibility of another sars outbreak exists due to the highly infectious nature of the coronavirus every febrile patient suspected of sars screened at the screening centre need to be isolated this led to a high demand for isolation beds which is a limited resource in most acute care hospitals during the sars outbreak furthermore the more specific serological test only becomes positive late in the course of the disease peiris et al 2003b whilst rtpcr for the coronavirus rna have a detection rate of 79 and 80 in nasopharyngeal aspirate and plasma respectively during the first 3 days of illness grant et al 2003 poon et al 2003 any laboratory features in the first few days of fever that could suggest that the patient is unlikely to have sars may obviate the need to isolate them in hospitalwe chose to study haematological indices as they are common laboratory investigations performed on patients admitted to hospitals with fever blood counts often provide useful clues regarding the diagnosis and complications of infectious disease some interesting observations were madein the first 5 days of illness the majority of patients had a normal wcc with an elevated anc and lymphopenia and a normal hb and platelet count in this period 615 of patients in our cohort had a moderate lymphopenia 1  109l although only 98 had alc  05  109l this is comparable with other reported figures of 696 and 54 booth et al 2003 lee et al 2003 the more recent hong kong study reported that 98 of their patients have moderate lymphopenia during the course of their illness wong et al 2003 this is comparable with our figure of 81 of patients having moderate lymphopenia by day 10 of illness one of the notable features in sars was that reactive lymphocytes were not commonly seen in the peripheral blood film this contrasts with the common finding of reactive lymphocytes around the fourth and fifth day of fever in dengue which coincided with the recovery of the lymphocyte counts in these patients thisyakorn et al 1984the two hong kong studies reported thrombocytopenia 150  109l in 448 of patients on presentation and 55 of patients during the course of their illness respectively lee et al 2003 wong et al 2003 but this was not a feature in our patients only 116 of our patients had a platelet count  150  109l by day 10 of illness in fact within the first 5 days of illness no patients had a platelet count  80  109l or a wcc  2  109l by day 10 only two patients had a platelet count  80  109l one of these patients had preexisting hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis the source of these differences between our study and the hong kong studies is uncertain and may be due to different variants of the coronavirus ruan et al 2003 exerting different effects on the patients or differences in treatment and study design in contrast to our patients the hong kong patients were routinely treated with prednisolone and ribavarin which may affect platelet and white cell count choi et al 2003 the analysis from hong kong included results from patients even after they were admitted to icu we only included blood results prior to icu admission this made our results more reflective of changes as a result of the coronavirus infection as they are not affected by the treatment giventhe absence of significant thrombocytopenia contrasted with patients with dengue who commonly has significant thrombocytopenia including severe thrombocytopenia 30  109l during the first week of illness nimmannitya 1987 it would seem that patients presenting with severe thrombocytopenia 80  109l and a febrile illness are unlikely to have sars the same applies to patients presenting with a wcc  2  109l these parameters may therefore be helpful in stratification of febrile patients suspected of sars into low and highrisk groups and allow better allocation of the limited isolation rooms availablesome early and late differences were observed in the various haematological parameters between the icu and nonicu groups there is a clear difference in the median values of the hb wcc and anc at day 3 and 4 of illness figure 1 the association of these parameters with icu admission was tested in a logistic regression model incorporating other parameters like age and comorbidities previously shown to have prognostic value booth et al 2003 lee et al 2003in the univariate analysis sex age presence of comorbid conditions wcc and anc were found to be significant predictors however only age remained significant in the multivariate model the recent hong kong study also failed to identify any haematological parameters predictive of icu admission or death on multivariate analysis wong et al 2003 our results contrasted with other studies that also identified elevated anc lee et al 2003 and comorbid conditions booth et al 2003 as independent predictors of poor outcome however these studies may not be directly comparable as we use the day of illness onset as our basis for data analysis rather than the day of presentationlate differences from days 7 to 12 of symptom onset included a greater increase in the wcc and the anc following the nadir and lack of recovery in the alc by day 12 of illness in the icu group these differences may be a reflection of the greater severity of infection in the icu group whether the persistent lymphopenia in the icu group is as a result of the inability of these patients to mount an immune response resulting in more serious infection or because of bone marrow suppression caused by the virus is unknownthis detailed study of haematological changes in one of the largest cohort of sars patients managed in a single institution is strengthened by the use of the day of illness as the basis for data analysis compared with the day of presentation used by previous studies booth et al 2003 lee et al 2003 this method removes the confounding effect caused by variation in the day of presentation as laboratory measurements were not taken every day one limitation of the study is the amount of missing data that could bias our resultsin conclusion most haematological indices follow a vshaped pattern in sars an exception is the icu group who had not recovered their alc by day 12 of symptoms a platelet count  80  109l and a wcc  2  109l were not encountered in any sars patient in the first 5 days of illness moderate lymphopenia is common but alc  05  109l was uncommon in the early phase of the illness the absence of reactive lymphocytes is another important feature distinguishing sars from other viral infections these features may be helpful in the early stratification of patients with clinical features compatible with sars into a low risk group possibly obviating the need for isolationmore than 571678 people have been infected by covid-19 and the death toll has reached 26494 as of march 28th 2020 with 62514 new daily cases reported in 24 h and deaths of 3159 worldwide 1 after the initial epidemic appeared in china it spread to dozens of other countries coronavirus disease covid-19 which is caused by a novel pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused the current global pandemic 2 during this pandemic the most critical questions aroused pertains to patients and clinicians in understanding how the disease spread to cause an epidemic what its clinical presentation with a severity profile is what assessment or diagnostic measures should be used and what projected treatments and influences to prognosis and recurrence there arecovid-19 has threatened the entire world for the health services providers it became a challenge to make rapid forward planning to evaluate the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 without ready access to diagnostic techniques and future planning based on the sustainability of healthcare systems to cope with the outbreak 3 pragmatic understanding of the novel pathogen sars-cov-2 revealed an essential genetic sequencing similarity to the previously known pathogen sars 4 a mean incubation period of 52 days of sars-cov-2 has been reported to cause the onset of symptoms and a mean 125 days for hospitalization from day of infection 5 6 fauci et al emphasized the time interval during the incubation of sars-cov-2 to hold crucial information on pathogenesis and asserted the need to understand it to design an effective containment policy 7 current understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis focuses on the angiotensin converting enzyme 2ace2 based sars-cov-2 cell entry that infects lung epithelial cells and synergistic entry through endosome proteases cell prime entry that infects the host cell 8 novel coronavirus also infects t-lymphocytes 9 recent retrospective studies revealed that elders are more prone to covid-19 and were more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation with a high mortality among covid-19 infected patients and robust research revealed the clinical presentation of covid-19 currently covid-19 is detectable with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr which detects presence of genetic fragments of sars-cov-2 within secretions from nasal and pharyngeal epithelial mucus membrane employed techniques of rt-pcr and immunoglobulin presence detection methods have their own limitations of detection within a specific time period prior to detection through rt-pcr no method is available to assess covid-19 infection during incubation and after the onset of symptoms consequently a high transmission rate has been reported and needs to be reduced for effective containment 7 in this study we evaluated the current knowledge of covid-19 pathogenesis and its manifestation to formulate an easy method to detect and assess the covid-19 course of infection and to counter outbreaks by reducing transmission rates through early sensing and adopting appropriate measurescomparatively similar clinical features were previously reported to be caused by influenza influenza caused by h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 produced variable symptoms in humans median incubation periods are 2 days 16 days and 25 days respectively all strains cause acute symptoms variable in nature and intensity 1016 h1n1 causes a fever similar to h3n2 with a relatively shorter duration of 12 days while h3n2 causes a fever of 16 days avian influenza h5n1 presents with baffling symptoms aggressive in nature like inexplicable diarrhea or encephalopathy intensity of the symptoms is high and related with areas of known outbreaks fever temperature  38c is present in symptomatic patients with abdominal features including vomiting diarrhea myalgia or arthralgia rhinorrhea cough and sputum production all signs and symptoms appeared concomitantly on median 2 or 3 days after infection 10 h1n1 causes symptoms to appear on day 2 the virus is detectable during a median period of 26 days after infection sore throat nasal congestion nausea vomiting and myalgia are common symptoms with a mild to severe fever distinguishing signs are enlarged lymph nodes tonsillitis and throat congestion while prominent features are leukopenia lymphopenia and hypokalemia 11 12 h3n2 significantly reduced the weight of patients during the early days of infection 13 14 severe cases of h5n1 presents with cardiomyopathies ventricular tachycardia renal failure ventilation assisted viral pneumonia reyes syndrome and pneumothorax death occurred due to multi-organ failure blood biomarkers abruptly developed leukopenia lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and elevated aminotransferases 15 16clinical manifestations of sars-cov-2 appeared variable as compared to influenza symptoms of covid-19 also vary slightly from region to region abdominal symptoms were more frequent in the usa than china 1721 asymptomatic mild and severe symptoms were observed in various studies 2227 asymptomatic or milder cases did not seek medical intervention mild symptoms included a temperature 375c and dry cough initially and could develop to moderate symptomatic cases fever cough abdominal discomfort and deranged blood biomarkers were recorded in moderate cases severe cases presented with shortness of breath dyspnea and tachypnea and required mechanical ventilation 28 persistent cough fever and fatigue were associated symptoms of an underlying pathology or pre-existing pathology not restricted to cardiovascular issues hypertension liver compromise and diabetes blood po2 levels decreased blood biomarkers developed lymphopenia thrombopenia and elevated aminotransferases in moderate and severe cases white blood cells deteriorated in severe cases and required mechanical ventilation persistent fever and characteristic consistent coughinginitially dry for several days followed by a productive coughare the main features in patients with pre-existing respiratory infections a few symptoms were variable with geographical regions 2938 in the current study we emphasized the pathogenesis of covid-19 assessed through signs and symptoms and its manifestation to formulate a practicable approach to detect and assess covid-19s course of infection to counter outbreaks by reducing the transmission rate through early sensing and adopting appropriate measureswe used a retrospective approach to collect observational data about the most common presenting signs and symptoms in reported cases of covid-19 data was searched with the terms clinical presentation of covid-19 clinical features of covid-19 covid-19 reported cases clinical picture of covid-19 covid-19 symptoms through search engines like google scholar pubmed and science direct to obtain any available updated information about the clinical aspects and clinical presentation of covid-19data was assessed for common presentations made by collected publications for sensing essential common symptoms the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula was designed based on collected data that adhered to the most common and easily accessible symptoms which can affect an early diagnosis of covid-19 or due to their absence could delay diagnosis or cause misdiagnosis the important differentiating clinical features signs and symptoms were aligned in table form providing a sketch of the most common essential symptoms data about the frequency of symptoms in relation with covid-19 diagnosis were categorized into clinical features and blood biomarkers we categorized common symptoms and blood biomarkers for covid-19 extracted from the collected data and these were categorized into two groupsthe classification of normal to severe symptoms was determined from collected data containing values ratios with interquartile ranges and percentages of occurrence in observational studies four scoring tiers were formulated each sign and symptom were assigned a score by using the borg scale scoring method previously described by hommerding et al 39 with slight modifications signs and symptoms were given a score between 1 and 4 normal signs and symptoms were given a score of 1 and placed in the first tier mild presentation in signs and symptoms were given a score of 2 and placed in the second tier third tier includes moderately presenting symptoms given a score of 3 and severe cases were given a score of 4 in the fourth tier the highest score in the fourth tier scores 39 which represents severe disease while the lowest in the first tier scores 11 and showed normal or no disease mild disease scored between 13 and 22 and moderate disease scored between 23 and 33 variable scoring showed stages of the disease as mild moderate or severe minimum and maximum scores were calculated and evaluated for the available data collected and compiled in table 1 all data were calculated on the score chart to evaluate its efficacy for detecting early common signs and symptoms to make an easy decision on whether to hold isolation and other immediate measures surrounding the early confirmation of covid-19 the chart was given the name of the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula for calculating early common signs and symptoms of covid-19 for early detection and disease assessmentwe investigated the relationship of frequent appearances of common signs and symptoms with diagnosed covid-19 cases by pearson correlation and spearman correlation coefficient rho two-tail 38 cumulative frequencies of each common sign and symptom were assessed by chi-square test two tail with cramers v strength methods 40 highly significant symptoms and signs showing correlation were assessed by the linear regression method to establish ostensible correlation compiled data was analyzed statistically by using ibm spss version20twenty studies containing detailed information of 10172 covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases showed a common symptomatic correlation with covid-19 were statistically significant sig 0000 for each sign and symptom fever at 439 was significant 0000 cough at 5408 and dry mucus membrane at 2568 values were equally significant 0000 hyperemic mucus membrane at 1792 was significant with p  0005 leukopenia 2811 and lymphopenia 6435 showed a significance of 0000 thrombopenia 3549 showed a strong correlation sig0000 with covid-19 at significant p 001 amino transferases alt and ast 5002 and 3449 respectively showed a strong correlation and were statistically significant 0001 thereafter symptoms holding high sensitivity correlations star values with the development of covid-19 were extracted by linear regression model statistical data is shown in table 2 symptoms frequency appearance in covid-19 was assessed by chi-square method and results shown in table 2 fever and lymphopenia frequency showed a similar significance p  0000 cough showed a significance frequent appearance in covid-19 p  002 dry mucus membrane and thrombopenia showed a similar significance p  0006 hyperemic mucus membrane did not show a significant value p  0062 while aminotransferases showed an equal significance p  0001symptoms of covid-19 were classified into early symptoms and late symptoms based on severity early symptoms can be a point of consideration for getting early detection covid-19 diagnosis could be missed during the early stage because of early symptoms being mild in nature however distinct evaluations for covid-19 could be made by calculating scores of correlated blood biomarkers analysis through the hashmi-asif covid-19 chart as elaborated in chart 1 common signs and symptoms were classified according to severity including normal with no disease milder moderate and severe cases the formula contains a maximum of 39 1524 scores out of which cases with a cumulative scoring ranging from 132239 should be considered at high risk to be diagnosed with covid-19 isolated immediately and should be evaluated by standard diagnostic procedure rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 the formula provides an easy approach to screen the suspects and carriers of covid-19 34 days earlier than current procedures because oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs detected positive for sars-cov-2 by rt-pct after an average of 7 days of infection blood oxygen saturation does not change much at early stages and the reason was not included in the calculation formula oxygen saturation decreases during advanced stages of covid-19 and time can be saved by taking such early measures decreased o2 gas in the blood is signifies a critical situation that requires urgent interventionsscoring on the hashmi-asif covid-19 chart is based on the course of disease of covid-19 described in recent reports 17 18 the course of disease of covid-19 is divided into four stages by the authors first a healthy status scoring 12 on the chart is normal second a milder disease form holding some bodily response in blood bio-markers and slight changes occurring in the values of biomarker these changed responses include neutrophil based antiviral response lymphopcytes reduction because lymphocytes get infected by sars-cov-2 9 and slight changes in aminotransferases milder cases score between 13 and 22 on the hashmi-asif covid-19 chart moderate disease produced a sufficient response within the body to be measured through blood biomarkers and changes in biomarker values scored 2333 on the chart severe cases showed a full body response to viral attack and scored 3439early detection for covid-19 in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases showed its ability to isolate covid-19 cases at an early stage the calculation chart is provided with double calculation methods to enhance the sensitivity of the outcome the formula provides an easy approach to screen the suspects and carriers of covid-19 earlier than previously being diagnosed the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula expedites the ability of health care providers in developing countries lacking appropriate health facilities to diagnose covid-19 the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula based on the most common early presentations of the covid-19 and on changing response in signs and symptoms and blood biomarkers has made evaluating covid-19 easier by using the formula covid-19 can be diagnosed 7296 h earlier than it currently can it will provide ample time to adopt interventions for covid-19 and to reduce the mortality rate by early management the chart can be helpful to restrict transmission rates of sars-cov-2  1 consequently decreasing infection spread in contacts the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula expedites the ability of health care providers in developing countries lacking appropriate facilities to diagnose covid-19 the hashmi-asif covid-19 formula works via calculation of scores of the most common early presentations of covid-19 separate calculations of scoring for signs and symptoms and blood biomarkers made it appropriate for covid-19 detection and evaluation the chart also provides a tool to assess whether the status of covid-19 is either progressing or reducing toward a healthy situationour study has various limitations it is a retrospective study based on reported clinical manifestations and probable courses of disease from available data around the world individual data of patients of covid-19 were less reported and collective analyzed data was evaluated a prospective study is underway to evaluate the utilization of the hashmi-asif covid-19 assessment chart and its efficacy within domestic covid-19 patientsthe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding authorethical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements written informed consent for participation was not required for this study in accordance with the national legislation and the institutional requirementsall authors listed have made a substantial direct and intellectual contribution to the work and approved it for publicationthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe world health organization who characterized the covid-19 pandemic on 11th march 2020 1  the symptoms of covid-19 induced by the novel pathogen sars-cov-2 are difficult to differentiate from other common infections in a large proportion of those infected it is estimated that about 40 of cases will experience mild disease cough fever 40 experience moderate disease bilateral pneumonia 15 develop severe disease and 5 will have critical disease 2 a recommendation by the who has been to conduct early screening of patients to identify isolate and track those infected and prevent transmission 2reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr based methodologies have been the gold standard in confirming that the individual presenting with covid-19 has active viral shedding of sars-cov-2 3 4 however the ability to conduct wide scale testing of patients has been limited by a number of factors including suitable resources for rt-pcr based testing for the presence of sars-cov-2 in addition the standard test used has an 80 accuracy compared to chest ct scan results 5 which may depend on the specific level of viral shedding by any individual at the time of sample test moreover the time from sample collection to informing the patient is estimated to take many hours to several days according to the systems in place these complex issues hand in hand with the wide-ranging symptoms presenting in patients and the discrepant results between chest ct symptoms and rt-pcr results 5 indicates that testing for the direct presence of virus requires significant improvementwhile highly specific tests for sars-cov-2 are under development using crispr 6 and biosensors 7 8 these innovative applications will require highly specialised equipment and resources this will negatively affect less affluent areas that will be unable to access these technologies in the short time frame in order to contain the pandemic therefore there is a global challenge to enable screening without the need for sophisticated equipment and resourcesmachine learning and artificial intelligence approaches are rapidly being developed to aid clinical procedures in the current pandemic such as predicting the specificity of new therapies 9 and diagnosing covid 19 patients from radiographic patterns on ct scans 10in the current study we focused on predicting whether a person is sars-cov-2 positive or negative in the early stage of the disease the approach taken is based on the reported limitation to conduct rt- pcr tests and the need to quickly differentiate between individuals presenting with similar symptoms as seen between covid 19 and other common infections the dataset used here comes from a public challenge by mindstream-ai 11 to use artificial intelligence to predict the test result for sars-cov-2 positivenegative solely from complete blood teststhe hospital israelita albert einstein is located in the state of sao paulo brazil with a population of 12 million people had 477 confirmed cases of covid 19 and 30 associated deaths by the 23rd march 2020 the hospital publicly released full blood counts 12 from 598 anonymised patients along with the rt-pcr result for sars-cov-2 and their age quantile symptoms or patient history were not released here we present evidence that patients having sars-cov-2 can be identified by random forest machine learning and artificial neural networks ann to patients not admitted to hospital community and to patients in a regular ward setting through recognition of the altered immune cell profile these will allow for a rapid early screening purely based on the blood profileall data processed in this study is published on a public forum 12 as part of a challenge to accelerate approaches to combat the spread of sars-cov-2 this dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the hospital israelita albert einstein at so paulo brazil and who had samples collected to perform the sars-cov-2 rt-pcr and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital all data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations 11 all clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero

used for statistical analysis the remaining 5046 results were not used due to lack of full blood count datawithout in-depth data on the timeline of the tests performed in the duration of the infection analysis was performed on the basis of severity according to the location of the patient within the hospital system the blood counts are from four classifications of patients community patients not admitted to hospital regular ward semi intensive care and intensive care unit icu table 1
patients that are in semi-intensive and intensive care units are excluded from our modelling so as to ensure prediction is based on early indicators also neutrophils are not included since this is not reported for all 598 patients furthermore we exclude age from our modellingthere is a large imbalance of positive 8 vs negative 92 sars-cov-2 patients in the community  as a result it is more informative to test separately for the specificity -ge of negative patients correctly identified as negative and the sensitivity -ge of positive patients correctly identified as positive rather than solely the total accuracyof the 598 complete counts analysed 367 patients had also been tested for other pathogens adenovirus bordetella pertussis chlamydophila pneumoniae coronavirus 229e coronavirus hku1 coronavirus nl63 coronavirus oc43 inf a h1n1 2009 influenza a influenza b metapneumovirus parainfluenza 1 parainfluenza 2 parainfluenza 3 parainfluenza 4 respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus enterovirusfor our 2-class sars-cov-2 positive vs negative classification we employ several machine learning and artificial network modelsfor the machine learning models we apply random forest 14 15 16 and lasso-elastic-net regularized generalized linear glmnet models for classification random forest as a classifier is based on several decision trees to classify a new object each decision tree provides a classification for input data and the random forest uses the mode of those classification to decide on the classin this paper glmnet on the other hand fits a traditional logistic model but instead of using all the predictors it uses a regularized path to select the most important variables and only use them in the logistic regression for both these methods we present results for 10-fold cross-validation and their corresponding variable importance plots 17furthermore an artificial neural network ann 13 model is defined with 14 input parameters and three hidden layers and trained for 100 epochs the classification performance of the ann model is evaluated with stratified 10-fold cross validationthe performance of each model is expressed in terms of auc sensitivity specificity and accuracy they are defined as follows sensitivity is the fraction of the sars-cov-2 positive patients correctly identified specificity is the fraction of sars-cov-2 negative patients correctly identified as such accuracy is the total number of patients correctly identified by lowering the threshold of detecting sars-cov-2 positive patients the sensitivity can increase at the expense of specificity hence we also look at the commonly employed auc this is the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve the curve when plotting sensitivity vs 1-specificity upon changing the threshold the auc also known as the wilcoxon-mann-whitney statistic is the probability that a sars-cov-2 positive patient is higher ranked than a sars-cov-2 negative patient a higher auc generally implies a better performing model we note that the drawback of using accuracy alone is that in an unbalanced set of mainly sars-cov-2 negative patients as is the case in the community dataset the accuracy can be high using zero sensitivitysignificant differences p005 between 9 of the 15 blood count parameters were shown between patients in a regular ward setting who tested positive or negative to sars-cov-2 presence figure 1

a and b and a clear indication of how the decision has been obtained additionally glmnet does a variable selection by providing a much smaller stable set of variables among 14 highly correlated predictorsanalysis of the top four variables according to glmnet that corresponded to patients in community supplementary figure 1 and regular ward supplementary figure 2 indicated a clear recognisable pattern in particular to note in patients in the regular ward is in the decreased pool of leukocytes overall increase in red blood cells and in particular a significant decrease in eosinophils community patients having sars-cov-2 have distinctively high levels of monocytes and low levels of leukocytesin order to enable a rapid prediction model for clinics 12 where clinicians may want to choose only two figure 5
a three figure 5

c the monocytesleukocyteseosinophilsplatelets trends in supplementary figures 1 and 2 and figure 1 were analysed by adding monocytes and subtracting leukocytes eosinophils and platelets this difference indicates little overlap between patients who test positive and negative for sars-cov-2 however it must be noted that this is a simple additive formula based on normalised datafor example a simple logistic regression lr with derived variable ymonocytes - leukocytes - eosinophils - platelets shows this blood characteristic can predict the covid test outcome with an average auc  85 over 10 fold cross-validation among the patients in the community and auc  81 for patients in regular wardthe model predictions from ann random forest glmnet and the formula monocytes - leukocytes - eosinophils and m-l-e-p are summarized in table 2 and table 3

of the patients testing for sars-cov-2 and complete blood tests 366 patients were tested for other pathogens of which 188 patients were diagnosed with other infections to note rhinovirus and influenza b table 4
 collectively 51 tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus influenza a influenza b parainfluenza 1 coronavirus nl63 rhinovirus enterovirus coronavirus hku1 parainfluenza 3 chlamydophila pneumonia adenovirus parainfluenza 4 coronavirus 229e coronavirus oc43 influenza a h1n1 2009 bordetella pertussis metapneumovirus and parainfluenza 2 the similar presentation of many of these infections to covid19 may however be differentiated by the clear difference in immune response to sars-cov-2 using the ann model of full blood count analysisof the 598 patients only one tested positive for sars-cov-2 and for at least one other pathogen that patient also tested positive for influenza b and for coronavirus nl63 and was in icuin addition to the changing profile of immune cells a change in red blood cells and platelets were noted in order to describe the profile of cells the mean changes were plotted from patients in regular ward supplementary figure 3we developed multiple independent models statistical random forest and shallow learning that can predict sars-cov-2 with an auc of up to 86 for community and 94 for regular ward patients using only data collected from their normalized full blood counts this provides an initial screen of sars-cov-2 positive from negative using biomarkers at an early stage in the disease presentation this screen has been conducted on a set of data based on severity judged by the location of the patient in hospital admitted to the regular ward compared to not admitted to hospital icu patients were excluded hence the models are able to distinguish from altered blood profiles in patients who were later diagnosed with other pathogensit is well recognised that the symptoms of covid 19 are accompanied by a significant change in immune response 19 with a decreased population of leukocytes lymphocytes 20 21 and eosinophils 19 20 21 found throughout all stages of infection indeed it was suggested in one case report from wuhan that eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis 22 other early reports used similar predictive patterns found in full blood count parameters suggesting that elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio could be used as part of the diagnosis 23 in that study they investigated the change in blood parameters in a total of 93 patients severe and non severe collected together using commonly used ratios used in the diagnosis of viral respiratory diseases such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio derived nlr ratio d-nlr neutrophil count divided by the result of wbc count minus neutrophil count platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio however these parameters commonly alter in respect to other viral infections and we initiated research to identify new ratios to distinguish sars-cov-2 from other pathogenshere we show that a new simple calculation based on leukocytes monocytes eosinophils and platelets normalized monocytes - leukocytes - eosinophils - platelets can be used to predict with 85 auc the presence of sars-cov-2 for early-stage community patients further validation will be required to determine whether our model can distinguish fully from other pathogens although initial small numbers indicate a trend that is positiveleukocytes are a family of white blood cells that includes neutrophils lymphocytes monocytes eosinophils and basophils specific pathogens induce specific responses such as an increase in circulating neutrophils and monocytes typically increase during sepsis as part of the immune defence mechanism and several studies have indicated that ratios between different blood cells can be used to predict outcome the ratio of monocyte  neutrophil can be used to determine sepsis severity 24  and platelet  monocyte aggregation has been reported to be increased in patients with influenza a h1n1 25 indeed the clinical interest in using the relationship between different parameters of the full blood count is of great value and interest due to its simplicity and readily measurable parameters while not yet in common clinical use it has been shown that neutrophil  lymphocyte and mean platelet volume  platelet count could predict the outcome for critically ill patients with peritonitis and pancreatitis bacteremia 26 our results presented here clearly demonstrates that an early prediction of those infected with sars-cov-2 may be made by the relationship between monocytes eosinophils and leukocytes to differentiate them from other pathogen induced infectionsthe data analysed in this report focussed on the clear early stages in order to differentiate between patients presenting with common symptoms prior to the need to be in icu the changes in parameters of the full blood count is easily distinguishable from other pathogen-induced infections with an apparent decrease in leukocyte population consisting of a large proportion of monocytes this observation is in keeping with other tools used to diagnose the severity of covid 19 by the measurement of il6 which significantly increases throughout the progression of disease the cytokine il6 is predominantly synthesised by monocytes and macrophage which derive from monocytes and is partly responsible for the drive of the immune response to deleterious cytokine stormin order to best understand the immune response to sars-cov-2 it is useful to compare it to other similar coronaviruses there are two main example closest known example is that of sars-cov virus sars which infected 8096 people and killed 774 in 2002- 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov which in 2013 infected 2102 people and killed 780 the majority of all other coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in contrast the highly infectious and highly pathogenic coronaviruses sars and mers were noted to have similar effects on the immune response and more recently overlaps with the pathogenesis now witnessed with sars-cov-2 infections the sars virus directly infects human monocytes which then produces the cytokines that attract neutrophils macrophage and activated t lymphocytes 27 mers was shown to increase monocytes and their il6 production 28 in parallel this study indicates that the pathogenesis to sars-cov-2 may be linked to monocytes and the production of il6 here in our study the analysis of monocyte involvement will be crucial in the prediction of sars-cov-2 infection additionally use of ai and ml to recognise the altered pattern of key blood parameters will be a useful tool in future with the emergence of any future coronavirus that is equally pathogenic and contagiousthe decrease in platelets in patients testing positive for sars-cov-2 in the regular ward is opposite to that observed in separate reports of patients with influenza a 29 a subset of the patients included in this analysis were tested for other pathogens and a proportion of those negative for sars-cov-2 were positive for other pathogens including coronaviruses nl63 hku1 and 229e and few had influenza a or b this suggests that platelet count is a good indicator in this predictive model and may be a good way to differentiate sars-cov-2 infection from influenza athe suggests a potential decreased platelet presence in patients which is of concern due to its link to thrombocytopenia and increased internal bleeding this supports other reports of an increase in thrombocytopenia being associated with higher mortality in covid 19 patients 21 the condition of thrombocytopenia may be the reason for the recently noted rashes observed in patients especially young children 30 however there have been reports that clotting is increased in covid 19 patients and the data we show is normalised and may be misleading this normalised data also indicates an increase in platelet size mpv which suggests that there is rapid platelet production by the bone marrow indeed it is recommended that covid 19 patients are administered antiplatelet therapy to protect against thrombosis 31 overall this highlights the difficulty of interpreting mean normalised datathis report is the first to use primary patient data of full blood counts to test and train an ann to predict from patients in a regular ward as well as those in the community who will test positive for sars-cov2 this preliminary model will be further trained and adapted with the aim to address the shortfall in direct sars-cov-2 testing methods in hospitals this will enable a prediction that allows health care providers to conduct rapid cheap screening to separate patients into those who are most likely to have sars-cov-2 and those who do not early screening allows segregation of patients and early treatment interventionfundingthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorssevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is caused by the sars-cov reports of the emergence of sars-cov appeared in february 2003 with the first cases observed in guangdong province in china the virus spread to nearly 30 countries throughout the world resulting in more than 8000 cases and 770 deaths8
the outbreak was brought under control after public health control measures to reduce contact with infected persons were put into place and no cases have been seen since 2004 manifestations of sars consist of fever chills headache malaise and myalgia diarrhea was seen in some patients pneumonia was nearly always seen in patients diagnosed with sars with mechanical ventilation being required in 1020 of cases case fatality rate was estimated at 910 table
the natural reservoir for sars-cov is believed to be bats however some evidence supported civet cats or raccoon dogs as possible intermediate sources of these illnesses8 sars is transmitted by close person-to-person contact through contact of the mucus membranes of the respiratory tract with respiratory droplets formed when an infected person coughs or sneezes fecal-oral transmission and transmission via fomites have also been reported8 airborne spread because of inhalation of small particle aerosols may also be possibletransmission in health care settings was frequently seen during the 2003 outbreak with superspreading when a single patient transmits infection to a disproportionate number of contacts reported9 the incubation period was estimated at a mean of 46 days with a range of 214 days transmission appeared to occur most often during the second week of illness when viral excretion is highest there is no evidence that a person with sars is contagious before symptom onsetthe largest case series of pregnant women with sars was from the 2003 outbreak in hong kong in which 12 pregnant women were identified10 the case-fatality rate was 25 3 deaths clinical and laboratory findings were similar to those seen in the nonpregnant population pneumonia on chest radiograph or computed tomography was seen in all patients major medical complications included adult respiratory distress syndrome in 4 disseminated intravascular coagulopathy dic in 3 renal failure in 3 secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2 and sepsis in 2 patientspregnancy outcomes varied by trimester of presentation10 among the 7 women who became ill in the first trimester 4 had a spontaneous abortion 2 had pregnancy terminations for social reasons after recovery from sars and 1 delivered a full-term healthy infant among the 5 women who presented after 24 weeks gestation 4 delivered preterm three women delivered by cesarean delivery because of deteriorating maternal condition from their sars illness at 26 28 and 32 weeks gestation11 these babies had birthweights appropriate for gestational age two of the infants had respiratory distress syndrome requiring surfactant born at 26 and 28 weeks gestation with one later developing bronchopulmonary dysplasiagastrointestinal complications were observed in 2 infants including a jejunal perforation in an infant delivered at 26 weeks and necrotizing enterocolitis with ileal perforation in an infant delivered at 28 weeks gestation whether these gastrointestinal complications were related to complications from sars or its treatment or whether they were secondary to preterm delivery is unknown11 the two infants who were delivered after their mothers recovery from sars had intrauterine growth restriction no clinical radiologic or laboratory evidence for transmission from mother to fetus was observed despite laboratory testing of different specimens12

a matched case-control study14 compared 10 of the 12 pregnant women noted in the previous text 2 were excluded because they were unable to be matched with 40 nonpregnant women with sars women were matched on sex age timing of contracting sars health care worker status underlying illness and whether the woman resided in a housing area in which there was a large outbreakpregnancy appeared to have no effect on clinical symptoms or time to presentation after symptom onset however complications and adverse outcomes were more common among pregnant women women who were pregnant had a longer hospital stay were statistically significantly more likely to develop renal failure sepsis and dic and were more likely to require intensive care unit admission forty percent of pregnant women required mechanical ventilation compared with 13 of nonpregnant patients p  07 pregnant women were also significantly more likely to die p  01we identified 5 reports of additional cases of sars during pregnancy treated in hong kong n  2 the united states n  2 and canada n  115 16 17 18 19 two of the 5 women required mechanical ventilation 1 required hemodialysis for acute renal failure and 1 had seizures and positive cerebrospinal fluid for sars-cov suggestive of a central nervous system infection all patients recovered from their illness in 1 case the pregnancy was terminated at the mothers request the remaining pregnancies ended in liveborn infants 2 at term and 2 preterm testing of neonatal specimens for sars-cov rna was negativeseveral hospitals in toronto and hong kong reported measures instituted on obstetrics services during the sars outbreak to decrease transmission to pregnant women their families community members and health care workers20

21 for example all hospital staff patients and visitors were screened for symptoms at the hospital entrance and wore n95 respirators visitors were limited to 1 per patient on labor and delivery with no visitors allowed in the postpartum wardpostpartum stays were reduced in length with a postpartum nurse home visit added postpartum patients were asked to observe a 10 day home quarantine health care workers were asked to observe a work quarantine in which they were asked to go directly from home to work and vice versa to minimize interaction in the community obstetric services considered to be nonessential such as routine ultrasound and prenatal diagnosis were suspended although the impact of these interventions was not evaluated there may be some relevant lessons learned from these experiences during sars that could help inform the approach to covid-19middle east respiratory syndrome mers is a respiratory illness caused by mers-cov the illness was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 with spread to other countries in the arabian peninsula and eventually to countries outside the arabian peninsula including the united states22

23 the largest outbreak outside the arabian peninsula was in the republic of korea in 2015nearly 2500 cases of mers-cov illness and more than 860 deaths have been reported with continuing reports into the present the manifestations of mers include severe respiratory illness characterized by fever cough and shortness of breath some patients also have diarrhea the case fatality rate is estimated to be 3540patients who developed mers were more likely to be older median age is 50 years with about two thirds of patients being male patients with mers were also more likely to have an underlying illness some patients with mers-cov infection have been asymptomatic identified through contact investigationsthe mean incubation period is 52 days with a range of 213 days as with sars mers is mainly spread person to person through close contact with transmission in health care settings and superspreading events have been observed however since 2016 the number of cases of mers-cov has been dramatically reduced after public health efforts to prevent mers-cov transmission were put into place24
information on mers among pregnant women is limited we identified reports of 13 cases of pregnant women with mers from several countries including saudi arabia n  8 korea n  2 jordan n  1 united arab emirates n  1 and philippines n  113

25 26 27 28 29 30 31 two women were asymptomatic identified as part of a contact investigation among the 11 symptomatic women manifestations were similar to those seen in nonpregnant patients with mersseven of 13 patients were admitted to an intensive care unit for respiratory deterioration or acute respiratory distress syndrome 5 required ventilator support 3 died and 8 recovered among the 3 deaths the mothers died 825 days after delivery both babies born to asymptomatic women were born healthy at term among those who were symptomatic there was 1 intrauterine fetal demise 1 stillbirth 1 baby delivered at 25 weeks who died 4 hours after birth 2 healthy preterm infants and 5 healthy term infants infant status was not mentioned for 1respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus now referred to as sars-cov-2 was first noted in december 2019 in wuhan hubei province china the who china country office was notified of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology on dec 31 2019 figure 2 between dec 31 2019 and jan 3 2020 44 cases were reported to the who on jan 7 2020 chinese authorities identified a novel coronavirus as the cause the virus has quickly spread first through wuhan and subsequently to other areas of china and other countries in the world figure 1early data suggested an association between the huanan seafood wholesale market and covid-19 with 27 of 41 cases in 1 report32 and 26 of 47 in another report33 with epidemiologic links to the market leading to closure of the market on jan 1 2020 given that the earliest case reported illness onset on dec 1 201932 did not have exposure to the market raises the possibility that the initial emergence into humans occurred elsewhere however sampling of the markets environment supports the markets importance in early transmission of the virus later cases were much less likely to have visited the market supporting the role of person-to-person transmission in later casesthe sars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus similar to sars-cov and mers-cov table sequencing data show that the sars-cov-2 is most closely related to coronaviruses found in bats with more than 85 nucleotide identity with a bat sars-like cov34

35 the virus has 79 nucleotide identity to sars-cov and about 50 to mers-cov35
bats appear to be the natural reservoirs of both sars-cov and mers-cov the emergence of these viruses in humans has been attributed to host switching the virus jumped from an intermediary host species eg civet cats for sars-cov and dromedary camels for mers-cov to humans an intermediary host species is thought to be likely for sars-cov-235 although it has been yet to be identified sequence data show a high degree 9998 of similarity of the virus among different patients suggesting a recent emergence in humansclinical manifestations of covid-19 are similar to those with sars and mers table studies of hospitalized patients with covid-19 show that patients commonly develop severe pneumonia with 2332 admitted to the intensive care unit and 1729 of cases progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome 32

37 overall case fatality ratio estimates including asymptomatic and symptomatic infections appear to be in the range of 1 95 confidence interval 05438 although these estimates should be considered preliminaryaverage age of hospitalized patients was 4956 years with 3251 having an underlying illness most patients 5473 were men children with covid-19 appear to be rarely identified with only 28 children reported as of jan 30 2020 1 of total and most of those identified had mild symptoms39 no pregnant women were reported in any of these initial cohorts common manifestations among hospitalized patients were fever 83100 cough 5982 myalgia 1135 headache 78 and diarrhea 210 all patients had abnormalities on radiographic imaging of the chestperson-to-person transmission of sars-cov-2 is thought to be similar to transmission of influenza and other respiratory pathogens respiratory droplets are formed when an infected person coughs or sneezes and these droplets are inhaled by close contacts generally within 6 feet it is unclear whether infection can be transmitted from fomites fecal-oral transmission might be possible given that sars-cov-2 has been identified in stool specimens40 and sars-cov might have been transmitted in this manner41
the basic reproduction number r0 the average number of people who will become infected from a single infected person in a population in which all persons are susceptible is affected by factors such as the duration of infectivity the transmissibility of the pathogen and the number of susceptible contacts measles which is highly infective has an r0 of 1218 while 2009 h1n1 influenza and sars have an r0 of 1216 and 25 respectively42 current estimates of r0 for sars-cov-2 places it at 22 95 confidence interval 143933 as with sars and mers nosocomial transmission is playing a key role in transmission presumed to be responsible for infection of 29 of affected health professionals and 12 of hospitalized patients in a recent study37
although data are limited there is no evidence from other severe coronavirus infections sars or mers that pregnant women are more susceptible to infection with coronavirus thus far in this outbreak of novel coronavirus infection more men have been affected than women32

33

36

37 this observed gender difference could be due to differences in reporting susceptibility exposure or recognition and diagnosis of infection there are no data to inform whether pregnancy increases susceptibility to covid-19previous data on sars and mers suggest that clinical findings during pregnancy can range from no symptoms to severe disease and death the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever and cough with more than 80 of hospitalized patients presenting with these symptoms36
in a recent study by chen et al44 9 women diagnosed with covid-19 during the third trimester of pregnancy were reported in this small series clinical presentation was similar to that seen in nonpregnant adults with fever in 7 cough in 4 myalgia in 3 and sore throat and malaise each in 2 women five had lymphopenia all had pneumonia but none required mechanical ventilation and none died all women had a cesarean delivery and apgar scores were 89 at 1 minute and 910 at 5 minutesin a second series of 9 pregnancies with 10 infants 1 set of twins reported by zhu et al45 symptom onset was before delivery 16 days in 4 on the day of delivery in 2 and after delivery 13 days in 3 cases clinical presentation of covid-19 was similar to that seen in nonpregnant patients among the 9 pregnancies intrauterine fetal distress was noted in 6 7 were cesarean deliveries and 6 infants were born preterm based on these limited reports and the available data from other respiratory pathogens such as sars and influenza it is unknown whether pregnant women with covid-19 will experience more severe diseasetravel recommendations have been instituted to limit exposure to persons in the united states all persons including pregnant women should not travel to china on feb 2 2020 the us state department upgraded their travel advisory to level 4 the highest level of travel advisory obstetric providers should obtain a detailed travel history for all patients and should specifically ask about travel in the past 14 days to areas experiencing widespread transmission of sars-cov-2 currently this is limited to china but this situation is rapidly evolving and obstetricians should stay alert to the global situation by consulting the centers for disease control and prevention website and following media coveragethere is currently no vaccine to prevent covid-19 since posting of a sars-cov-2 virus genetic sequence online on jan 10 2020 multiple organizations including the national institutes of health have been working to rapidly develop a covid-19 vaccine development of this vaccine builds on and benefits from work on sars and mers vaccines46 however it is not known how quickly a safe and effective vaccine may be readily availableall patients including pregnant women should be evaluated for fever and signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection ideally screening procedures begin before arrival on a labor and delivery unit or prenatal care clinic for example when scheduling appointments patients should be instructed what to do if they have respiratory symptoms on the day of their appointment or if a patient calls triage prior to presentation respiratory signs and symptoms should be assessed over the telephonethose patients with respiratory symptoms should be separated from other waiting patients and a facemask should be placed on them patients who meet criteria for a person under investigation box 1
 should be immediately placed in an airborne infection isolation room single-patient rooms at negative pressure once in isolation the patients facemask may be removed health care personnel should adhere to standard contact and airborne precautions infection control personnel and localstate health departments should be notified immediately localstate health departments can help to arrange testing of relevant specimens upper and lower respiratory specimens and serum are currently recommended other specimens stool and urine may also be sent

general principles regarding management of covid-10 during pregnancy include early isolation aggressive infection control procedures testing for sars-cov-2 and coinfection oxygen therapy as needed avoidance of fluid overload empiric antibiotics because of secondary bacterial infection risk fetal and uterine contraction monitoring early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure individualized delivery planning and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations box 2


team-based management is recommended for pregnancies managed in a health care facility and should include a determination of the optimal clinical unit on which to provide care ability to provide surveillance for early detection of a worsening maternal course of illness as well as an ability to monitor for evidence of obstetric complications eg preterm labor or fetal compromise are neededchanges in fetal heart rate pattern may be an early indicator of maternal respiratory deterioration based on experience with sars and mers severe respiratory failure might occur in pregnant women and in the most severe cases mechanical ventilation might not be sufficient to support adequate oxygenation if that occurs limited literature suggests a potential role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in pregnancy use should be considered only in centers that have experience with this technique47 whether delivery provides benefit to a critically ill mother is unknown decisions regarding delivery should consider the gestational age of the fetus and should be made in conjunction with the neonatologist48
there are currently no antiviral medications approved by the us food and drug administration for treatment of covid-19 although broad-spectrum antivirals used in animal models of mers are being evaluated for activity against sars-cov-246 corticosteroids for the treatment of coronavirus-associated pneumonia should be avoided unless other indications are present because they were not shown to be beneficial in mers and could lead to delayed mers-cov clearance49 therefore decisions about the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity should be made in consultation with infectious disease specialists and maternal-fetal medicine consultants all guidance should be considered subject to revision as additional data on pregnant women with covid-19 become availablealthough the limited experience with newborn evaluations after delivery with sars and mers has not identified cases of maternal-to-fetal transmission reports have appeared in the media of a 30 hour infant who was diagnosed with covid-19 suggesting the possibility of in utero transmission50 however insufficient information is included in media reports to rule out perinatal or postnatal modes of transmissiondata from the recent case series published by chen et al44 and zhu et al45 of 18 women 19 infants infected in the third trimester of pregnancy with sars-cov-2 identified no laboratory evidence of vertical transmission testing of amniotic fluid cord blood and neonatal throat swab samples was negative for sars-cov-2 in the 6 patients reported by chen et al44
in the report by zhu et al45 some infants were symptomatic shortness of breath in 6 cyanosis in 3 gastric bleeding in 2 and 1 baby died of multiple organ failure and dic however throat swab testing of all infants was negative for sars-cov-2  suggesting that these neonatal complications might not be related intrauterine transmission thus at this time it is unknown whether sars-cov-2 can be transmitted from mother-to-fetusgiven the current lack of information it seems reasonable to assume that a newborn born to a mother with covid-19 at delivery could possibly be infected either in utero or perinatally and thus should be placed in isolation to avoid exposure to other newborns although the ideal setting for a healthy infant is within a healthy mothers room temporary separation of an ill mother and her infant as was recommended during pandemic h1n151 seems prudentwhether covid-19 can be transmitted through breastmilk is unknown we are aware of a single report of sars-cov testing of breastmilk in a mother who had recovered from sars and no viral rna was detected however the specimen was collected 130 days after illness onset15 sars-cov antibodies were seen in breastmilk of that patient15 but not in another patient who was infected at 7 weeks gestation with breastmilk tested at postpartum days 12 and 3016 breastmilk was tested for sars-cov-2 in 6 of the mothers reported by chen et al44 all specimens were negativeuntil additional data are available mothers who intend to breastfeed and are well enough to express breastmilk should be encouraged to do so breastfeeding can be instituted after she is no longer considered infectious no data are available to guide length of separation and will need to be decided on a case-by-case basis after discussion between infection control experts and neonatologiststhe covid-19 outbreak is rapidly increasing in the number of cases deaths and countries affected much is unknown about the virus and its effects including its modes of transmission the basic reproduction number risk factors for illness and case fatality rate although cases are primarily in china it is highly likely that there will be additional global spread of the virusat the present time limited data are available on pregnant women with covid-19 on which to base recommendations for pregnancy-specific care however early reports and lessons from sars mers and other respiratory infections suggest that pregnant women could have a severe clinical course surveillance systems for cases of covid-19 need to include information on pregnancy status as well as maternal and fetal outcomesit is important to be vigilant about the spread of the disease and be able to provide rapid implementation of outbreak control and management measures once the virus reaches a community standard interventions to manage any severe respiratory infection is the foundation of care for any pregnant woman with covid-19 and should be implemented aggressively in a team-based care modelcoronavirus is a zoonotic virus an rna virus in the family coronaviridae of the order nidovirales1 it is a family of viruses that cause respiratory infections which were first isolated in 1937 and designated coronaviruses because they have a crown-like appearance under microscopy in 19652 the types of coronavirus known to date are as follows the alpha coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 the beta coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 sars-cov which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars mers-cov which causes middle east respiratory syndrome mers and sars-cov-2 a new coronavirus described in late 2019 after cases were reported in china2 which causes the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19the definitive diagnosis of covid-19 is made by analyzing respiratory samples collected by aspiration of the airways or sputum induction laboratory tests to identify the virus involve the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques and partial or total sequencing of the viral genome the collection of nasopharyngeal aspirate combined nasal and oral swab samples or samples of lower respiratory tract secretions sputum tracheal lavage fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is recommended to confirm the disease it is necessary to perform molecular biology tests that detect viral rna severe cases should be transferred to a referral hospital for isolation and treatment individuals with mild symptoms should be followed at the primary health care level and should be advised to selfisolate at home1the clinical spectrum of coronavirus infection is quite broad ranging from a simple cold to severe pneumonia clinically covid-19 initially presents as a flu-like syndrome individuals with covid-19 usually develop signs and symptoms such as mild respiratory illness and persistent fever an average of 5-6 days after infection range 1-14 days the fever is persistent in contrast with the progressive decline observed in cases of influenza13 fever may not be present in some cases such as those occurring in patients that are very young elderly or immunocompromised as well as in those that have used antipyretic medication1 in children the disease appears to be relatively rare and mild only approximately 24 of all reported cases occurring in individuals under 19 years of age of whom only 25 and 02 have developed severe or critical illness respectively13according to the clinical management protocol for the new coronavirus disseminated by the brazilian national ministry of health in february of this year1 males and individuals over 50 years of age predominated among the first 99 patients hospitalized with pneumonia and a confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 at a hospital in the city of wuhan among those 99 patients the main symptoms were fever in 83 cough in 82 shortness of breath in 31 muscle pain in 11 mental confusion in 9 headache in 8 sore throat in 5 rhinorrhea in 4 chest pain in 2 diarrhea in 2 and nauseavomiting in 1 in another study involving 41 patients diagnosed with covid-19 lymphopenia was reportedevaluating data from 1099 patients with confirmed covid-19 in china guan et al4 observed that the mean age of the patients was 47 years and that 419 of the patients were female the primary composite outcome-defined as admission to the intensive care unit icu the need for artificial ventilation or progression to death-occurred in 67 patients 61 admission to the icu occurring in 50 invasive mechanical ventilation being required in 23 and death occurring in 14 the most common symptoms were fever in 438 at admission and 887 during hospitalization and cough in 678 diarrhea occurred in only 38 of cases lymphopenia was present in 832 of patients on admission the mean incubation period was 4

the first 24-48 h and 61 had critical disease which includes respiratory failure and septic shock with or without multiple organ dysfunctionfailure although asymptomatic infection has been reported the proportion of truly asymptomatic cases is not well defined the individuals most at risk of serious illness and death reportedly include people over 60 years of age especially those with underlying conditions such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic respiratory disease and cancer13in patients with covid-19 the ct findings most commonly reported are ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation sometimes with a rounded morphology and peripheral distribution bernheim et al5 evaluated pulmonary abnormalities related to the duration of the disease and reported that on chest ct the disease was most extensive at approximately 10 days after symptom onset a chest x-ray is often essential for the evaluation of patients with suspected covid-19 immediate recognition of the disease is essential to ensure timely treatment from a public health point of view rapid isolation of the patient is crucial to containing this communicable diseasein the bernheim et al study5 the chest ct findings of 121 patients infected with covid-19 in china were characterized in relation to the time from the onset of symptoms to the first ct scan the authors hypothesized that the frequency of certain ct findings would increase in parallel with an increase in the time elapsed since infection only the initial chest ct scans were evaluated in 27 22 of the 121 patients ct showed no changes the remaining 94 78 patients had ground-glass opacities areas of consolidation or both of the 121 patients 73 60 had bilateral lung disease none of the 121 patients had thoracic lymph node disease pulmonary cavitation or pulmonary nodules and only 1 patient 1 had pleural effusion the time from the onset of symptoms to the first ct scan was classified as early 0-2 days 36 patients intermediate 3-5 days 33 patients or late 6-12 days 25 patients the frequency of ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation was considerably lower in the early-ct group than in the intermediate-ct group and late-ct group pulmonary opacities were seen in only 16 44 of the 36 early-ct group patients compared with 30 91 of the 33 intermediate-ct group patients and 24 96 of the 25 late-ct group patients bilateral pulmonary involvement was observed in 10 28 of the early-ct group patients in 25 76 of the intermediate-ct group patients and in 22 88 of the late-ct group patients linear opacities a crazy-paving pattern and the inverted halo sign were absent in the early-ct group but were present in the late-ct group in 5 20 5 20 and 1 4 of patients respectively in terms of disease distribution in the axial plane peripheral distribution was observed in 8 22 of the early-ct group patients in 21 64 of the intermediate-ct group patients and in 18 72 of the late-ct group patientsthe recognition of imaging patterns based on the time since coronavirus infection is critical not only to understanding the pathophysiology and natural history of the infection but also to predicting patient progression and the development of complications so far the anatomopathological aspects of the disease have not been described6 future studies will be able to evaluate imaging findings in patients with chronic covid-195 as well as to report the pathological aspects of the infectiondata of covid-19 death cases in hubei were extracted prospectively from the website of health commission of hubei province 18 and the official weibo chinas equivalent of twitter account of china central television news center 19 starting from 9 january 2020 when the first deceased patient was reported through 24 january 2020 when the 38th was registered since 25 january 2020 the number of death cases has been surging and the health commission of hubei province has stopped making public the information of death cases therefore data collection was terminated at that pointmicrosoft excel 2016 microsoft redmond wa usa and spss 230 software ibm corp armonk il usa was used for data analysis the death cases were described from four aspects gender and age characteristics underlying diseases death time distribution and symptoms at the incipience of illness and hospital admission frequencies  and median interquartile ranges iqr were used to describe the dataas of 24 january 2020 the overall case fatality rate for covid-19 was 53 in hubei among the fatalities there were 27 males and 11 females with a male to female ratio of 2451 the youngest age was 36 years and the oldest age was 89 years with the median age being 70 years iqr  65-81 the median age for females and males both stood at 70 though iqr ranged from 66 to 80 for the former and from 65 to 81 for the latter respectively distribution of 38 fatalities by genders and age groups was shown in figure 1 there were 14 cases aged 66-75 years making up the largest share of 3684 coming next was 10 cases aged 76-85 accounting for 2631 the same pattern was found for genders with 66-75 years forming the largest share of 3333 in males vs 4546 in females alone and 76-85 years the second largest 2222 in males vs 3636 in females aloneamong the death cases 25 had underlying diseases including 16 males and nine females accounting for 6578 of the total there were 15 cases of hypertension 11 cases of diabetes four cases of coronary heart disease three cases of chronic bronchitis two cases of cerebral infarction and two cases of parkinson disease other diseases included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tuberculosis frequent ventricular premature beats colon cancer gallstone cirrhosis chronic renal insufficiency fracture hip replacement etc all keeping a tally of one case respectively table 1 among all the death cases 17 had one or two underlying diseases and eight had more than three underlying diseasesamong the 38 fatalities the first case died on 9 january and the last in the batch died on 24 january 2020 with the period stretching 15 days during which the death toll didnt show apparent regularityto understand the evolution of death we defined the first symptom day fell on the date on which the patients started to feel their symptoms we described the period between the first symptom day and the death date as days from the first symptom to death and the period between the date of admission and death as days from admission to deaththe median time from the first symptom to death was 1250 days iqr  1000-1625 as for male dead patients the median time from the first symptom to death was 1300 days iqr  1100-1700 and for the females the median time from the first symptom to death was 1100 days iqr  900-1400the median time from admission to death was 850 days iqr  500-1200 as for male dead patients the median time from admission to death was 900 days iqr  500-1300 and for the females the median time from admission to death was 700 days iqr  500-1100days from the first symptom to death tailed off over the age groups of 56-65 66-75 75-85 and 85 while the days from admission to death had a similar pattern over the age groups of 56-65 66-75 75-85 but rebounded in persons aged over 85 figure 2 66 of the cases died within nine to 15 days since they felt the first symptomsfever and cough were the main reported symptoms at the onset of illness among the 38 early death cases twenty patients first complained of a fever 12 of coughs 9 of dyspnea 6 of chest tightness 6 of myalgia and fatigue accounting for 5263 3158 2368 1579 and 1579 respectively other symptoms included headache dizziness chills and intermittent diarrhea each keeping a tally of one casefever and dyspnea were the main reported symptoms at hospital admission among the 38 early death cases twenty-five patients complained of a fever 23 of dyspnea 16 of coughs 10 of chest tightness and 6 had the complaints of myalgia and fatigue accounting for 6579 6053 4211 2632 and 1579 respectively other symptoms are shown in table 27105 of the deaths were male considerably more than female which is consistent with the findings of wang w et al 21 single-cell sequencing of covid-19 virus receptors at tongji university found that asian men were more likely to be infected with covid-19 virus 22 and a study of 8866 cases nationwide also found that the death rate of men was more than three times that of women 23 the reason that male dominated the fatalities could be explained by the fact that percentage of ace2 level in men is higher than in women 23 rendering men more susceptible to covid-19 virusin addition covid-19 virus-infected people tend to be older ones 24 in a recent lancet article 15 february 2020 6 53 of the confirmed cases had chronic underlying diseases and the median age was 555 years indicating that the middle and old aged patients with chronic underlying diseases were more likely to contract the covid-19 virusfrom experience we can see that patients with chronic underlying diseases are indeed more likely to have disease deterioration or even death among the death cases persons with underlying diseases and aged over 65 made up of the majority hence we developed a speculation that covid-19 could worsen in elderly persons with underlying diseases and even more easily progress to death this is mainly due to the dwindling immunity in the elderly especially in those with underlying diseases which directly renders senior people more likely to be in a state of frailty and more vulnerable to infections 25 and subsequently leads to worsening of the disease 26among the death cases persons with hypertension and or diabetes made up the largest share which could be explained by the fact that hypertension and diabetes top the chronic disease chart in china 27 ace2 is a crucial regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and plays a regulatory role in the central regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function and could become an attractive target for the treatment of hypertension 2829 covid-19 virus uses the receptor ace2 to enter into target cells 30 precisely the same as sars-cov turner et al 31 found that sars-cov infection affects the function of ace2 so we speculate that the covid-19 virus will also impair the function of ace2 and then manipulate the regulation of blood pressure and have a negative impact on patients with hypertension on the other hand hypertension can cause vascular damage in patients with hypertension increased vascular stiffness and decreased elasticity are common followed by vascular remodeling and stenosis 32 the pathological results of patients with covid-19 showed that pulmonary vessels endothelial swelling luminal stenosis and occlusion leading to acute lung dysfunction 31 the coexistence of hypertension and covid-19 is a very unfavorable factor to induce lung dysfunction which is prone to aggravate the condition and even result in death ace2 gene can also be expressed in the pancreatic islets a study showed that the binding of sars-cov to ace2 damages islets and causes acute diabetes 33 covid-19 virus may also exert such a negative effect on islets through the same mechanism in persons with preexisting diabetes the damage of islets by covid-19 virus could be more severe and even fatal 43435 in addition ace2 is rich in the lungs heart kidney intestine and testicles etc once covid-19 virus gains entry into the human body more organs could be attacked by the virus through blood circulation over time 36 therefore early diagnosis of covid-19 before it progresses into severe conditions is an important measure for older people who have developed a fever and respiratory symptoms 24 other measures including reducing chances of exposure to infected cases eg banning visits to nursing home residents avoiding gatherings early isolation and treatment of symptomatic confirmed cases can be beneficial to the elderly population especially those with preexisting underlying diseasesin this study the number of deaths did not show obvious regularity with time within two weeks in addition the covid-19 virus infection rate has been spiking up since 20 january according to the data of the national health and health commission 37 and the results from our study we make the following speculation the cases gradually became infected around the end of december according to a median 7-day incubation period and a median 125-day period from the first symptom to death 20 if we take the later reported maximum incubation period of 38 days into account 38 a considerable part of them may have been infected in november besides the difference in immune resistance between different genders and ages is also an important reason for the irregular distribution of the time of death 39however from figure 2 it can be concluded that with the increase of age the days from hospital admission to death and the days from the first symptom to death gradually reduced indeed which shows that covid-19 poses a great threat to elderly patients 40 our study also shows that the days from hospital admission to death rebounded in persons aged over 85 years since there were only 4 cases aged over 85 years the finding needs further validation from long-term large-scale cohort studiesstudies have indicated that viral infection in the early stage mainly shows upper respiratory tract infection manifested as fever headache and cough 41 huang et al found a similar result that 98 of the patients with covid-19 experienced fever 76 had a cough and 55 had dyspnea as the first symptom respectively 42 however among the deaths up to 24 january 5263 had a fever 3158 had a cough and 2368 had dyspnea as the first symptom it can be seen that not all infected cases have high body temperature as the first symptom and the temperature change of old people is not very significant compared with young ones even when they have infectious diseases 43 among the severely infected elderly 20  30 of them have no fever or slow response to fever which is often a sign of poor prognosis 44 and hinders early detection of infection and brings more potential risks to the elderly therefore the early repeated examination is a valid response 45 however symptoms changed at the time of admission with 6579 of patients showing fever 6053 dyspnea 4211 cough indicating dyspnea became the second major symptom as for the covid-19 virus infection severe patients will have chest discomfort progressive dyspnea or acute respiratory distress syndrome symptoms 46 which indicates the aggravation of the disease as a result the proportion of dyspnea symptoms was slightly higher than other symptoms in our deaths also although there were cases with limb myalgia and fatigue headache and other initial symptoms came in a small quantity it does not mean that covid-19 cases presenting the symptoms are in mild condition there is still the possibility of progression to death which should arouse the vigilance of medical staff 47the emergence of a new infectious disease poses a particular challenge to epidemiologic research as identifying the characteristics of the disease and infection prevention and control of an epidemic is a step-by-step process during the period from 17 to 20 january 2020 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 increased 10-fold 48 indicating high infectivity of the novel coronavirus 49 such a disease needs to be contained or at least the spread of it needs to be reined in time otherwise the medical system will face enormous pressure and a large number of infected patients will inevitably die due to the lack of timely treatment during the covid-19 outbreak it is necessary to strengthen the training of medical personnel from all levels of medical institutions especially those serving at hospitals designated as the treatment center for the disease at the same time it is necessary to invest a multitude of resources in outpatient and emergency departments to detect patients to improve the treatment conditions and the capacity to house severe cases since the elderly and people with underlying diseases are most vulnerable to the attack of coronavirus and often have serious consequences 50 it is urgent to ramp up protection and prevention measures for the elderly especially those with chronic underlying diseases it also warns us that in the face of an unknown disease the protection of vulnerable people is essentialthis study has some limitations first the data of this study came from the panel data of the official website of the health commission of hubei province so the clinical information of the cases collected is limited second as our study focused on the deaths in the early stage of the outbreak and the fatalities constitute only a tiny fraction of the overall still-hiking death toll the specific relationship between male and female and the variations in the time window from onset to death and from admission to death among different age groups needs more large-scale studies this study represents characteristics of the earliest deaths in the early outbreak for covid-19 using the panel data in china we found that the elderly and people with underlying diseases dominated the death cases and the days from the first symptom to death gradually shortened with the increase of age in different age groups the male fatality count is higher than that of femalecoronavirus cov is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus 1 many kinds of mammals such as hedgehog pangolin civet and bat can serve as storage hosts of coronavirus 26 six covs have been identified to be pathogenic including four endemic hcov-oc43 229e nl63 and -hku1 and two epidemic sars-cov and mers-cov viruses 7 8 a cluster of cases of pneumonia was reported in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 on 11 february 2020 the diseases named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who and coronavirus study group csg of the international committee proposed to name the new coronavirus as sars-cov-2 up to 2 march 2020 at least 80 151 cases were reported httpwwwgovcnxinwen2020-0303content5486171htm most of the patients had a history of visiting hubei province or contacting people who had ever stayed in or passed by hubei province or were exposed to symptoms 9 some patients got infected through only asymptomatic contact this study aimed to report the epidemic features and lab identification of a patient confirmed with covid-19 infection through only asymptomatic contact fig 1
a 44-year-old man who lived in nanchang jiangxi province china got a fever of 388 c on 27 january 2020 he wore a mask and drove himself to see a doctor in a local hospital in nanchang on 30 january 2020 he was immediately hospitalized in an isolation room the pcr assay result was positive for the throat swab sample using a sars-cov-2 real-time rt-pcr kit fig 2 the patient was an instructor in a university and visited the city of huangmei hubei province he stayed with his parents and his brothers family but denied any exposure to a febrile patient or wild animals or visits to wet markets including the seafood market in wuhan
before the onset of symptoms the patient along with his wife and son drove from nanchang to honghu city hubei province on 23 january 2020 where his parents and brother lived they did not stop by any of the expressway service area after arriving they stayed at home and did not visit any public place in honghu city in addition his parents stayed at home for 20 days with his younger brothers family before they got back his younger brother and one of his brothers children visited wuhan on 5 january and came home on 6 january 2020 after staying with his parents and brothers family for 3 days the patient drove back to nanchang and arrived on 25 january on the way back home they stopped by tongshan service area hubei province without any close contact with other people after arriving home in nanchang city jiangxi province none of them left their residencethe patient began to have a cough on 27 january 2020 and took cefalexin capsules by himself fever symptoms appeared on 28 january with a maximum temperature of 388 c accompanied by cough sore throat headache fatigue muscle ache joint ache and other symptoms fig 3 the symptoms continued until he went to the doctor at the hospitals fever clinic he underwent blood routine examination and lung computed tomography ct examination fig 4
he was not obese and had no previous basic disease on admission 30 january 2020 the physical examination revealed a body temperature of 388 c a respiratory rate of 1921 breaths per minute a pulse of 6288 per minute and a blood pressure of 76128 mmhg the initial chest radiography showed a glass density shadow of both lungs fig 4a-bon 31 january 2020 the blood routine examination revealed the following white blood cell wbc count 74  109l lymphocyte ly count 06  106l another routine test on 31 january showed the wbc count of 44  109l and a decreased c-reactive protein level of 49 mgl the lung ct examination at 800 pm showed lung lesions significantly larger compared with those on the previous dayhowever high-resolution computed tomography on 3 february 2020 day 8 of illness revealed multiple ground-glass opacities located in both subpleural spaces fig 4c-d the blood routine examination showed mild changes in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts during admission he developed nasal congestion cough and pleuritic chest discomforthe received the following medicines treatment during hospitalization for 18 days including oral lopinavirritonavir 667167 mgkgday 12 h aerosol inhalation of interferon alpha 0833 gkgday 24 h oral lianhuaqingwen capsule 2333 mgkgday 8 h oral suhuang zhike capsule 225 mgkgday 8 h enteral nutrition 0833 gkgday 6 h thymalfasin for injection 2667 gkg3 days 72 h xuebijing injection 167 mlkgday 12 h in addition the hormone was only used for 5 days methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0667 mgkgday 24 h for 3 days methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0333 mgkgday 24 h for 1 day methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0167 mg kgday 24 h for 1 day and then stopping use hormonebefore the patients visit to honghu his relatives including his parents and brothers family had no disease or infection through contact or clustering after he was hospitalized the results of the coronavirus conventional pcr assay of his wife son brother and brothers wife performed once every other day were negative no farmers market was located near their residence the patient did not go to any farmers market his wife and son who were two close contacts with a final contact on 30 january 2020 had no symptoms or signs till 18 february 2020 figs 5 and 6
this patient was diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection his pcr test was positive but the test for seasonal influenza and adenovirus infection was negative despite flu-like symptoms and pneumonia during the first week of illness in this case report the covid-19 infection was diagnosed by a pcr test or based on clinical symptoms combined with a ct scan 10the duration from infection to the appearance of symptoms of sars-cov-2 was not exactly known 11 generally it was thought to be 14 days but a research group at guangzhou reported the longest incubation period of 24 days 12 in addition asymptomatic transmission of sars-cov-2 is an important topic and asymptomatic infections of sars-cov-2 could complicate disease control 13 the report of diamond princess showed that a large number of asymptomatic carriers might remain undiscovered in the community 14 mao et al reported that the asymptomatic ratio of covid-19 was 26 2 out of 78 confirmed cases 15 nishiura et al estimated 416 of cases among 565 japanese individuals evacuated from wuhan china were asymptomatic case 16 as of 4 april 2020 150 asymptomatic case out of 915 confirmed cases were reported in hong kong giving a ratio of 164 17 hu et al provided evidence for transmission from an asymptomatic infector to close contacts that result in severe covid-19 pneumonia 18 these findings suggest that asymptomatic carriers should be considered a source of covid-19 infection in this study the patients wife son parents and brothers family had no symptoms or signs between 5 january and 18 february 2020 after the patient was hospitalized rt-pcr tests of his wife son brother and brothers wife performed once every other day were negative their pcr results were negative probably because the virus was eliminated due to the long-time interval or the viral load was too low to be detected or the test results were false negative moreover the patients parents and nephews a and b did not undergo the rt-pcr test for sars-cov-2 infection and hence whether they were carriers was not confirmed no suspected or confirmed cases were reported in nanchang within 14 days of the departure of the patient from the site on 23 january therefore it was difficult to predict who might have passed the virus to the patient any of the relatives could have served as an intermediary of the virus except for his wife and son fig 7
this case report highlighted the possibility of developing sars-cov-2 infection through an asymptomatic contact it indicated the need for contact isolation especially for those who returned from the epidemic area without any symptoms 19 20 in addition this report suggested that in the early phase of covid-19 routine screening could miss diagnosing patients who were virus carriers the frequency of such transmissions of asymptomatic infection remains to be determined the scale of transmission through an asymptomatic contact during the early phase of infection should be explored urgentlyin conclusion this report indicated that highlighting travel history is of paramount importance for the early detection and isolation of sars-cov-2 cases the findings might be used as a reference for the prevention and control during this global outbreak of covid-19respiratory infections are common in the cold seasons world-wide and consequently considered trivial and mild affected individuals rarely consult medical professionals instead treating themselves with symptomatic medications droplet and aerosol transmission further facilitates rapid dissemination to numerous individuals at once which amplifies socioeconomic impact even with minimal increases to fatality rate particularly among patients with comorbiditiesthe latest and contemporary outbreak of a respiratory pathogen namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 responsible for coronavirus disease covid-19 has brought to attention a hidden threat from an old enemy this is the third major coronavirus outbreak over the past 20 years that has had substantial socioeconomic impact but the first in the 21st century to affect countries across all continents except antarctica the general panic and insecurity expressed across all sociopolitical and economic tiers has dramatically disrupted day-to-day life international travel and trade notwithstanding severe lifestyle disruptions depression-associated disease has been reported due to extreme measures of isolationhere we emphasize current knowledge regarding coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology diagnosis pathogenesis clinical manifestation as well as treatment and prevention strategies forward lessons informing future strategies to improve surveillance and prevent recurrence are highlightedsars-cov-2 belongs to the orthocoronavirinae subfamily family coronaviridae order nidovirales 1 it comprises of four subtypes - and -coronaviruses that can infect humans and gamma- and delta-coronaviruses which are found only in animals it is a zoonotic virus that can be transmitted from animals to humans and once adapted to do so between humans via airborne droplets and aerosols 2 the most involved carrier animal species for human infections is the bat 3 though animal reservoirs extend to cattle pigs turkeys camels mice dogs cats ferrets and mink 45 the first coronavirus infections were reported in 1960 as a cause for the common cold since then until 2002 four subtypes of coronaviruses were reported to infect humans two  coronaviruses - 229e and nl63 and 2  coronaviruses - oc43 and hku1 which routinely produce noncomplicated infections of the upper andor lower respiratory tract 3 then 2002 marked a key moment in our understanding of coronavirus-induced disease with the emergence of the first lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-causing coronavirus similarly to sars-cov-2 the original sars-cov emerged in guangdong province in china spreading through human transmission chains to infect at least 8096 individuals in 29 countries andsuccumb 774 patients 6 in 2012 a novel -coronavirus that had not previously been observed in humans was detected for the first time in a patient in saudi arabia since then the new coronavirus which causes middle eastern respiratory syndrome and is now known as mers-cov has infected 2494 individuals across 27 countries and led to the death of at least 858 individuals as of november 2019 through a series of emergences and re-emergences from camelid hosts 7 on december 8 2019 in wuhan hubei province china the first case was reported of a new coronavirus that produces pneumonia since then the new virus first named 2019-ncov and subsequently renamed sas-cov-2 was identified as a member of the -coronavirus subtype spread rapidly via human-to-human transmission at the time of authoring march 23 2020 over 317298 cases have been recorded worldwide across 166 countries with over 13642 deaths attributed to the virus 8 fig 1the emergence of virulence strains of coronavirus over the past 20 years has increased the interest of scientists regarding coronavirus strain variability distribution and the ability to be transmitted between animals to humans and further from humans-to-humans the strains have slightly different distributions across sex age and other demographic attributes for example whilst sars-cov-2 affects males more than females with substantial age-associated mortality increases in frail elderly subjects the four societally non-disruptive coronaviruses affect more females and children between 5 and 14 years 9in contrast sars-cov-1 affected more females and relatively young people with the median age of sars infected patients in guangzhou province china at 286 years 10 and mortality rate at 12 in people over 65 years 11 in comparison the mers coronavirus was more frequently detected among males and middle-aged adults aged 50-59 years 12 emerging data from hospitalized covid-19 cases in wuhan hubei province china indicate males 68 and middle-age adults in the age group of 50-59 years to be predominantly affected with a prevalence under 10 in people aged 39 years among these cases 51 had chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases 40 endocrine system disease 13 digestive system disease 11 respiratory system disease 1 malignant tumor 1 and nervous system disease 1 13 likewise data from italy as of 15320 indicate a median age of 64 years with middle aged 51-70 years old and elderly 757 predominantly male 598 patients experiencing mild 461 to severe 249 disease and the burden of mortality 70-79 years old case fatality ratio 125 80-89 years old 197 90 years old 227 14 whilst the older population demographics of italy is believed to drive the higher case fatality ratio differences 79 vs china 40 15 the italian healthcare system is experiencing increased requirement for intensive care unit icu admission 10 of cases 16 anecdotal reports from frontline clinicians in the principally affected regions in italy indicate all icu beds dedicated to covid-19 and patient admission to icumechanic ventilation restricted to age groups with a higher likelihood of survival of note these reports indicate 20 of icu cases to involve individuals under the age of 65 and as young as 20 years of age the reader is strongly advised to consider carefully the territory-specific diversity of case severity definition as well as the diagnostic triagedefinition criteria before making direct epidemiological comparisonsone additional aspect complicating case epidemiological oversight pertains to the highly mutagenic nature of coronaviruses which is common across rna viruses and has led to inappropriate comparative evolution interpretations and even the incorrect assertion of mild and sever covid-19 arising from separate strains of sars-cov-2 by comparing genomes of sequenced covid-19 strains it was shown that synonymous mutations in spike genes between covid-19 and rat or bat coronaviruses ratg13 and bat-sl-covzc45 were quite different the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions was 907 in covid-19 compared with ratg13 which was significantly higher than the 391 ratio from covid-19 to bat-sl-covzc45 17 additionally there were numerous concerns that covid-19 was an engineered bioweapon hypotheses fed by speculation that sequences from covid-19 were identical to those in hiv alignments showed that they are not present in any other coronavirus strains but show identitysimilarity with sequences in hiv-1 gp120 and gag the former being also a cellular receptor recognition protein 18 considering that these inserts appear in hyper-variable regions of the protein and are as short as 6 residues in length it is most probable that they arose naturally as a consequence the article describing these similarities was recently withdrawn from publication to date no evidence supports that sars-cov-2 is man-made covid-19 closely resembles two other coronaviruses that have triggered outbreaks in recent decades sars-cov-1 79 sequence identity and mers-cov 518 identity 19 and all three viruses are most likely to have originated in bats 1720 sars-cov-2 has a 96 sequence identity with a recently sequenced bat coronavirus recovered from the wild by random sampling 21a major question regarding coronavirus epidemiology is why does the bat of all animals play such a central role in coronavirus epidemiology studies in bats have identified viruses originating in this species as the potential vector to human infections additionally as bats live in colonies they present a high risk of transmitting the viruses horizontally intra-species which contributes to the vertical cross-species spreading ability this hypothesis is strongly favored by data on another high socioeconomic impact bat-derived virus the ebola virus which was shown to efficiently infect both bat and human cells 22 and to date remains the favored hypothesis for index case infection in the 2014-16 west african ebolavirus disease outbreakadditional evidence of bat to human indirect transmission comes from the covid-19s spike protein and ace2 receptor interactions 23 indeed the two highly pathogenic strains of coronaviruses - sars-cov and mers-cov were identified both in bat species and in animals involved in transmission to humans 20 it is interesting to note that the first highly pathogenic strain of coronavirus sars-cov-1 has a low genetic similarity with other known coronaviruses 39 with bovine coronavirus and 46 with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 24 recently three comparison studies were made with coronavirus strains from pangolins the first february 18 2020 compared the sequences of covid-19 with the coronaviruses in illegally trafficked pangolins to show a sequence similarity between 855 and 924 25 with the subsequent papers february 20 2020 reporting sequence similarities with pangolin coronaviruses at 9023 26 and 9102 27 respectively however the -coronavirus strains that cause human disease were also originally identified in bats 28 it is therefore not surprising that covid-19 shares 96 genetic similarity whole genome level with a coronavirus isolated from chinese bat species 21 another important question is why china china is the third-largest country by surface area worldwide but the most populated country its varied land characteristics and diverse climate range supports huge biodiversity which contributes to enabling transmission of viruses between animal populations principally however co-habitation of animals and humans in close proximity and gastronomic customs involving the consumption of a variety of exotic animals including wild fauna such as bats increases the chance of vertical transmission throughout the food supply chain officially live-bird markets have been closed however black-market vendors run illegal slaughterhouses that are crowded places with poor ventilation where a number of species are hoarded together these create ideal conditions for the spreading of the virus through airborne droplets of blood and other secretions or shared cages trade tools and utensils allowing for an amplification of vertical transmission risk the prevalence of such culinary and wild animal handling practices in southern china have been causally linked to both the 2002 sars-cov-1 outbreak starting from a market in shenzen guangdong china 29 and the entry of sars-cov-2 into the human population of the original 41 cases presenting with pneumonia of unknown origin two thirds had links to huanan seafood wholesale market that also sold live animals 30such a species barrier bridge has been also documented with filovirus disease outbreaks in africa wherein high risk infectious agents are routinely detected in bushmeat markets and the associated human population both by pcr and immunoprecipitation methods 31 as with china human and animal close contact and often co-habitation remains common in rural african areas with practically no barriers to wild environments eg tropical forests such exposure data have fed debates on the role of so-called herd immunity through natural exposure to emerging tropical or perhaps rural zoonoses it is noteworthy that comparable risks have been documented with viruses not typically associated with highly biodiverse geographies or the consumption of wild meat for example the 2012 outbreak of mers-cov in the middle east and the arab peninsula specifically was shown to involve both local and international city dwellers with no previous exposure to the natural camelid host that continues to be in close contact with rural populations fig 2 3233 the direct impact on individual health of zoonoses and indirect impact on health-care systems as evidenced through the covid-19 outbreak underscore how increasingly urban population organisation even among developing nations amplifies the risk of onward human transmission despite past exposure and indeed immunity in settings with blurred wild-human habitat barriersthe genome of coronaviruses contains genes for the 4 structural proteins envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n and spike s coronavirus virions are lipid bilayer-enveloped particles variable in size 80-160 nm characterized by multiple 20-nm spike-like extensions on the surface in the form of corolla or flower petals at the virion core a nucleocapsid with icosahedral symmetry contains an electron-dense layer with a center that is clear its genomic nucleic acid consists of is single-stranded positive rna which requires a negative rna replication cycle intermediate that generates subgenomic protein coding rnas as well as genomic rna for virion assembly the core also features accessory proteins that differ considerably between various types of coronavirusesthe lipidic envelope features the trimerically-organised type i transmembrane spike glycoproteins which consist of the ectodomain subunits s1 and s2 protruding externally a transmembrane anchor and a tail extending towards the viral core 34 cell attachment involves the s1 subunit interacting with host cell surface receptors driving endocytosis and after membrane fusion with the involvement of subunit s2 35 release of the virion core into the cytosolic milieu the glycoproteins of coronaviruses mediate attachment fusion and entry in the host cells but different parts of those glycoproteins are involved in each of these processes these class i viral membrane-fusion proteins undergo structural rearrangements that produce fusion between the viral and cellular membranes glycoprotein conformational changes and cathepsin l proteolysis within endosomes are also involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus fig 3 thus whilst cleavage of s protein is required to expose the hydrophobic fusion peptide it seems that receptor interaction is required for the cleavage to occur 36 historically immunotherapies and many exploratory small molecule treatments have targeted such host-pathogen interactions to disrupt infection however experience across multiple virus strains indicates such monotherapy to be inefficient due to mutational escapeaccessory proteins play a definitive role in infectivity however their functions are not yet fully understood it is speculated that some proteins play important roles in countering the immune response thus viruses that lack these have a lower infectivity for example sars-cov-1 has two accessory proteins 3a and 3b that play potential roles in the virulence of this strain 37 on the other hand sometimes a complete infectious particle can be assembled without spike proteins indicating that accessory proteins can substitute these 38 therefore there is a potential risk that a vaccine targeting structural proteins alone such as the spike protein might be inefficient driving evolutionary escape of the virus either through target protein mutation or by favouring virions utilizing other accessory proteins for attachment a some-what more viral escape-proof approach involves targeting of the receptor-binding domain rbd which is a conserved domain of s protein 39 notably other respiratory viruses that efficiently cross species barriers eg influenza require close monitoring and annual adjustment of epitope targeting to minimize spread and impactthe primary receptor used by coronaviruses to enter into target cells is the angiotensin-converting-enzyme ii ace2 receptor 2140 although some strains also use other alternative receptors such as cd209l for which they have a lower affinity 41 whilst there is no evidence in pre- or post-publication literature currently that sars-cov-2 also utilizes cd209l for cell entry this potential attachment mechanism cannot be excluded until experimental data thereto are produced likewise other as yet unidentified receptors facilitate coronavirus cellular entry in the absence of ace2 in hepatocytes and some enterocytes 42 sars-cov-2 in particular also appears to use the sars-cov receptor ace2 to enter cells although the spike protein between sars-cov-1 and -2 vary in sequence xu et al 43 suggested that the spike protein binding affinity for ace2 is conserved as the 3d structure of the receptor binding domain is identical with that of sars-cov-1 which would translates to equal infectivity the analysis of protein-protein interaction using bioinformatics showed that sars nucleocapsidal proteins bind to human cyclophilin a hcypa and this binding was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance spr technology the 3d modelling detected the probable binding sites and allowed deduction of important interaction between residue pairs 44 wan and colleagues observed that several amino acids in the receptor-binding motif of sars-cov-2 allow binding to human ace2 even though with suboptimal strength 45 a recent study demonstrated that a mutation in the spike protein n501t of sars-cov-2 enhanced the affinity for ace2 45ace2 is highly expressed in the respiratory tract particularly in epithelial cells of the bronchi alveoli both type i and ii cells trachea and bronchial serous glands as well as in macrophages and alveolar monocytes notably the expression in the lung cells is much higher than in trachea 46 in line with the expression profile of ace2 viral genome load has been consistently reported to be both more elevated in the lower than in the upper respiratory tract with lower respiratory specimens being additionally less prone to false negative results 4748 ace2 is also diffusely located on other cells such as mucosal cells of the intestines endothelial cells of veins and arteries including heart cells epithelial cells of the renal tubules epithelial cells of the kidneys immune cells and cerebral neuronal cells which may also be susceptible to coronavirus infections the observation of covid-19 patient demise on account of severe heart failure brought about by sars-cov-2 infection and the higher risk among patients with previous cardiovascular and hypertensive disease has driven multiple hypotheses regarding potential direct mechanisms of viral action on the circulatory system thus ace2 expression can be increased as a result of using drugs such as ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers arbs indeed it was shown that expression of ace2 is increased in diabetes patients another high risk covid-19 group treated with ace inhibitors and hypertension patients treated with arbs ace2 expression can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen therefore in these categories of patients the risk of infection with covid-19 is proposed to be higher 49 yet whilst the nl63 coronavirus strain binds to the same ace2 receptor as sars-cov-2 it produces only upper respiratory tract disease this indicates that there are other unknown factors apart from the presence of receptors that influence the susceptibility of cells to coronavirus infection insights into the differentiation factors influencing coronavirus strain-specific outcomes come from recent data on host co-factors mediating sars-cov-2 fusion thus sars-cov-2 uses the serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming camostat mesylate an inhibitor of tmprss2 blocked covid-19 infection of lung cells but inhibition was more substantial when the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin bl catbl was also inhibited eg with e-64d 40 these results point to a complex interplay of host factors in the endosome with the spike protein in mediating virion fusion it is thus speculated that in infected cells furin-mediated precleavage at the s1s2 site can promote tmprss2-dependent entry as in the case of mers-cov 40 mers-cov however is an exception to the sars coronavirus set as it uses at hedipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp-4 surface antigen as a receptor and not ace2 the relative expression of these endosomal factors and similarly active proteins across cell types as well as alternative receptors that mediate cellular attachment require urgent scrutiny to understand cell type tropism and more crucially extra-pulmonary reservoirs and sites of replication some of these extrapulmonary reservoirs have been suggested by ct scans showing shadows and interstitial changes in tissues separate to the lungs 50 which require molecular and cellular studies to confirm direct involvement in virus replication as opposed to pathological findings secondary to sars-cov-2 infectionafter coronaviruses infect primary cells the mature virions can be released and infect other target cells 51 infective viral particles can be found in sweat stool urine and respiratory secretions from patients with other coronaviruses with viable sars-cov-2 so far documented in respiratory droplets saliva mechanically generated aerosols and faeces after excretion environmental contamination can be substantial fomites presenting what is currently believed to be the primary mode of human-to-human transmission for up to 7 days after surface deposition of the virus the development of atypical pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration and failure determined by coronavirus infection is associated with increased levels of activated pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines 52 thus it has been proposed that vitamin d plays a role in the modulation of the immune response to infectious agents based on laboratory findings and observational studies however randomized clinical trials have returned inconclusive often controversial results therefore it has been suggested that cholecalciferol at elevated doses might be useful for the prevention and therapy of infection with covid-19 5354in the pathogeny of coronavirus infection an important role is played by the amplitude of host immunity for example canonical interferon levels terminate protein synthesis or even induce cell death however the intensity of the immune response can vary depending on other comorbidities of the patient explaining the role of these in the evolution of the disease indeed the majority of deaths have occurred among individuals with comorbidities 55 in a nationwide study from china 21 of patients with covid-19 had cancer however no patient had liver transplantation or inflammatory bowel disease 74 of the patients had diabetes and 15 hypertension 56 the death rate is expected to be higher in immunocompromised patients however this is not established to date on the other hand it seems that the exacerbated immune reaction in covid-19 infection is the one that leads to the greatest pulmonary and systemic damagemers-cov has a lower infectivity compared to sars-cov-2 thus an intense and prolonged exposure is necessary in order for the virus to enter the lungs mers-cov uses dpp-4 as a cell receptor 57 dpp-4 is expressed in a wide variety of epithelial cells with localization in the alveoli kidneys liver small intestine prostate and activated leukocytes that determine the higher tropism of mers-cov compared to other coronaviruses 58the genome of sars-cov-2 was sequenced during the early stages of the outbreak enabling the ultrafast development of point-of-care tests based on rt-pcr for the new covid-19 infection within 2 weeks of its discovery 45 in line with past predictions of rapid response 59 httpsdoiorg101039c7sc03281a to date however these are available only in kit format for benchtop real time pcr systems requiring substantial manual processing 5-8 h minimal data turnaround emergency use authorization eua for the use of thesesimilar assays in a handful of the numerous regulator-approved point-of-care integrated extraction-amplification systems eg biofire genexpert etc was obtained only on march 22 2020 an unacceptable 3 months into the outbreak consequently despite the tremendous need for mass screening and isolation of infected cases sample processing bottlenecks have forced most health authorities and governments worldwide to restrict testing only to clinically complex hospitalized cases conversely experience from countries with early outbreak experience such as korea singapore hong kong taiwan italy and indeed china shows that mass testing case isolation and contact tracing can reduce human transmission even to zero indeed presently the risk to these countries appears restricted to new case introduction from abroad justifying measures seeking to halt international traveldiagnostic process notwithstanding a major drawback lies with the diagnostic sensitivity of preferred as opposed to available samples thus data from the chinese centres for disease control and prevention as well as clinical centres at the epicenter of the outbreak have reinforced world health organisation technical diagnostic guidelines 60 that require a lower respiratory sample as well as an upper respiratory sample to rule out sars-cov-19 as the causal agent of viral pneumonia and covid-19-like disease the simplest upper respiratory sample is presented in the form of an oral andor nasal swab or combination of both given the handful of reported nasal swab negatives in the presence of oral swab positives lower respiratory specimens are difficult to obtain as they require either intubated patients tracheal aspirates or anesthesia bronchoalveolar lavage bronchial brushings notwithstanding risk of injury to the patient these invasive procedures create infectious aerosol generation risks and are contraindicated the only suitable surrogate sample is lung sputum but only if this is naturally available to minimize aerosol generation risk unfortunately the chinese experience has been that 30 of covid-19 suspected cases generate sputum thereby restricting testing to oral or nasal swabs these however have a reported false negative rate of between 10-37 4748 with oral swab false negative rates on account of low analytical sensitivity reaching up to 68 these statistics point underscore the impact of sampling process variability beyond anatomical differences - one healthcare professionals swabbing technique may differ vastly to another- and emphasize the need for standardizingautomating the sampling process to increase diagnostic test reliability even for respiratory samples a significant additional complicating factor is the limited understanding of sample viral load across the exposure-symptomatic-convalescence continuum onset of shedding and disparity between genome copy detected by rt-pcr vs infectious virion copy number which collectively amplify the well-established issues around operator error in sampling methods of interest early data suggest viral shed-ding may indeed start as early as one week ahead of symptoms and transmission may peak up to 3 days before symptoms 61 the data if accepted and validated in separate studies will compound the impact of transmission risk attributed to asymptomatic or subclinical individuals and will emphasize the need for more aggressive contact tracing testing even onto random mass population screening will be needed to arrest transmission as anecdotal evidence suggests from a single town in italy where the combination of lockdown contact tracing and testing eliminated new cases whilst transmission remained rampant elsewhere in the country 62on the other hand there is particular importance attributed by a number of western governments to serological assays that monitor the production of antibody responses to pathogens at first glance these tests are exceedingly appealing due to their lower cost 50-100 and time-to-results 30-48 as compared to rt-qpcr in a diagnostic lab or indeed when using automated point of care rt-qpcr systems 20 lower cost and 6-12 faster in addition antibody tests can offer a clear answer as to the spread of exposure that may involve asymptomatic or low-grade respiratory disease supporting so called herd immunity however evidence from multiple asian countries and italy show transmission containment was achieved and can be achieved using rt-qpcr which documents infectious cases antibody responses do not initiate until at least a week after the onset of symptoms meaning that the deployment of antibody tests for mass screening will have an enhanced risk of false negatives as compared to oronasal swab rt-qpcr by missing pre-symptomatic asymptomatic and newly symptomatic cases whilst the research and academic value in understanding asymptomatic spread is undisputed the magnitude of the socioeconomic damage by covid-19 in redirecting resources away from confirmation of active infection in mildly symptomatic cases and asymptomatic contacts onto exposure numbers is likely to extend transmission long beyond the period of a few weeks documented in china and korea into months extending the impact onto healthcare systems furthermore such an extension of spread risks the development of cycles of infection and socioeconomic damage with the re-introduction of new index cases within country regions and into countries free of the disease the increasing risk of virus evolution and its establishment as a seasonal endemic respiratory disease agent crucially does not take into account how immunity to other coronaviruses appears to be short-lived we simply do not know yet if covid-19 convalescence will protect from re-infection and if it does for how longthe predominant symptoms of sars-cov-1 are respiratory in nature associated with fever and diarrhea clinical manifestations among patients are diverse from mild-moderate to severe-life threatening symptoms the virus has a mean incubation period of 46 days 63 however in the majority of cases symptoms appear after 10 days 64 in severe cases the median time from the appearance of symptoms until artificial ventilation is 11 days and 237 days until the patients death 65 the clinical manifestations are similar to flu-like symptoms such as fever a dry cough myalgia dyspnea headache sore throat sputum production rhinorrhea 6667 in 40-70 of cases watery diarrhea appears within 1 week after the first manifestations 42 in the elderly the symptoms can also be associated with confusion a poor appetite and a decrease in general well-being in is noteworthy that the symptomatology in children below 12 years is mild no mortality has been registered among children and teenagers asymptomatic cases are reported to be rare 6368 increased levels of c-reactive protein lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase have been observed in laboratory tests the infection manifests in two different stages with the first-week characterized by flu-like symptoms that improve even if the viral loads persist and a recurrent period during the second week in which respiratory failure can appear and more than 20 of patients may require mechanic ventilation 69 the respiratory system is the main affected area in the human body where the infection determines the appearance of diffuse alveolar damage squamous metaplasia giant-cell infiltrates and increased macrophage levels in the interstitium and the alveoli 46unlike sars-cov-1 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has a wide variety of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic to severe respiratory symptoms the mean incubation period is 5-6 days 70-73 in severe cases death can occur within 11-13 days after the onset of the disease 7073 the clinical manifestations are similar to flu-like symptoms such as general myalgia fever chills malaise associated with confusion pulmonary symptoms such as cough shortness of breath dyspnea and pneumonia extra-pulmonary clinical manifestations include abdominal disorders nausea diarrhea vomiting acute renal failure and neurological complications 74 the severity of the disease is associated with an increasing age and with individuals with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus renal and pulmonary diseases death can occur after the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards multiorgan failure or septic shock 7 the neurological complications of the infection with mers-cov are associated with the in vitro ability of the virus to invade the central nervous system 75 although it was not detected in the csf among the neurological manifestations confusion has been reported in 257 and seizures in 86 of cases 76 severe neurological complications are encephalitis stroke polyneuropathy acute disseminated encephalomyelitis guillain barr syndrome and bickerstaffs encephalitis usually the neurological complications appear at a delayed time point from the respiratory symptoms namely 2-3 weeks from the onset of the clinical manifestation of the disease and can be underdiagnosed 7477-79 children are rarely affected 74 in laboratory tests thrombocytopenia lymphopenia neutrophilia leucocytosis reduced renal functions and increased inflammatory markers have been observed similar to sars-cov-1 the pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated viral-mediated lung damage is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage the virus has been determined in multinucleated epithelial cells pneumocytes and bronchial submucosal glands apart from the respiratory system the virus has also been identified in the epithelial cells of the proximal renal tubules 58 acute tubular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis have been observed in renal biopsies collected from persons infected with mers-cov 80the latest high clinical burden coronavirus sars-cov-2 presents a wide variety of clinical manifestations which are not yet fully characterized 8182 the virus has a mean incubation period of 3-7 days and no more than 14 days 30 - although anecdotal reports likely related to poor contact tracing have suggested potentially up to 24 days of incubation outside hubei province the median incubation period has been estimated to be 51 days 95 ci 45 to 58 with 97 of infected subjects developing symptoms within 115 days of infection 83 in a retrospective study on 99 patients that have confirmed covid-19 pneumonia treated in an infec-tious diseases hospital in wuhan china it was shown that the main clinical manifestations were flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough 83 and 81 of the cases shortness of breath 31 of cases muscle ache 11 of cases and less frequently confusion 9 headache 8 sore throat rhinorrhea and chest pain in less than 2 of patients extra-pulmonary symptoms and diarrhea nausea and vomiting were also observed as complications ards was reported in 17 of cases followed by acute respiratory injury 8 septic shock 4 acute renal injury 3 and ventilator-associated pneumonia 1 death occurred in 11 of participants in the study determined by multiple organ failure the main finding in laboratory tests was lymphopenia the severity of the disease was associated with co-infections smoking history hypertension and age 13 another retrospective study on 137 patients infected with covid-19 revealed the same pattern of clinical manifestations with fever cough and muscle pain and less frequently diarrhea headache and even heart palpitations in some cases 50 lymphopenia was observed in 723 of cases associated with normal or decreased white blood cell counts 50 the lung is the main organ affected in the imaging examination by computer tomography or x-ray lesions were identified in multiple lung lobes presented as patchypunctate ground-glass opacities ggo patchy consolidation irregular solid nodules and fibrous stripes 5084-86 studies that have investigated the pulmonary pattern of covid-19 pneumonia have demonstrated that the disease progresses rapidly and ct re-examination after 3-14 days has revealed significant changes in lung structure the single ggo observed in the early stages can increase significantly in short-term re-examination the same has also occurred with fibrous stripes observed in the early stages that consolidate in short-term re-examination in some cases the irregular solid nodules observed in the early stages increased and merged in short-term re-examination short-term repeated imaging scans should be carried out in patients with covid-19 pneumonia for monitoring the evolution and for specific management of the patient as the disease can rapidly progress or indeed resolve 8687 the peak of lung abnormalities was reached on day 10 following the onset of symptoms followed by a decrease in symptomatology 87it was documented that in one third of the severely ill patients death occurs because the covid-19 coronavirus produce acute myocardial injury and damage to the cardiovas-cular system in general that further degrade the state of these already very ill patients 88the treatment for all types of coronaviruses is mainly supportive as no specific treatment has been discovered to date for the treatment of sars-cov-1 apart from supportive measures several therapeutic schemes have been implemented with varying success rates such as antiviral therapy with riba-virin 89 protease inhibitors - lopinavir and ritonavir alone or associated with ribavirin 6790 interferon-alfacon-1 91 systemic corticosteroids 8992 and convalescent plasma for passive immunotherapy 93 apart from convalescent plasma none of these treatments have exhibited significant benefits compared to the side-effects producedfor mers-cov infections taking as an example the early sars-cov-1 epidemic supportive care was primarily used and in some instances broad-spectrum antibacterials antivirals such as ribavirin alone or in combination with interferon-22b 9495 and antifungals have been used to prevent the co-infection with other opportunistic pathogens 9697 mycophenolic acid is another drug that exhibited efficacy in monotherapy on a small number of patients however further studies are required to confirm these effects 9899in the case of the new covid-19-associated pneumonia treatment also focuses on supportive care measures and symptomatic treatment following the example of sars-cov-1 treatment the administration of systemic corticosteroids was attempted although this did not exhibit any benefits in the case of patients with severe evolution immunoglobulin g was administered 50 the application of early respiratory support improved the prognosis and the recovery of the patients 50 in a 54-year-old korean man infected with sars-cov-2 the administration of the combination lopinavirritonavir from day 10 of illness determined the decrease in viral load till no detectable levels 100 the question of whether the decrease in viral load was associated with the natural course of the healing process or with antiviral treatment or both is being currently investigated in order to confirm the efficacy of antiviral treatment for covid-19 the efficacy of remdesivir gilead sciences a nucleotide analog in inhibiting in vitro and in vivo sars-cov-1 mers-cov and bat cov strains that are capable to replicate in human airway epithelial cells render it a good choice for testing on newly affected covid-19 patients 85101-103 taking into consideration that covid-19 binds to human ace2 in order to penetrate human cells and to induce severe pneumonia the renin-angiotensin system acei angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and at1r angiotensin ii type-i receptor inhibitors have been suggested to modify individual susceptibility to covid-19 by influencing sars-cov-2 virulence however further studies are needed to confirm the mechanisms involved including the role of high ace2 expression and to consider possible changes in administration and dosage of antihypertensive drugs 4649104 thus far the professional association for hypertension therapy usa has warned against changes in hypertensive drugs following concerns about a possible increased susceptibility to covid-19 httpsish-worldcomnewsaa-statement-from-the-international-society-of-hypertension-on-covid-19 interest has arisen also on the old off-patent antimalarial drug chloroquine and its less toxic hydroxychloroquine analog both of which are quinine derivatives cinchoca tree bark south america preliminary support from observations of potential inhibitory activity against sars-cov-2 105106 clearly needs to be confirmed through randomized controlled trials there are also ongoing trials using monoclonal antibodies one of them is tocilizumab an anti-il6 antibody currently in phase iii clinical trials with commercial name actemra produced by roche 107 sarilumab a drug used in rheumatoid arthritis is about to enter clinical trials for covid-19 infection according to regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi respectively 108in order to facilitate covid-19 virus replication certain in vivo conditions such as the ph value the temperature humidity and the sufficiency of oxygen supply should be ensured consequently in order to hinder the reproduction procedures of the virus it would be expedient to disturb the environment of the virus by interfering with the temperature or the ph values or both sars-cov-2 has been speculated to be a seasonal virus in which case a hindrance of the rapid spread that characterizes it at ambient temperatures over 25-30 celsius would be observed unfortunately the sup-tropicalarid environments favored by sars-cov-1 and mers-cov as well as the comparatively higher temperatures in israel egypt the arab peninsula and now sub-saharan africa compared to hubei province indicate that temperature probably does not affect covid-19 replication likewise the ambient humidity levels thought to impact aerosol and droplet suspension timetravel distance and by extension virus transmission do not seem to affect onward transmission chains across geographical regions alteration of the ph value inside the human body within tolerable levels however is achievable such an intervention would not only suppress replication of the virus but also may have - although possibly weak - virucidal effect a ph value change with no negative impact on the health of the patient could be achieved by administering a drug that would lead to urine acidosis and endocellular alkalosis this drug could be a simple small molecule with hydrophobic weak base properties which would accumulate in lysosomes after having crossed both plasma and lysosomal membranes by diffusion perhaps such a medicine may express both a therapeutic and a prophylactic effect by increasing the environmental barriers to effective virus attachment in early endosomal pathways and preventing spike proteolysis required for capsid release and cell membrane fusion within lysosomes in line with cathepsin protease-targeted therapies given the success of combination therapy strategies in other antiviral diseases centered on virus fusion andor replication promoting endocellular alkalosis during antiviral drug therapy eg replication inhibitors could amplify antiviral effect and thereby contribute to the reduction of the treatment period 109-113although since 2004 the world health organization issued guidelines for the prevention of re-emergence of new coronavirus virulent strains 114 implementation has evidently been inadequate key recommendations include the availability of the early detection of infected individuals to prevent the spread of emergent and re-emergent infection particularly to prevent international spread the development of contingency plans by each country for the management and detection of coronavirus individualized by the risks that exist locally preparing global and assisting national risk assessments updating new discoveries assisting countries in their efforts to improve protection against infections assessing the availability of all necessary resources in the case of an outbreak and supporting the international scientific collaboration for sars study unfortunately all of these strategies could not prevent the current outbreak and after 17 years the medical scientific and governmental structures have demonstrated that they are not adequately prepared to effectively contain highly pathogenic viruses the main measures that should be taken for preventing the dissemination of pathogens in the general population are associated with infection control measures both in healthcare facilities and in the community contact tracing and quarantine or the isolation of those suspected of infection along with the education of the population has proven essential in preventing community transmission of the viruses both in developing nations west african and democratic republic of congo ebola virus outbreaks developed nations eg hong kong south korea sars and mers outbreaks and now practically all g20 nations the lack of local implementation of what are demonstrably effective measures as learned since the sars-cov-1 outbreak due to scientific chauvinism over healthcare standards between east and west population anthropology between africa and europe in terms of communication strategy and behaviour or indeed local vs international experience between eg the uk and italy with emerging threats is lamentable going forward the identification of natural reservoirs and intermediate hosts for existing and future risks as identifiable through random sampling and monitoring 21 will become essential in preventing future zoonotic virus outbreaks unfortunately these alarms were raised repeatedly over the past two decades with minimal heed perhaps the damage brought by covid-19 onto global economy and healthcare systems will transform the field of tropical emergent diseasea good example of positive action are the actions of currently more than 40 teams developing vaccines against sars-cov-2 infection 115 interest is largely spurred by the unprecedented success and rapid development of ebolavirus vaccines during the west african outbreak covid-19 vaccines can be based on the viral rna or derivatives examples include innovio and moderna in usa as well as curevac germany and another team at imperial college in london rna and dna vaccines have the advantage of being quick to develop and high likelihood of safety though no rna vaccine or therapeutic currently enjoys regulatory approval the institute pasteur in france is working on a traditional covid-19 vaccine based on a sars vaccine cansino biologics developed a recombinant coronavirus vaccine incorporating adenovirus type 5 vector ad5 to date clinical trials have been initiated by moderna therapeutics and cansino biologics 115 with further trials shortly anticipated in the uk and other european countriesa sobering note however is that despite the ample amounts of research performed on coronaviruses over the past 20 years particularly following the sars-cov-1 outbreak no vaccine is unfortunately yet available for either sars-cov-1 or mers although some potential vaccines have reached as far as phase i clinical trials 116-118 some of the strategies used for vaccines are eliciting neutralizing-antibody for s proteins and t-cell responses 119 which seem to be jointly required for convalescence rather than simply neutralizing antibody titers the quest for protective immunity to coronavirus is but nascent and virology offers a plethora of high socioeconomic impact high prevalence rna viruses for whom decades of vaccine research have yet to deliver successthe guangdong region of china was considered a high-risk area for a coronavirus outbreak after the sars-cov-1 epidemic in 2002 nevertheless although a large amount of research and efforts have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks a coronavirus outbreak occurred again in 2019 unfortunately healthcare systems locally nationally and now internationally have again been overcome as with the other two major coronavirus outbreaks the evidence from covid-19 is clear that highly aggressive measures are necessary to break the transmission chain in the regions at risk - practically most countries globally at the time of authoring unfortunately there is no specific prevention strategy against the new coronavirus and its pandemic status restrict the global community to two options effective measures for the immediate prevention of respiratory infections with predictable and measurable consequences or ambitions of herd or vaccine-derived immunity at a non-specific time in the future we can only hope that after this third significant outbreak sufficient experience has been gained a joint effort of the worldwide health authorities will be needed in extinguishing the current epidemic it can only be trusted that this experience will re-emphasize the need for prevention and readiness and for further studies to limit the transmission of animal viruses to humans and mitigation should it arise again in the futurethe outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019-ncov pneumonia initially developed in one of the largest cities wuhan hubei province of china in early december 2019 and has been declared the sixth public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization and subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of february 20 2020 a total of 75000 cumulative confirmed cases and 2130 deaths have been documented globally in 26 countries across 5 continents current studies reveal that respiratory symptoms of covid-19 such as fever dry cough and even dyspnea represent the most common manifestations at presentation similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome in 2012 which is firmly indicative of droplet transmission and contact transmission however the incidence of less common features like diarrhea nausea vomiting and abdominal discomfort varies significantly among different study populations along with an early and mild onset frequently followed by typical respiratory symptoms1 mounting evidence from former studies of sars indicated that the gastrointestinal tract intestine tropism of sars coronavirus sars-cov was verified by the viral detection in biopsy specimens and stool even in discharged patients which may partially provide explanations for the gastrointestinal symptoms potential recurrence and transmission of sars from persistently shedding human as well2 notably the first case of 2019-ncov infection confirmed in the united states reported a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting on admission and then passed a loose bowel movement on hospital day 2 the viral nucleic acids of loose stool and both respiratory specimens later tested positive3 in addition 2019-ncov sequence could be also detected in the self-collected saliva of most infected patients even not in nasopharyngeal aspirate and serial saliva specimens monitoring showed declines of salivary viral load after hospitalization4 given that extrapulmonary detection of viral rna does not mean infectious virus is present further positive viral culture suggests the possibility of salivary gland infection and possible transmission4 more recently 2 independent laboratories from china declared that they have successfully isolated live 2019-ncov from the stool of patients unpublished taken together a growing number of clinical evidence reminds us that digestive system other than respiratory system may serve as an alternative route of infection when people are in contact with infected wild animals or sufferers and asymptomatic carriers or individuals with mild enteric symptoms at an early stage must have been neglected or underestimated in previous investigations clinicians should be careful to promptly identify the patients with initial gastrointestinal symptoms and explore the duration of infectivity with delayed viral conversionto date molecular modelling has revealed by the next-generation sequencing technology that 2019-ncov shares about 79 sequence identify with sars-cov indicative of these 2 lineage b -coronaviruses highly homologous and angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 previously known as an entry receptor for sars-cov was exclusively confirmed in 2019-ncov infection despite amino acid mutations at some key receptor-binding domains5

6 it is widely accepted that coronavirus human transmissibility and pathogenesis mainly depend on the interactions including virus attachment receptor recognition protease cleaving and membrane fusion of its transmembrane spike glycoprotein s-protein receptor-binding domain specific cell receptors ace2 and host cellular transmembrane serine protease tmprss with binding affinity of 2019-ncov about 73 of sars-cov7 recent bioinformatics analysis on available single-cell transcriptomes data of normal human lung and gastrointestinal system was carried out to identify the ace2-expressing cell composition and proportion and revealed that ace2 was not only highly expressed in the lung at2 cells but also in esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon8 with the increasing gastrointestinal wall permeability to foreign pathogens once virus infected enteric symptoms like diarrhea will occur by the invaded enterocytes malabsorption which in theory indicated the digestive system might be vulnerable to covid-19 infection in contrast because ace2 and tmprss especially tmprss2 are co-localized in the same host cells and the latter exerts hydrolytic effects responsible for s-protein priming and viral entry into target cells further bioinformatics investigation renders additional evidence for enteric infectivity of covid-19 in that the high co-expression ratio was found in absorptive enterocytes and upper epithelial cells of esophagus besides lung at2 cells however the exact mechanism of covid-19induced gastrointestinal symptom largely remains elusive based on these considerations ace2-based strategies against covid-19 such as ace2 fusion proteins and tmprss2 inhibitors should be accelerated into clinical research and development for diagnosis prophylaxis or treatmentlast mild to moderate liver injury including elevated aminotransferases hypoproteinemia and prothrombin time prolongation has been reported in the existing clinical investigations of covid-19 whereas up to 60 of patients suffering from sars had liver impairment the presence of viral nucleic acids of sars in liver tissue confirmed the coronavirus direct infection in liver and percutaneous liver biopsies of sars showed conspicuous mitoses and apoptosis along with atypical features such as acidophilic bodies ballooning of hepatocytes and lobular activities without fibrin deposition or fibrosis9 it is believed that sars-associated hepatotoxicity may be likely with viral hepatitis or a secondary effect associated with drug toxicity owing to high-dose consumption of antiviral medications antibiotics and steroids as well as immune system overreaction however little is known about 2019-ncov infection in liver surprisingly recent single cell rna sequencing data from 2 independent cohorts revealed a significant enrichment of ace2 expression in cholangiocytes 597 of cells instead of hepatocytes 26 of cells suggesting that 2019-ncov might lead to direct damage to the intrahepatic bile ducts10 altogether substantial effort should be made to be alert on the initial digestive symptoms of covid-19 for early detection early diagnosis early isolation and early interventionthe novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 or coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 is a highly infectious respiratory virus that emerged in wuhan china and has posed a serious threat to human health worldwide since december 2019 as of march 31 2020 a total of 697 244 confirmed cases including 33 257 deaths have been reported for covid19 in a growing number of international locations available from httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019the most common presentations of covid19 include fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough shortness of breath and dyspnea however concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms mainly diarrhea and vomiting have also been reported in some studies of the recent outbreak

 sarscov2 is an rna virus and the nucleic acid has been detected in the feces of some patients with pneumonia who are diagnosed with novel coronavirus infection which probably indicates the presence of live viruses in the feces as well as the possibility of a fecaloral route of viral transmission this observation presents a new challenge to the diagnosis and control of covid19 in this article we review the enteric manifestations in patients with covid19 based on current literature reports and aim to provide a diagnostic and preventive strategy from the gastroenterological perspectivehuman coronaviruses hcov comprise two of the following genera alpha coronavirus hcov229e and hcovnl63 and beta coronavirus hcovhku1 hcovoc43 middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov and the newly discovered sarscov2 while respiratory complaints are usually the most common presenting symptoms of hcov infection concurrent or isolated gastrointestinal manifestations characterized primarily by diarrhea nausea and vomiting and elevated liver enzymes should not be ignored after infection with hcov up to 30 of patients with sars and mers complain of gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea2 3 coronaviruses can also cause hematochezia in severe cases in infants and neonatescurrently available data show that gastrointestinal involvement in covid19 is relatively infrequent compared with mers and sars among the 1602 patients enrolled in the 10 case series reported 55 had diarrhea average 56 range 23398 and 72 had nausea or vomiting symptoms average 449 range 110 table 11 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 a recent study found that almost half of 99 patients with covid19 showed liver involvement to some degree with variable degrees of elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase although the exact cause remains obscure it may be related to direct liver damage caused by covid19 or antiviral drugs
6

the involvement of the digestive system in covid19 may be underestimated as most patients initially develop respiratory symptoms gastrointestinal symptoms were not recognized or were neglected at the early stage of this epidemic outbreak until the first case was reported in the usa when coronavirus rna was identified in the patients stool sample
8
 during the widespread outbreak due to sudden acute surge in the number of affected patients medical resources and available medical expertise in this area was quickly outstripped by the huge demand for medical attention with the rapidly rising medical need available staff with medical experience were trained to focus mainly on obvious respiratory symptoms and lifethreatening complications in order to isolate these cases quickly gastrointestinal symptoms may be overlooked especially in critically ill patients among the cases reported outside china in the countries such as the usa south korea and vietnam diarrhea was reported as one of the main symptoms this might be attributed to some extent to the adequate numbers of medical personnel for giving detailed care and consultation in covid19 cases even though gastrointestinal symptoms seem to not be prominent it would still be helpful for clinicians to identify these symptoms in the spectrum of this disease and be alert to identifying and preventing the spread of this disease at an early stage with the emerging evidence of the viral rna detected in the feces of patients with diarrhea increased requirements are needed to protect and treat patients with underlying digestive diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease ibd moreover it is necessary to find ways to prevent transmission through the sewage systemthe first confirmed covid19 patient in the usa on january 20 2020 reported nausea and vomiting that had lasted for 2 days on the 2nd day after hospitalization the patient had abdominal discomfort with two bowel movements both the stool and respiratory specimens were tested and found positive for sarscov2 by a realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
8
 this case indicates that the gastrointestinal tract might be involved at least in the colonization of sarscov2 like sarscov with the assistance of transmembrane serine protease tmprss expressed on the host cell membrane sarscov2 uses angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 to mediate entry into cells
13
 a study published online in biorxiv on january 31 2020 analyzed four datasets with single cell transcriptomes of the lung esophagus stomach ileum and colon
14
 the results indicate that ace2 is highly expressed in absorptive intestinal epithelial cells in the ileum and colon as well as in lung cells and esophageal upper and stratified epithelial cells interestingly compared with healthy adults the expression of ace2 is higher in the epithelial cells of the colon of patients with adenomas or colorectal cancer which may predict a higher probability of being infected with sarscov2
15
 one group
16
 also found ace2 played a dual role in mediating sarscov2 infection in the colon after analyzing single cellrna sequencing data from patients with colitis or ibd the results show that ace2 expression is positively associated with a viral attack which is consistent with the abovementioned study regarding the abnormal liver function in patients with sarscov2 mentioned above by adopting singlecell rnasequencing technology from two cohort samples a recent study has shown that ace2 is highly expressed in cholangiocytes rather than the hepatocytes or other interstitial cells therefore during the diagnosis and treatment of patients with sarscov2 clinicians should pay special attention to their liver function
17
 however another study pointed out that ace2 also participated in the prevention of inflammation of the intestine by regulating innate immunity cellular cytotoxicity and energy metabolism figure 1 nevertheless it is necessary for clinicians to note that the digestive system may be invaded by sarscov2 and evolve into an alternative source of infectionalthough there been no solid evidence to confirm that sarscov2 can be transmitted through the fecaloral route this possibility exists as the virus has been successfully isolated in a stool or anal swab of patients with covid19 which is almost as accurate as a pharyngeal swab18 19 moreover sarscov2 was also detected in the stool sample of patients in rehabilitation which stays positive longer than in the swab
20
 fecaloral transmission occurs mainly in areas where there is limited awareness of hygiene or sanitation facilities nevertheless the lesson from the transmission of sars in amoy gardens in hong kong in 2003 resulting from the problem of aging sewage systems should warn us not to ignore biosafety in the disposal of feces from covid19 patients
21
 the five f factors summarizing the main fecaloral route are fingers flies fields fluids and food frequent hand cleansing with sanitizers is the first and most effective step to prevent transmission raising populationwide awareness of hygiene is needed especially in rural areas such as forbidding open defecation and swallowing water from public swimming pools or open areas that are not properly disinfected safe food preparation is also another vital aspect of preventionat registration and during a medical appointment an epidemiological investigation should be conducted and the following information needs to be obtained for both the patient and their companions a travel history in epidemic areas in the previous 2 weeks b any exposure to patients confirmed or suspected of having an sarscov2 infection in the past 2 weeks c any symptoms of sarscov2 infection including but not limited to fever fatigue cough dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms and d the travel history and health of their family members the temperature of the examinee should be measured before the endoscopic examination patients with an unexplained fever or suspected sarscov2 infection should be recommended for isolation for further evaluation it is preferable to reschedule elective endoscopic procedures to after the outbreak of covid19 for emergency endoscopic procedures an algorithm for managing patients with suspected covid19 in the epidemic region is shown in figure 2to reduce the risk of infecting medical staff in the digestive endoscopy unit appropriate protective measures should be taken during the endoscopic procedures protective measures and equipment needed are divided into the following categories the nonepidemic region epidemic region and wards with confirmed patients the corresponding protection methods and equipment requirements are shown in table 2 and figure 3sarscov2 is a serious threat to human health worldwide due to its strong ability for humantohuman transmission in the early days of the disease outbreak medical staff focused on screening for respiratory symptoms however as the disease progresses and understanding unfolds digestive symptoms related to covid19 have also been identified a literature review has shown that the sarscov2 and the sars that broke out in 2003 belong to the same coronavirus family and possess highly similar genomes
24
 in addition the receptors for both sars and sarscov2 is ace2
25
 therefore it is not difficult to understand why sarscov2 may give rise to digestive system symptoms similar to those induced by sarscov a recent case series in china has confirmed that sarscov2 nucleic acid which is negative in throat swabs can still be detected in the feces of three covid19 patients two of whom manifested diarrhea before treatment
26
 nevertheless as it remains unknown whether the virus in the digestive system is derived from cellular fragments from the respiratory system or consists of replicates in the digestive tract it is sensible to take early steps to prevent fecaloral transmission both in the hospital and in the community additional clinical case reports and laboratory studies are needed to confirm the existence of this transmission route more importantly efforts should be made to formulate the clinical protocols and develop antiviral drugs targeting the digestive system in the futureall authors have no conflicts of interest or financial ties to disclosenonesevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is an acute respiratory tract infectious disease induced by sars-cov and mainly transmitted through the short-distance air droplets and close contact its main clinical characteristics is abrupt onset of the disease and the initial symptom is fever accompanied with systematic symptoms of headache soreness and fatigue and respiratory tract symptoms such as cough chest dullness and dyspnea a few cases may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards due to its self-limiting feature the prognosis is predominantly good but may be poor in severe cases with mortality about 93  some patients may develop such complications such as lung fibrosis and necrosis of the head of femur on april 8 2003 sars was defined as a legal infectious disease by the ministry of heath of china
the first sars case was reported around the world on january 2 2003 a hospital in heyuan city of guangdong province hospitalized two patients with severe pulmonary infection of unknown cause which was the first traceable report of sars around the globalon february 28 2003 sars was first diagnosed by the who expert carlor urbani in hanoi of vietnam who also named this new unexplained disease severe acute respiratory syndrome sars
following the emergence of sars who and governments around the world attached great importance and took consecutively effective control and prevention measures which reined in the infection rapidly controlled in a short timeon april 28 2003 who eliminated vietnam from the name list of the sars-infected area which made vietnam the first to get rid of sars outbreaks since then numerous countries were also ticked off the list on july 5 2003 who announced to remove taiwan of china from sars-affected area list which is also the last at present there is no sars-affected area around the world signaling the victory of global battle against sars by the end of september 26 2003 there were in total 8098 people infected and 774 deceased with the mortality at 95 some canadian laboratories excluded influenza virus a and b para-influenza virus type 1 2 and 3 adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus by scanning electron microscopy and direct fluorescent antibody test they also conducted immunohistochemistry on the corpse tissues of dead patients about viruses including influenza virus a and b respiratory syncytial virus adenovirus circovirus hantaan virus measles virus intestinal tract virus and pneumonia mycoplasma and chlamydia which showed negative scholars from german france america hong kong and taiwan applied specific pcr tests targeted at corresponding pathogens to examine pneumonia mycoplasma pneumonia chlamydia human cytomegalovirus circovirus herpes virus human coronavirus oc43 and 229e and arenaviruses bunyavirus hantaan virus crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus which also indicated negativeon march 21 2003 hong kong university firstly separated and cultured coronavirus from the nasopharyngeal specimen of sars patients by vero cells and then several laboratories of canada and america disease center and sars international coordination group also cultured coronavirus on april 16 2003 based on the aforementioned research findings who declared a new coronavirus as the pathogen of sars and named it as sars coronavirus sars-covsars-cov is a single-stranded and positive rna virus belonging to the genus coronavirus of coronaviridae family of nidovirales order it bears great morphological resemblance with known human coronaviruses under the electric microscopes sars coronavirus presents with pleomorphic spherical particles with envelopes in vero e6 cell in vitro and with a diameter of about 80140 mm it has distinct coronavirus morphological characteristics that rodlike surface projections about 2040 nm long protrude outside viral envelope to form a corona for separation and culture of viruses in vero e6 cells viral particles are mostly found in vacuoles inside cells under electric microscope mainly hollow particle and viruses outside cells observed with spikesthe coronavirus is mainly composed of nucleic acid protein carbonate and lipid sars-cov are relatively stable in human specimens and environment but relatively sensitive to chemical and physical factors the viruses could be killed by exposure to ultraviolet rays for 60 min as the envelope of sars-cov contains lipoids they are sensitive to lipid solvents and could be inactivated by ether chloroform tween 70  ethyl alcohol methanol pancreatic enzymes and ultraviolet rays ether could sterilize the virus completely under 4cafter 24 h 75  ethyl alcohol could deactivate virus after 5 min and disinfectants containing chlorine may kill the virus aftsars is the first newly emerging infectious disease in the twenty-first century since the first case was detected in guangdong on january 2 2003 sars spread to 29 countries at five states at an unprecedented speed with several months according to the report of who sars epidemics was found in total 29 countries at five states including hong kong and taiwan of china from january 2 2003 to september 26 2003 since january 2 2003 which infected 8098 patients and caused 774 casualties besides there were 5327 patients in china mainland including 1002 medical workers with 349 deaths 1755 patients in hong kong with 299 deaths 346 patients in taiwan with 37 deaths 251 patients in canada with 43 deaths 238 patients in singapore with 33 deaths 63 patients in vietnam with 5 deaths and 29 patients in america but without casualty meanwhile sars cases were reported in 24 provinces municipalities under direct governance of central government and autonomous regions in china mainland with 2521 infection cases and 183 deaths in beijing and 512 infection cases and 57 deaths in guangdongit is regarded that only symptomatic patients can effectively spread sars-covat present there still lacks clinical proof that asymptomatic sars patients could spread sars coronavirusfew cases are highly contagious and able to directly infect over 10 patients who are called super-spreader the five super-spreaders in singapore have been found infecting 103 people such powerful infectiousness is attributable to the high viral load inside patients who could discharge abundant viruses via respiratory tract in a short timespecialists from the department of microbiology of hong kong university and guangdong provincial disease control and prevention center tested abundant sars coronaviruses from the samples collected from civet cats sold in guangzhou and shenzhen suggesting that the human sars coronavirus might originate from civet catshigh level of sars coronavirus could be detected in the throat swabs and sputum specimens of the patients in acute phase viruses discharged by patients via cough would exist in the air within certain radius thus forming short-distance respiratory tract droplet spread it is a main route of sars disseminationindirect or direct contact spread could also spread sars coronavirus it could be spread through contact with the respiratory tract secretion or through the mouth and nose via contaminated hands and toysas viruses proliferate abundantly in the respiratory tract exfoliated cells containing infectious viruses could be expelled outside the body through patients respiration cough and sneeze and suspend in the air thus forming the aerosol of sars virus cough and sneeze could greatly contribute to production of sars virus aerosolpresent data reveal that sars is an acute self-limiting infectious disease and neutralizing antibodies to sars could be detected 3 weeks after onset however the change patterns of neutralizing antibody titer have not been fully elucidatedthe epidemics of sars mainly take place in the winter and springsars outbreaks are mainly concentrated at coastal tourism cities with prosperous economy dense population and convenient transport particularly air transport from the perspective of international geography sars primarily occurs in southeastern countries or regions including china mainland hong kong taiwan singapore and vietnamanalysis of the statistics of various countries shows that sars onset is mainly recorded in young populations aged 2050 years old occupying around 80  of the totalsars coronavirus sars-cov a mutant of coronaviridae is pathogenic to hosts in the following two aspects firstly viral infections could directly damage the structure and functions of infected cells and trigger cell apoptosis secondly immune reactions and release of various cytokines induced by viral infections could not only eliminate infectious pathogens but also may deal severe damages on histiocytes due to excessive immune reactionsthe member of coronaviridae is a single-chain positive rna virus which taxonomically belongs to nidovirales with arteriviridae the homological analysis of sars-cov structural protein amino-acid sequences shows that the main structural protein s spike protein m membrane protein n nucleocapsid protein and e envelope protein bear very low homology with other known coronaviruses between 20 and 30  besides bioinformation analysis infers that sars-cov may also encode 59 nonstructural proteins of unknown functions all these sars-cov specific proteins may play key roles in determining the viral virulences-protein existent on the viral surface in form of trimer is the main component in constructing the coronal structure and major structural protein for the integration of virus and host cell receptors and fusion of viral envelope and cell membrane to enable invasion of viruses after infection with sensitive cells sars-cov could replicate enormously and release virions which may disturb cell metabolism and directly result in injury of body tissues and cellsin the early phase of the disease and in the continual progression phase the active immune cells such as cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes nk cells and dc cells are decreased prominently to an extent positively correlated with severity of conditions and speed of progression besides all dead patients are detected with irreversible significant decline however along with remission of conditions and entry into recovery phase the number of aforementioned immune cells could be recovered to some extent whose change presents distinct parallel correlation with disease evolution dynamic observations suggest that serum pre-inflammatory cytokine il-6 il-8 il-16 and inf- level of sars patients could reach the peak at about second week of disease course which relatively corresponds to the acute aggravation phase all these consolidate the immune damage of sars-cov infectionslung tissues become swollen and heavier according to domestic report the left lung may reach 5001480 g average 8114 g and right lung 7001125 g average 8693 g with the total lung up to 11702605 g average 14607 g the lung tissues appear in dark red texture is hard indicative of consolidation the surface is relatively smooth and free of pleural adhesions lung tissues are observed with blood vessel dilation and congestion spotted and patchy necrosis and hemorrhagic infarct foci and focal compensatory emphysema sections of various lung lobes are visualized with outflows of light red orand a few foamy blood-stained fluids the trachea and bronchi are found with exudations of slight mucoid or blood-stained secretions pulmonary hilar lymph nodes are revealed with slight enlargement and pleural cavity without or with a few effusionsmicroscopy reveals bilateral diffusive severe injuries of alveoli characterized by acute exudative hemorrhagic and fibrinous inflammation however the injury may be inhomogeneous and diverse at different lung lobes and different parts of the same lobe the characteristic change in early phase is pulmonary edema with homogeneous pink serous or fibrinous effusions filling alveolar cavities as well as erythrocytes leakages in some cavities the effusions from some alveolar cavities may condense to form thin-layer membranelike substance which adheres to alveolar walls namely formation of hyaline membrane fig 21 alveolar epithelia present with such diffusive injuries as degeneration and necrosis with exfoliated orand apoptotic type ii alveolar epithelial cells observable in alveolar cavities which are similar to changes of desquamative pneumonia fig 22 among them some appear like apoptotic bodies partial regional type ii alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages proliferate actively with obvious increase of cell volume and distinct nucleolus in some case cells are detected fusing with each other to form syncytial monocytes and multinucleated giant cells fig 23 the alveolar epithelia of some cases are examined with structures similar to viral inclusion bodies mostly spherical and with eosinophilic staining around which a transparent halo is visible fig 24 pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces are detected with high dilation and congestion of capillaries swelling and exfoliation of epithelial cells as well as widening of the latter which present slight lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration small vessel proliferation and enlargement characteristic of vasculitis changes some regions are observed with pulmonary vascular embolism or fibrinous microthrombi in alveolar capillaries while some alveolar capillary cavities manifest dilation but free of blood components in addition some patients are detected with lung tissue focal hemorrhage compensatory emphysema and small airway necrotizing inflammation and alveolar collapse or shrinkage patients with a disease course of over three weeks manifest fibroblast proliferation in alveolar septa and individual cases demonstrate organization of fibrinous exudates from alveoli and fibroblast proliferation which gives rise to glomeruloid structures named glomeruloid organizing pneumonia fig 25 the bronchial epithelial cells are revealed with exfoliation scarce and exfoliated cilia as well as structures similar to viral inclusions and squamous cell metaplasia at the inside the bronchioli are detected with submucosal edema inflammatory cell infiltration and serous grandular hyperplasia with hyperactive secretion

the patient has a history of intimate contact with patients or is one of the infected populations or consolidated having infected others by definite evidencesthe patient had been to or lived in the areas with sars patients and secondary infection epidemics
the onset is acute and initial symptom is fever with body temperature 38 c and occasionally accompanied by concurrent chillness patients may also suffer from headache joint and muscular soreness fatigue and diarrhea and generally there is no upper respiratory tract catarrhal symptom patients may have cough mostly dry with scanty sputum and chest dullness severe patients demonstrate accelerated respiration shortness of breath or obvious respiratory distress pulmonary signs are not obvious and light moist rales may be audible or pulmonary consolidation observablethere is generally no increase of peripheral white blood cell count or decrease besides the lymphocyte count is found generally declinedlungs present different degrees of patchy and plaque-shaped infiltration shadows or reticulate changes which may progress rapidly into large patchy shadows these commonly occur at multiple lobes or both sides and absorption and dissipation of shadows are relatively slow pulmonary shadows and symptoms and signs may be inconsistent if the test indicates negative reexaminations shall be conducted after 12 daysthere are no remarkable responses to antibioticspatients in compliance with any of the following three circumstances are diagnosed as suspected casesthe patient has a history of intimate contact with patients or is one of the infected population or is confirmed having infecting other people by concrete evidences who also manifest aforementioned clinical symptoms but not high white blood cell count by test of peripheral bloodthe patient has been to or lived in areas reported with infectious sars patients and patients suffering from secondary infections 2 weeks before the disease onset who also have abovementioned clinical symptoms and consistent pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray films with the abovementioned characteristicsdespite the lack of epidemic data the patient has abovementioned clinical manifestations and not high peripheral white blood cell count as well as pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray that accord with abovementioned characteristics
in other words the patient conform to the aforementioned 1 1  2  3 or 1 2 2  4 or 2  3  4in case of any of the three following circumstances the patient could be clinically diagnosed with sarsthe patient has a history of intimate contact with patients or is one of the infected population or is confirmed having infecting other people by concrete evidences who also manifest aforementioned clinical symptoms and pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray imagethe patient has been to or lived in areas reported with infectious sars patients and patients suffering from secondary infections 2 weeks before the disease onset who also have abovementioned clinical symptoms not high peripheral blood white cell count and pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray filmsthe patient has been to or lived in areas reported with infectious sars patients and patients suffering from secondary infections 2 weeks before the disease onset who also have abovementioned clinical symptoms pulmonary shadows on chest x-ray films and no obvious response to anti-infectious treatment

there are still some atypical cases of this diseasethis generally refers to the first 17 days the onset is acute and initial symptom is fever half of the patients are accompanied by the nonspecific systemic symptoms such as chillness headache and joint and muscular sorenessthis phase spans the day 814 of the disease course infectious toxic symptoms such as fever fatigue muscular soreness continue to exist or even aggravate patients body temperature rises possibly to 39 c or higher in a short time and the high fever is persistent lung lesions demonstrate progressive exacerbation a few patients 1015  may develop ards which is life threateningit mostly takes place at day 1521 of disease course most patients have good prognosis after recovery for about 2 weeks some severe patients could gradually recover within 23 months after dischargethese mainly encompass standing chest x-ray and bedside chest x-ray which are economic and effective examination methods and first optional examination for preliminary diagnosis and reexamination mobile x-ray bedside imaging should be applied for patients under observation and inpatients as lung disease of sars patients progress rapidly chest x-ray reexamination within a short period could help observe changes of conditions commonly once every 12 days at the early phase and progression phase regular chest x-ray also need to be conducted during recovery phase so as to ascertain absorption and dissipation of lesions residual foci and pulmonary interstitial fibrosisfor sars patients ct scan generally is not a preferred method and if necessary could be conducted under strict disinfected quarantine if the foci could not be absorbed for a long term in sars recovery phase or patients still have symptoms but normal chest presentations ct scan need to be carried out for further observation as it can better visualize the subtle pulmonary interstitial changes such as lung interlobular septum thickening intralobular septum thickening subpleural linear shadow and small ground-glass-density lesion and regional and segmental bronchiectasis and therefore is helpful for clinical diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis thin-layer ct scan or hrct scan can better visualize intrapulmonary low-density small lesions thus contributory to early diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis ct examination could also aid identification of other concurrent lung lesions
ward shall be equipped with bedside x-ray machine imaging for all sars inpatients shall be conducted in wards and patients shall wear masksthe personal protection for imaging technician should be subject to the level-two protection requirements and when necessary imaging for critically ill patients to level-three protection requirementsx-ray film magazine should be put into the isolation bag before imaging one isolation bag for each personthe imaging technicians should sterilize their hands before return to the radiological department and then remove protective clothing gloves and protective glasses at the designated place they should wash hands thoroughly gargle take a shower and change clean working clothes before work

the department must strengthen interior ventilation and air disinfection  ultraviolet irradiation may be assumed at night 23 times per day 30 minutes per time and peracetic acid spray conducted 2 times per dayrigorous isolation measures all subjects must wear masks the operation staff must wear protective masks gloves and gowns with masks changed every 4 h and gowns replaced in time and should use disposal bed sheet and shoe covers and dispose of and replace them timely after the examinationsars examination zone should be separated from conventional patient examination zone and examination staff shall be fixed if feasible special chest x-ray examination room and x-ray machines may be set up in the isolation zone to avoid cross-infections

the protective measures for subjects and operation staff are similar to those required about isolation protection in radiological departmentall the subjects must wear masks and for examination in ct room shall minimize the stay time as much as possibleafter the patient leaves the environment and articles which may be polluted by patients shall be given terminal disinfectionthe department must enhance interior ventilation and air disinfection and in addition to use of chemical disinfectant spray may also initiate long-term ultraviolet irradiation at night for disinfectiona pathway specific for sars patients should be established
the imaging manifestations of sars are closely related to its pathological changes besides edema inflammatory cell infiltration and other nonspecific inflammatory changes the more prominent pulmonary pathological feature of sars is abundant exfoliation of epithelial cells inducing obvious thickening and damage of alveolar septum as well as significant organization of effusions inside alveolar cavities all the three changes of inflammation in early phase degeneration exudation hyperplasia are observable the mechanism of acute lung injury induced by sars may be ascribed to sars coronavirus direct attack of alveolar epithelia and alveolar capillary epithelia or and indirect damage via lymphocyte macrophage and effector cells and lymphokine cytokine and inflammatory mediator released by them this suggests that besides viral direct infection immune reactions are also involved in lung injuryin severe lung injury pulmonary interstitial and pulmonary parenchymal air cavity changes detected by autopsy pathology especially pulmonary air cavity not completely filled by lesion or filled but coexistent with unfilled alveoli are visualized as ground-glass-density shadows on x-ray and ct varying degrees of residual lung cavity present with different densities of ground-glass shadows on thin-layer ct or high-resolution ct hrct complete filling of the alveolar space leads to pulmonary consolidation shadowsonce pulmonary edema and alveolar hyaline membrane are formed patients clinically manifest decreased lung compliance progressive dyspnea and intractable hypoxemia it is such rapid pathological changes of sars that give rise to characteristic presentations by chest x-ray examination including rapid progression of lesions diverse morphological states and wide range often spanning several segments and lobes therefore dynamic observation of chest image holds great significance for diagnosis of sarsground-glass-density shadows are pathologically the result of lesions mainly at pulmonary interstitium and alveoli with pulmonary interstitial lesions frequently complicated by alveolitis ground-glass-density shadows incurred by alveolar consolidation are attributable to partial filling of alveoli or coexistence of filling and unfilled alveoli such shadows on x-ray and ct can be determined if the density of lesions is lower than that of blood vessels and blood vessel presentations are observable inside the density of lesions lower than that of pulmonary hila on x-ray could also help identify ground-glass-density shadowspulmonary consolidation shadows are pathologically due to filling of alveoli by pathological tissues which is frequently complicated with lung interstitial lesions pulmonary consolidation could be confirmed if the lesions are found with higher density than vascular shadows and without vascular shadows inside but with air bronchogram on x-ray and ct it could also be determined if the lesions present higher density than pulmonary hila or similar density to mediastinum the lesions are solitary or multiple in small patches and some lesions are distributed along lung lobes and segments96  of sars patients may develop subsequently solitary and multiple small patchy shadows within seven days of onset with relatively low density blurry borders and irregular shapes predominantly solitary occasionally the pulmonary textures around lesions are revealed increased and thickened and mainly distributed at peripheral area more commonly at bilateral inferior lungs since chest x-ray can poorly visualize relatively small lesions and at sometimes posteroanterior x-ray can hardly display lesions overlapping with heart shadows orthotopic chest imaging should be conducted at the same time fig 29
the conditions of most patients become worse within 14 days after onset the small patchy shadows in the early phase may progress into large patchy multiple or diffusive lesions the lesions may spread from unilateral lung to both lungs and from one lung field to several fields severe patients may demonstrate obvious changes 12 days after onsetlesions present mainly as ground-glass-density shadows or coexist with lung consolidation shadows the center of some shadows with high density indicates consolidation and relatively low-density peripheral area suggests ground-glass density which may be complicated with thickening and increase of pulmonary textures severe patients may develop white lungsome cases may have pneumothorax pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema after the use of ventilatora small part of lesions adjacent to the pleura may be complicated with local pleural thickening or revealed with mild tentiform adhesion pleural changes may reside after absorption of intrapulmonary lesions complication of slight pleural effusions may also be observable fig 210
the lesions of sars patients begin to be absorbed in 1530 days which can be completely absorbed for majority patients a few patients may show pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary interstitial hyperplasia with apparent pulmonary interstitial hyperplasia occurring 3040 days after the onset the intrapulmonary patchy shadows present with shrinkage and increase of density to gradually form high-density cord-like and honeycomb-shaped shadows in lungs severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could dwindle the lung volume and make the mediastinum shift to the affected side the imaging may reveal local irregular high-density plaque and cord-shaped shadows occurrence of intrapulmonary honeycomb-shaped shadows and tractional bronchiectasis is the characteristic of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis fig 211
as rapid change is an important feature of sars chest x-ray manifestations dynamic x-ray studies and observations could provide evidences for sars definite diagnosis therefore observation of the disease dynamic change is critical to sars chest x-ray which is a major difference from x-ray examinations of other pneumonia in the early phase and progression phase of sars lung foci may undergo remarkable changes within a short time 24 h at the shortest such as expansion and dissemination which are characterized by changes in shape extent and site of the foci this suggests that clinical physicians shall conduct chest orthotopic imaging once every 2448 h after the sars patients are hospitalized so as to ascertain the disease changesimaging dynamic changes are associated with multiple factors such as age original underlying disease treatment method and efficacy the lesions are generally absorbed 14 days after onset but possibly on day 7 in some mild patients the focal shadows may become smaller with the density gradually decreased one characteristic dynamic change of sars is migrating change of lesions in some patients suggesting that the foci firstly occur at the unilateral inferior lung field and then spread to contralateral andor superior and middle lung field patients with worse lesions may manifest wider imaging extent and new foci and severe patients may develop white lung ards is a key cause leading to death of patients fig 212
after sars infection chest abnormal changes frequently occur on day 17 in initial phase focal shadows are frequently seen which might be unilateral but dominantly bilateral ct reveals small patchy ground-glass-density shadows some of which are quasi-circular lesions present as solitary small patchy lung consolidation and multiple small patchy or relatively large patchy shadows large foci may appear as ground-glass-density shadows and concurrent lung consolidation shadows with relatively higher-density vascular shadows observable in the former besides some foci are found with increased vascular shadows at the periphery in addition lesions are unveiled frequently at the bilateral lung inferior fields and lung margins fig 213
lesions in majority patients may progress and worsen within 14 days after onset the small patchy shadows in early phase could expand into large patchy multiple or diffusive lesions within 37 days besides lesions extend from unilateral lung to bilateral lungs from one lung field to multiple lung fields most patients could develop the severest infiltration of lungs on day 814 namely peak phase or critical phase ct presentations are still predominated by ground-glass-density shadows which may be complicated by pulmonary consolidation lesions are commonly multiple and in diffusive distribution at both lungs and lesions of varying shapes may coexist with quasi-circular foci relatively common some cases appear with ground-glass-density shadows all the time from onset to absorption of lesionswhen ground-glass-density shadows are complicated by pulmonary consolidation the large patchy small patchy or quasi-circular ground-glass-density shadows could be observed with pulmonary consolidation shadows of relatively high density ground-glass density and pulmonary consolidation may also occur at different parts of the lung and could be visualized on the same layer or different layers of ct for lesions typical of pulmonary consolidation pulmonary consolidation appears as plaque-shaped high-density shadows or consolidation signs at lung lobes and segments in addition lesions are frequently recorded at lung lobe segment of the inferior lobe and outer band of lung field fig 214
lesions usually begin to be absorbed 23 weeks after onset with the shadow shrunk and density gradually reduced and absorbed although the clinical symptoms of some patients improve and disappear light ground-glass-density shadows could still be seen in lungs on ct it may prolong a relatively long time during the absorption of intrapulmonary lesions there is also concurrent pulmonary interstitial proliferation which begins to be absorbed under dynamic observation some lesions may develop into pulmonary interstitial fibrosis characterized by lobular septum intralobular septum interstitial thickening and subpleural curvature imaging signs as well as regional irregular high-density plaque and cord-like presentations occurrence of intrapulmonary honeycomb manifestations and tractional bronchiectasis signifies pulmonary interstitial fibrosis fig 215
in the early phase sars manifests bronchiolar and peripheral interstitial pneumonia which could further progress into alveolar consolidation with interstitial lesions present persistently and mostly reversible in the recovery phase only some cases develop into pulmonary interstitial proliferation and then cause fibrotic changes pulmonary interstitial proliferation and fibrosis degree and outcome are associated with the extent of pulmonary involvement in peak phase occurrence of complications and treatment generally if lesions on chest image are light in peak phase there will be fewer pulmonary changes left in recovery phase contrarily patients with diffusive lung interstitial thickening in recovery phase are often those suffering from relatively severe pulmonary injury in peak phase and involvement of the great mass of lungs particularly patients with recurrent conditions protracted course and concurrent infections researches demonstrate that 78  of sars patients have pulmonary fibrosis of varying degrees and male patients display relatively more obvious pulmonary impairment than female patients primary manifestations are lung dysfunction such as decrease of pulmonary diffusion capacity lung capacity impairment and change of total lung capacity particularly residual volumegenerally obvious pulmonary interstitial proliferation occurs at about 3050 days after onset which presents firstly lobular septum and intralobular thickening and subpleural curvature shadows then there is the shrinkage of intrapulmonary patchy shadows with increase of density and gradual formation of high-density cord and honeycomb shadows inside lungs severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could diminish lung volume and compel the mediastinum to affected side besides pulmonary interstitial proliferation could occur extensively inside lungs predominated by lobular septum intralobular interstitial thickening and subpleural curvature shadows as well as irregular high-density plaque and cord-like shadows at some regions honeycomb-shaped shadows and tractional bronchiectasis are signs of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis ct reveals cord reticulate and honeycomb-shaped shadows and hrct could better visualize the subtle abnormal changes of pulmonary interstitium such as lobular septum thickening intralobular interstitial thickening subpleural curvature shadows and honeycomb-shaped shadows whether the cord-like and reticulate changes visualized by ct are completely absorbed or induce persistent fibrosis still entails long-term follow-up observation fig 216
numerous sars patients develop osteonecrosis after recovery which mostly appears as femoral head necrosis and also possibly necrosis of the ankle joint knee joint and shoulder joint scans of bilateral hips and knees of 82 sars patients in rehabilitation phase disclosed that 51 patients 62  suffered from osseous abnormality of which bone ischemia accounts for 17  and implication of three sites for 20  its pathogenesis still remains not completely ascertained and it may be ascribed to improper use of hormones and injury of sclerotin from sars viruses bacterial embolism lipid embolism or multiple mixed factors the primary pathological change of aseptic necrosis of femoral head is degenerative alteration due to femoral head blood circulation disturbance mainly characterized by limping and pain the lower limb of the affected side is relatively shorter and presents with light flexion and adduction as well as with slightly limited abduction and intorsioninitial x-ray examinations suggest that the involved femoral head has normal appearance but inhomogeneous density with spotted osteoporosis gradually ensue the increase of density as a result of osteonecrosis which meanwhile is interspersed with some transparent shadows femoral head may become flat fragmented and irregular in contour from pressures typical femoral head necrosis appears in the shape of wedge with the base toward articular surface and the top toward metaphysis since lesions are dominantly confined at the anterosuperior area of femoral head lateral imaging of hip joints could clearly reproduce the extent of lesions the necrotic area is encircled by a ring of transparent band hip articular cavity may become wider and irregular due to flattening of the femur sometimes there may be complication of dislocation the fragments of femoral head may be shed off into the joint giving rise to joint mousenormal femoral head is located at the acetabular center in the transverse ct image and may appear in the shape of sphere or hook on different layers with delicate high-density bone cortex at the periphery the high-density trabeculae inside femoral head are arranged in stelliform formation from the center continually to bone cortex named as stelliform sign ct manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head can be divided into early and advanced phase in the early phase the stelliform sign formed by the trabeculae of femoral head is deformed or absent presenting spotted and patchy shadows of increased density inside femoral head and fasciculate changes or mutual fusion at its periphery in the advanced phase femoral head become ruptured and out of shape and absorption of sclerotin between bone fragments appears as irregular low-density area with stelliform sign disappearedmri manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head include necrotic areas of femoral head of early cases have no repair reactions or mechanic collapse and still maintain normal lipid signals of medullary bones however low-signal margins incurred by sclerosis reactions could be seen at the periphery of foci the t1 high signals of normal femoral head on t1-weighted image are detected with black linear low signals representing demarcation between normal and ischemic bone tissues on t2-weighted image a high-signal line is visible at the medial low-signal sclerotic reaction line thus forming the typical double-line sign the double-line sign could reflect congestion and inflammation of granulation tissues and proves specific to aseptic necrosis of femoral head severe inflammation congestion fibrosis and sclerosis could greatly deplete the amount of lipids of femoral head which presents liquid-like signals on mri low signals on t1-weighted image and high signals on t2-weighted images advanced cases are typical of fibrosis and sclerosis and the affected area present with fibrotic mri features that is low signals on t1- and t2-weighted and proton density-weighted imaging complication with effusions in hip joints appears as t1 low signals and t2 high signalsbased on mri presentations aseptic necrosis of femoral head could be classified into four phases phase i is characterized by homogenous or inhomogeneous low-signal areas adjacent to the joint above the femoral head on t1-weighted imaging phase ii is visualized with wedge-shaped low-signal bands phase iii presents with sequestrum crescent sign and cortex collapse phase iv manifests joint degeneration and joint space narrowing besides presentations of phase iii in light of the aforementioned mr staging criteria sars cases complicated by aseptic necrosis of femoral head already reported are mostly in phase iiadditionally aseptic necrosis after use of hormones besides most frequently involvement of the femoral head could also implicate other joints such as the knee joint elbow joint ankle joint and acetabulum therefore if necessary mr examinations of other joints shall be conducted to ascertain the extent and degree of lesions if sars patients complain of pain at both hip joints and limited movement ct scan or mri examination of both hip joints is recommended to conclude definite diagnosis x-ray plain scan is not sensitive to early bone ischemic necrosis which therefore is not preferred fig 217 and 218

since december 2019 an epidemic caused by novel coronavirus 2019-ncov infection has occurred unexpectedly in china at present 2019-ncov infection has been a legal class b infectious disease of the law of the peoples republic of china on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and managed as a class a infectious disease for infection prevention and control practicesas of 8 pm 31 january more than 20 pediatric cases have been reported in china of these cases ten were identified in zhejiang province with an age of onset ranging from 112 days to 17 years following latest national recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections caused by 2019-ncov the 4th edition and current status of clinical practice in zhejiang province recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection caused by 2019-ncov for children were drafted out by the national clinical research center for child health national childrens regional medical center childrens hospital zhejiang university school of medicine to further standardize the protocol of respiratory infection in children caused by 2019-ncov2019-ncov is a novel human coronavirus in addition to coronavirus 229e nl63 oc43 hku1 middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mersr-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov 2019-ncov is enveloped single-stranded plus stranded rna virus with a diameter of 60140 nm spherical or elliptical in shape and pleomorphic 1 it has been reported that the consistency of whole genome-wide nucleotide sequences of 2019-ncov with sars-like coronavirus in bats bat-sl-covzc45 ranges from 869 1 to 89 2 the nucleotide sequence of spines protein on the envelope of the virus is also highly consistent with that of bat-sl-covzc45 84 and sars-cov 78the physicochemical property of 2019-ncov has not been clarified clearly yet it is thought that 2019-ncov is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heating for example according to researches on sars-cov and mers-cov the virus can be inactivated by heating at 56 c for 30 minutes and by using lipid solvents such as 75 ethanol chlorine-containing disinfectant peroxyacetic acid and chloroform but not by chlorhexidine according to the researches on sars-cov and mers-covthe main sources of the infection are patients infected by 2019-ncov with or without clinical symptoms 2 in addition patients in the incubation period may also have potency to transmit the virus based on the case evidencethe novel virus is spread through respiratory droplets when patients cough talk loudly or sneeze close contact is also a source of transmission eg contact with the mouth nose or eye conjunctiva through contaminated hand whether transmission can occur through motherinfant vertically or breast milk has not been established yetthere are general susceptibilities in all groups with the elderly and people with basic diseases more likely to become severe cases children may have mild clinical symptoms after infection 3the incubation period of 2019-ncov infections ranges from 2 to 14 days though most often rangs from 3 to 7 days 3at the onset of the disease infected children mainly present with fever fatigue and cough which may be accompanied by nasal congestion runny nose expectoration diarrhea headache etc most of the children had low to moderate fever even no fever dyspnea cyanosis and other symptoms can occur as the condition progresses usually after 1 week of the disease accompanied by systemic toxic symptoms such as malaise or restlessness poor feeding bad appetite and less activity the condition of some children may progress rapidly and may develop into respiratory failure that cannot be corrected by conventional oxygen nasal catheter mask within 13 days in these severe cases even septic shock metabolic acidosis and irreversible bleeding and coagulation dysfunction may occurrapid respiration rate and moist rales on auscultation usually indicate pneumonia the criteria for rapid respiratory rate are as follows  60 timesmin for less than 2 months old  50 timesmin for 212 months old  40 timesmin for 15 years old  30 timesmin for  5 years old after ruling out the effects of fever and crying with the aggravation of the disease respiratory distress nasal flaring suprasternal intercostal and subcostal retractions grunting and cyanosis may occurmaternal hypoxemia caused by severe infection can lead to intrauterine asphyxia premature delivery and other risks neonates especially preterm infants who are more likely to present with insidious and non-specific symptoms need more close observationaccording to the current conditions of the reported cases the children mainly belong to family cluster cases most of them have good prognosis and in mild cases recover 12 weeks after disease onset no deaths in children have been reported up to nowroutine blood test white blood cell count is usually normal or reduced with decreased lymphocyte count progressive lymphocytopenia in severe casesc-reactive protein crp normal or increasedprocalcitonin pct normal in most cases the level of pct  05 ngml indicates the co-infection with bacteriaothers elevation of liver enzymes muscle enzymes and myoglobin and increased level of d-dimer might be seen in severe casesnucleic acid testing is the main method of laboratory diagnosis 2019-ncov nucleic acid can be detected by rt-pcr or by viral gene sequencing of throat swabs sputum stool or blood samplesother methods 2019-ncov particles can be isolated from human respiratory epithelial cells through virus culture 4 5 but this experiment cannot be carried out in general laboratories virus antigen or serological antibody testing kits are not available at presentchest x-ray examination in the early stage of pneumonia cases chest images show multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes 4 remarkable in the lung periphery 2 severe cases can further develop to bilateral multiple ground-glass opacity infiltrating shadows and pulmonary consolidation with infrequent pleural effusionchest ct scan pulmonary lesions are shown more clearly by ct including ground-glass opacity and segmental consolidation in bilateral lungs especially in the lung periphery in children with severe infection multiple lobar lesions may be present in both lungs
children with a travel or residence history in wuhan city and neighboring areas or other areas with persistent local transmission within 14 days prior to disease onsetchildren with a history of contacting patients with fever or respiratory symptoms who have a travel or residence history in wuhan city and neighboring areas or in other areas with persistent local transmission within 14 days prior to disease onsetchildren with a history of contacting confirmed or suspected cases infected with 2019-ncov within 14 days prior to disease onsetchildren who are related with a cluster outbreak in addition to this patient there are other patients with fever or respiratory symptoms including suspected or confirmed cases infected with 2019-ncovnewborns delivered by suspected or confirmed 2019-ncov-infected mothers

stool or blood samples being highly homologous with the known 2019-ncov2019-ncov granules being isolated by culture from throat swab sputum stool or blood samplesit is necessary to strengthen the awareness of the early identification of the disease in clinic screening was conducted mainly according to the epidemiological history and fever or respiratory symptoms and pathogen examination should be carried out on time furthermore effective isolation measures and appropriate treatment need to be provided promptly even if the common respiratory pathogen tests are positive children who have a history of close contact with 2019-ncov-infected cases also are recommended for timely 2019-ncov pathogen testingthis type of patient includes those with asymptomatic infection upper respiratory

and rhabdomyolysisdisease progresses rapidly along with organ failure with any of the following conditionsrespiratory failure which requires mechanical ventilation patients present with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and are featured by refractory hypoxemia which cannot be alleviated by conventional oxygen therapy such as nasal catheter or mask oxygen supplementseptic shock in addition to severe pulmonary infection 2019-ncov can cause damage and dysfunction of other organs when dysfunction of extrapulmonary system such as circulation blood and digestive system occurs the possibility of sepsis and septic shock should be considered and the mortality rate increases significantlyaccompanied by other organ failure that needs icu monitoring and treatmentviruses such as sars virus influenza virus parainfluenza virus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus can cause viral respiratory infections patients commonly present with fever cough and dyspnea and interstitial pneumonia in some cases most of the cases have normal or decreased white blood cell counts while severely infected children show reduced level of lymphocyte count similar to 2019-ncov all of these viruses can transmit through respiratory tract or direct contact which is characterized by clustering onset epidemiological exposure history plays an important role in differential diagnosis which is mainly confirmed by laboratory examinationspatients with bacterial pneumonia mostly display high fever and toxic appearance in the early stage of the disease cough is not obvious but moist rale can be heard chest image may show small patchy shadows or segmental or even lobar consolidation blood routine examination shows increased white blood cell count with neutrophil predominating as well as elevated crp noninvasive pneumonia is usually accompanied by obvious cough antibiotics are effective blood or deep sputum culture is helpful for diagnosis of bacterial pneumoniamycoplasmal pneumonia may occur in any season and in schools and child-care institutions with small epidemic patients are predominantly school-age children but the number of younger children is increasing they usually start with high fever and cough chest images may reveal manifestations including reticular shadows and small patchy or large consolidation blood routine examination shows that the white blood cell count is normal or increased and crp is slightly elevated nucleic acid detection of airway secretion and serum mycoplasma-specific igm determination are helpful for differential diagnosisit should be noted that patients with 2019-ncov infection can have co-infection or superimposed infection with other viruses or bacteria simultaneouslythe four principles of early identification early isolation early diagnosis and early treatment should be emphasizedmedical isolation is supposed to be carried out once the suspected cases are identified the confirmed cases should be admitted to the designated hospitalsavoid using broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroidsantibiotics corticosteroids bronchoalveolar lavage mechanical ventilation and other more invasive intervention such as blood purification and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation emco should be applied cautiously based on costbenefit evaluationmonitoring patients conditions closely and adjusting the therapeutic protocols timely through multidisciplinary cooperation are of great significancesuspected case should be isolated in a single room while confirmed cases can be arranged in the same roomduring the course of treatment pay close attention to the changes in childrens conditions regularly monitor vital signs spo2 etc and identify the severe and critical cases as early as possiblethe general strategies include bed rest and supportive treatments ensuring sufficient calorie and water intake maintaining water electrolyte balance and homeostasis and strengthening psychotherapy for elder children when necessarythere are no effective antiviral drugs for children at present interferon-2b nebulization can be applied and the recommended usage is as followsinterferon-2b nebulization

oxygenation which cannot be reversed by conservative treatmentsin case of circulation dysfunction vasoactive drugs should be used to improve microcirculation on the basis of adequate liquid support 3 patients with acute renal injury should be given continuous blood purification on time in the meantime paying attention to the brain function monitoring if neccessary if intracranial hypertension and

in december 2019 a local cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology was observed subsequently similar cases were observed nationally on january 7 2020 the virus strain causing pneumonia was successfully isolated by researchers 12 this virus is genetically related to the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov outbreak in 2003 3 consequently the new virus was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses on february 11 on the same day the world health organization who proclaimed the official name of the disease caused by the new virus as coronavirus disease covid-19 4as covid-19 continued to spread and developed into an epidemic the who declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern 5 as of march 9 there were 80754 confirmed cases reported in china 6 of which 1272 cases were in the henan province 7 a study by zhou et al reported the risk factors for mortality of covid-19 inpatients in wuhan 8 but the thresholds for each risk factor was not given to our knowledge there have been no studies to predict patients with severe covid-19 from the results of their first visitthe objective of this study was to determine the risk factors for severe covid-19 based on the test results from the patients first visit and describe the clinical features in patients with severe covid-19our study population consisted of confirmed covid-19 patients who were either discharged or died prior to february 15 2020 our study was launched on march 1 2020 participants with the following missing information were excluded from the study age date of first symptom contact date or examination data all demographic and clinical information was collected retrospectively from the electronic medical records emrpatients who underwent at least one of the following procedures were assigned to the severe group continuous renal replacement therapy crrt high flow oxygen absorption noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo the remaining participants were assigned to the non-severe groupdata obtained from the emr included age sex contact history latest contact date primary symptoms and date of occurrence comorbidities and the results of routine blood tests as well as liver function kidney function c-reactive protein crp and procalcitonin tests from the initial visit confidentiality of information was maintained by removing personal identifiable information the medical research ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital of zhenghzou university approved this studythe following comorbidities were noted among our participants respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd asthma and interstitial pneumonia metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease cvd such as hypertension and coronary heart disease and neurological diseases such as cerebral hemorrhage and infarctiona clustered onset was defined as two or more cases with fever or respiratory symptoms in a confined area such as a home office school class or similar setting within the previous two weeks the incubation period was defined as the time between the date of occurrence of primary symptoms and latest contact date with known infected individualsdata from the emr were entered using epidata and confirmed twice every case was entered independently by two different data entry clerks and consistency was verified by a supervisor three members of our research group were responsible for reviewing each data entry for which conflicting data had been entered the doi link is dxdoiorg1017504protocolsiobfpejmjeall data were entered and managed in epidata spss 190 was utilized for cleaning and analyzing the data as the quantitative data did not follow a normal distribution the data were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges iqrs after applying the mann-whitney u test for comparison between the groups qualitative data were expressed using counts and percentages and compared using the chi-squared or fishers exact test thresholds were calculated using receiver operating characteristic roc curves independent effects were shown using multivariate logistic regression based on the univariate analysis results and clinical experience five variables were chosen for the multivariable analysis including age comorbidity lymphocyte count crp levels and procalcitonin levels the significance level was set at 005in the henan province there were a total of 410 confirmed covid-19 patients with a final outcome of discharge or death prior to february 15 after excluding cases with missing values 74 participants were assigned to then on-severe group and 30 participants were assigned to the severe groupthe median age of the study participants was 420iqr  310550 years ranging from 5 to 85 years there were 63 male patients accounting for 606 of all participants and 41 female patients accounting for 394 of all participants of the 104 participants 84 808 had a history of traveling or residing in either wuhan or the surrounding areas or other communities with reported covid-19 cases while 38 participants 365 had contact with individuals who were experiencing fever or respiratory symptoms and had recently been to wuhan or its surrounding areas or other communities with reported cases furthermore 17 163 patients had a clustered onset 24 231 had a history of contact with a covid-19 patient and 6 58 had an unknown history of exposure the median incubation period for the entire group was 50 iqr  3090 days ranging from1 days to14 day an incubation period of less than 7 days was observed in 705 of the patients further 29 279 participants had underlying diseases with cardiovascular disease being the most common underlying disease followed by metabolic and respiratory disease the main symptoms of the participants included fever cough and fatigue fever was the most common initial symptom manifesting in 79 patients 760 on admission table 1the median age in the non-severe group 55 years was significantly higher than in the severe group 40 years underlying diseases manifested in 13 433 patients in the severe group which was higher than in the non-severe group and the difference was statistically significant p005 the proportion of patients with cardiovascular disease was also greater in the severe group than in the non-severe group and the difference was statistically significant p 005 with regard to symptoms the proportion of patients with dyspnea was significantly higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group p 005 the proportions of patients with fever cough asthma and chest distress were greater in the severe group however these differences were not significant other symptoms demonstrated no quantifiable difference between the severe and non-severe groups table 1the majority of factors examined at first admission indicated a non-significant difference between the two groups however direct bilirubin lactate dehydrogenase crp and procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group p 005 additionally the absolute value of lymphocyte count was also significantly lower in the severe group than in the non-severe group p 005 as shown in table 2as demonstrated by the roc curves using a single predictor age the absolute lymphocyte value crp and procalcitonin are valuable predictors for detecting severe conditions in patients the area under the curve auc for these predictors were 0676 0708 0734 and 0773 respectively further the thresholds for these factors were 63 for age 102109l for lymphocyte 6508mgl for crp and 012gl for procalcitonin figs 14 and table 3the results of the multivariate logistic regression indicate that age lymphocyte and crp are independent predictors for an increased risk of severe covid-19 patients who are at least 63 years old with an absolute lymphocyte value less than 102109l and a crp greater than 6508 mgl are at greater risk of developing severe covid-19 with corresponding odds ratios of 410 61 and 89 respectively table 4 an analysis of the roc curves with multiple predictors is shown in fig 5 these results have a high degree of accuracy as implied by an auc of 0858 95ci  0754 0962our study indicates that age the absolute lymphocyte count at initial visit and crp may be used as predictors during the early stage of diagnosis in patients who are at risk of developing severe covid-19 in many severe cases patients have cvd as a comorbidity dyspnea and higher concentrations of direct bilirubin lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitoninin our study the median age of the 104 participants was 420 years iqr  310550 ranging from 5 to 85 years of age in addition for 705 of the patient the incubation period was less than seven days which indicates that covid-19 has a short incubation period and may impact both children and adults the same result shave been reported in previous studies 9 the median age in the severe group was 550 years iqr  310720 which is higher than the median age in the non-severe group median  400 iqr  320550 the threshold for age was 63 years as indicated in the roc curve analysis the threshold age is a predictor for an increased risk of severe covid-19 in addition our multivariate logistic regression analysis implied that patients who are older than 63 years are at higher risk of developing severe covid-19 or 410 the trends indicated in our study are similar to those indicated in previous studies 10 moreover studies show that immune responses in older adults are slower less coordinated and less efficient rendering older adults more susceptible to emerging infections 11 a study by shahid et al indicates that the probability of having multiple comorbidities increased the risk of mortality from sars-cov-2 in older adults 12our data indicate that 279 of patients had an underlying disease especially cardiovascular and metabolic disorders the percentage of patients suffering from cvd was higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group these results have been verified by epidemic reports from the chinese center for disease control and prevention 13 as in previous studies the principal symptoms of covid-19 are respiratory symptoms some patients also suffer significant cardiovascular damage from covid-19 coupled with underlying cvd these complications may increase the risk of death for some patients covid-19 results from a spike protein in the virus binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is highly expressed in the heart and lung tissue a contributing factor to severe covid-19 in patient with cvd may be the increased concentration of ace2 in these patients as the middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov may result in acute myocarditis and heart failure acute coronary syndrome patients infected with the novel coronavirus are at an increased risk of cardiac insufficiency that might lead to severe covid-19 or death 14the most common symptoms of covid-19 in our study were fever 923 cough 635 and fatigue 481 some patients also experienced dizziness 87 a runny nose 87 nasal obstruction 67 and diarrhea 67 these numbers are similar to those described in previous studies 1516 our study indicates that in 760 of the patients the initial symptom was fever in addition 923 of the patients had fever during the inpatient period of those all patients with severe covid-19 had fever as shown in previous studies although only 438 of the patients had fever on admission 887 of all patients had fever during hospitalization 17 this implies that fever did not present as an initial symptom in all covid-19 patients nonetheless fever occurred as pneumonia symptoms developed fever that developed as a result of critical pulmonary infection was frequently observed in patients with severe covid-19 therefore temperature monitoring should not be the only screening measure for covid-19 we suggest that in addition to temperature monitoring the patients contact history and symptoms should be examined to identify individuals who require observation a higher number of patients showed signs of dyspnea in the severe group than in the non-severe group in our study indicating that dyspnea was one of the main symptoms among patients with severe covid-19 thus a daily evaluation for dyspnea should be conducted among covid-19 patients wang et al suggest that more frequent chest ct scans should be performed for patients with severe dyspnea to understand the changes and indications in pulmonary imaging 18all cases in our covid-19 study had a decreased lymphocyte count on admission patients in the severe group had even lower absolute lymphocyte values as indicated by a median of 091 iqr  05911109l similar changes in the lymphocyte counts were observed in patients with sars 1920 a previous study regarding lymphocyte subsets indicated that covid-19 patients had reduced count of total lymphocytes cd4 t cells cd8 t cells b cells and natural killer cells furthermore severe covid-19 cases had lower counts than non-severe cases 21 a study by qin et al suggests that covid-19 might damage lymphocytes especially t lymphocytes consequently the immune system is impaired during the course of the disease 22the coefficients from our multivariate regression analysis indicated that patients with an absolute lymphocyte value of 102109l have an increased risk of experiencing severe covid-19 or  61 this implies that a decrease in the lymphocyte count should be a key predictor in the early diagnosis of severe covid-19 research on sars has shown similar results a decrease in the lymphocyte count could be an early warning of severe disease 2324this study indicates that patients with elevated concentrations of serum crp on admission are at an increased risk of experiencing severe covid-19 the risk of developing severe covid-19 in patients with a serum crp of 6508 mgl is 89 times than in patients with a serum crp6508 mgl at elevated concentrations crp which is an acute-phase protein is correlated with an increased risk of organ failure and death for patients admitted to the icu further prolonged periods of high crp concentrations are associated with adverse outcomes 25 previous research in wuhan indicated that increased levels of crp were indicative of a sustained inflammatory response subsequent to infection with sars-cov-2 additionally patients with severe covid-19 had more prominent inflammation 26 similar trends of elevated serum crp were also found in sars patients 27 a previous study shows that a crp concentration of  475mgl is correlated with an increased risk of death for sars patients or  58 28our study has several limitations first due to the limited ability to collect data and the relatively low morbidity and mortality of covid 19 the sample size in this study is small which resulted in relatively few variables being included in the multivariate analysis it is possible that some significant variables may have been neglected second as this study is a retrospective study the data collected from the electronic medical records are limited thus data about additional significant factors may have not been available for example we were unable to analyze the possible causes of higher procalcitonin levels because we lacked data on bacterial infectionsin this study we summarized the clinical features of covid-19 patients and identified the early warning signs of severe covid-19 which will help physicians determine which patients require further observation although this study has some limitations including a small sample size few variables included in the multivariate analysis a retrospective cohort design and limited data collected from medical records the results of our study indicate that older age a decreased lymphocyte count on admission and an increased concentration of serum crp could serve as early warning signs in patients who are at risk of developing severe covid-19 consequently we suggest that patients with these clinical characteristics be monitored closely further studies should be conducted to confirm the results of our studythe emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov zaki et al 2012 has placed a large burden on the healthcare systems of several countries in particular those where outbreaks have occurred drosten et al 2015 kim and lee 2015 according to the saudi ministry of health 1579 mers-cov cases had been reported across the kingdom of saudi arabia up until april 25 2017 with 660 deaths related to mers-cov saudi ministry of health 2017 the mortality rate has been high das et al 2015 al-dorzi et al 2016 al-hameed et al 2016 kim et al 2016a sherbini et al 2017 particularly in patients with symptoms sherbini et al 2017despite the fact that most cases experience early mers-related signs and symptoms al-dorzi et al 2016 sherbini et al 2017 assiri et al 2013a a considerable number of cases are diagnosed only when the illness becomes more severe al-dorzi et al 2016 rivers et al 2016 banik et al 2016 a saudi arabian study included mers patients diagnosed between 2012 and july 2015 documenting that one-third of the cases reported their symptoms after 7 days alsahafi and cheng 2016 according to the authors no association was found between the long time interval before reporting symptoms and patient outcomes however their findings were based on the time interval between symptom onset and hospital admission rather than diagnosispark et al investigated the diagnostic accuracy of serological assays in a sample of 17 patients with confirmed mers-cov infection at different time intervals after the onset of illness park et al 2015 the study reported that the serological assays were highly sensitive at 21 days following the onset of illness park et al 2015kim et al investigated the clinical progression and cytokine profiles after the first appearance of illness in a korean population with mers-cov kim et al 2016b their study reported that the time interval was associated with a poor outcome in patients with severe illness the median time interval from symptom onset to transfer to the isolation unit was reported to be 5 days with a range of 211 days kim et al 2016b more studies are warranted to investigate the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis and the factors associated with this interval in other mers populations specifically in saudi arabia where mers-cov was first reported and where the worlds largest outbreaks occurseveral studies have reported that people might not be able to identify mers symptoms the transmission cycle banik et al 2015 malik et al 2016 and its etiology malik et al 2016 due to the complexity of the disease during the circulation of mers-cov in the past 5 years the time interval between symptom onset and diagnosis has remained poorly understood in these patients no research has addressed the factors associated with the time to a confirmed mers diagnosis after symptom onset in saudi arabiathe early identification of mers-related signs and symptoms could result in early diagnosis and thus provide medical support to help mitigate the symptoms and improve the prognosis of patients early diagnosis may reduce the spread of the illness to people who are in close contact with the cases zumla et al 2015the hypothesis of this study was that the time interval between symptom onset and the diagnosis of mers may differ by age group sex region severity of illness source of infection and other factors the study aimed to estimate the median time interval to a confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset and to identify potential predictors of this time interval in saudi arabian mers patientsthe statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss 240 ibm corp armonk ny usa the characteristics of the study population were summarized using the frequency and percentage  for categorical variables and the mean and standard deviation sd or median and interquartile range iqr when necessary for numerical variables the study outcome modeled was the time interval from symptom onset to a confirmed diagnosis the author investigated multivariate count models using poisson regression and negative binomial models initially over-dispersion was assessed and the adequacy of negative binomial and poisson regression models was checked the log likelihood and the deviance goodness-of-fit were calculated for each model and compared it was found that the negative binomial model outperformed the poisson regression model the negative binomial model was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios rr and arr and to identify predictors of the time interval to confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset the rr was used to assess the strength of the association between the predictor and the time interval of confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset if the rr was 1 it was considered that the predictor increased the time interval to confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset if the rr was 1 it was considered that the predictor reduced the time interval to confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset a p-value of 005 was considered statistically significanta total of 537 mers patient records were retrieved and included in the study the mean age of these patients was 55  179 years range 1109 years and 414 of patients were aged above 60 years two-thirds of patients were male 739 had a comorbidity 104 were

with the negative binomial regression modelthis study appears to be the first to estimate the time interval between symptom onset and a confirmed diagnosis and to identify the potential predictors of this time interval in symptomatic cases of mers-cov infection in saudi arabia the average time interval to a confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset was 56 days median 4 days kim et al reported a similar median estimate 5 days in a sample of mers patients in the republic of korea kim et al 2016bthe results of the present study are consistent with those of a saudi arabian study using saudi ministry of health public data on mers cases reported between september 2012 and september 2015 in which it was estimated that the mean time from symptom onset to confirmation was 660 days and the mean time from symptom onset to notification was 530 days alhamlan et al 2017 the median time from symptom onset to confirmation was not reported in that studyin this study it was possible to estimate the unadjusted rr by the characteristics of the patients and the disease it was found that older age 65 years was significantly associated with a prolonged time interval to reporting mers-related symptoms the rr of delayed diagnosis was 42 higher in patients over the age of 65 years compared to the youngest age group of patients 30 years this might explain the high mortality rate observed in this age group rivers et al 2016 banik et al 2015 assiri et al 2013bnon-healthcare workers had a higher rate of a prolonged time interval in reporting mers-related symptoms than healthcare workers rr 174 95 confidence interval 12712380 this may be attributed to several factors 1 access to healthcare facilities could be an issue for non-healthcare workers and thus warrants further investigation 2 the symptoms of mers may not be clearly obvious to non-healthcare workers as there are gaps in knowledge about the virus and symptoms in this group assiri et al 2013b alqahtani et al 2017 an interventional study may target the level of knowledge in the non-healthcare worker group to improve their understanding of the virus and symptoms and the importance of the early notification of symptomsthe finding of the current study that the severity of illness is associated with a prolonged time interval between onset and diagnosis is consistent with the study by kim et al 2016b the estimated time interval between onset and diagnosis in patients with severe illness was 619 days while it was 506 days in patients with a stable condition this seems to be an important finding that could justify early symptom notification which could be addressed through a public health education campaign to mitigate and control mers-cov in its early stagesthe uniqueness of this work lies in the investigation of the association between the time interval from onset to diagnosis and the source of infection in symptomatic cases of mers-cov infection in saudi arabia it was found that the time interval from onset to diagnosis was independently associated with the source of infection those who had an unknown source of infection and those who had been in contact with camels had a 68 and 58 respectively higher risk of a delay in seeking diagnosis or medical support compared to those who had household-acquired infections these findings have not previously been reported elsewhere a lack of knowledge about the primary source of the virus and recognition of mers-cov symptoms could be barriers to early presentation and identification of the virusa saudi arabian study measured awareness of mers-cov in a sample of twitter users in saudi arabia al-mohrej et al 2016 more than half 53 of these twitter users were unaware that camels and bats are the primary source of the virus al-mohrej et al 2016 the study recommended that individuals in close contact with camels should be targeted in future mers-cov education campaigns these individuals need to be aware that they are at increased risk of mers-cov this could help to screen for mers-cov early and limit the spread of the virus furthermore detailed investigations should be performed in patients with an unknown source of infection any exposure needs to be considered and documented as a possible source of infection the decreased risk of a delay in seeking diagnosis in patients with household-acquired infections could be due to the case definition of mers-cov as per the saudi ministry of health the case definition of mers-cov includes whether there has been close contact with a confirmed or probable case of mers-cov infection al-mohrej et al reported that 74 of their sample knew that the mers-cov infection is transmitted via close contact al-mohrej et al 2016this study has some limitations the study used public source data in which details of the patients clinical characteristics had not been reported the results should be interpreted with caution as the findings reflect association but not causation despite several limitations the findings highlight valuable information on the predictors of a delay in seeking diagnosis or medical support in symptomatic cases of mers-cov infection in saudi arabia the study highlights the importance of early notification of symptoms related to mers-cov as a delay in diagnosis could contribute to a worse clinical outcome and to the mers burden in saudi arabia and worldwidein conclusion the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was greater in older patients non-healthcare workers patients with severe illness patients with an unknown source of infection and patients in close contact with camels the delay in diagnosis could explain the worse clinical outcomes in symptomatic cases of mers-cov infection the findings warrant educational interventions to raise general public awareness of the importance of early symptom notificationnonei declare that i have no competing interestbeginning in december 2019 a series of patients with acute respiratory disease were presented to health practitioners in wuhan hubei province china the chinese centers for disease control and prevention immediately launched the pneumonia of unknown etiology mechanism on the 7th of january 2020 a novel coronavirus named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was isolated from a patient samples and officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee for taxonomy of virus on the 11th of february 2020 1 sars-cov-2 is a  coronavirus its genetic signatures differ significantly from those of human severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sarsr-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mersr-cov 2on the 22nd of january 2020 the national health commission listed novel coronavirus pneumonia as a class b infectious disease as stipulated in the law of the peoples republic of china on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and they instituted prevention and control measures for class a infectious diseases wuhan is a transportation hub in central china thus infection with sars-cov-2 spread quickly to other chinese cities and many countries worldwide on the 30th of january 2020 the world health organization who declared this coronavirus outbreak as an international public health emergency as of the 24th of february 2020 there were 77779 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease covid-19 with 2666 deaths worldwide the prospects for preventing an epidemic were grim by this time the number of infections had far exceeded sars and mers and sars-cov-2 appeared to be more contagious the estimated r0 being 22 3the average incubation periods of sars and mers are 40 and 55 days respectively in the early stages of the covid-19 outbreak experts used these data for sars and mers as a reference and estimated the incubation period for covid-19 to be 214 days 4 5 however zhong et al reported a patient whose reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr result became positive on the 24th day after known contact 6 furthermore 980 patients diagnoses were unconfirmed until their third nucleic acid test 7 thus the optimal duration of isolation is still unknown the typical chest computed tomography ct imaging features of covid-19 pneumonia are multiple patchy ground glass opacities in multiple lobules bilaterally with a peripheral distribution 8 the imaging findings are normal in some patients with early stage infection pulmonary abnormalities developing as the disease progresses 9 however the rate of imaging changes in the lungs and the risk of lesions in each lobe are unclear compared with the cases in hubei province affected patients outside hubei china have exhibited mild or moderate symptoms there are few published studies on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and chest imaging findings of patients infected with covid-19 especially in areas outside hubei province we therefore performed this retrospective study to provide more data about covid-19 including the timeline for clinical symptoms and virological conversion and chest radiological abnormalitiesthis study was approved by the institutional review board of the fifth affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university zhuhai china no zdwy 2020 lunzi no k22-1 the need for consent was waived given the observational and retrospective nature of the studywe retrospectively analyzed data of 87 patients with covid-19 hospitalized in the fifth hospital of sun yat-sen university zhuhai china from the 17th of january to the 24th of february 2020 we diagnosed covid-19 in accordance with the criteria in the who interim guidelines and the diagnosis and treatment plan for novel coronavirus pneumonia by the national health commission fifth trial version a confirmed case was defined as a positive result for throat swab specimens on high-throughput sequencing or real-time rt-pcr assay these findings were rechecked by the zhuhai center for disease control in guangdong province by detailed review of the electronic medical records we collected information such as the patients epidemiological history time of last contact time of last contact with a known infected individual or of leaving hubei province date of onset of disease day when symptoms first noticed time of attending a clinic admission time laboratory test positive and negative conversion times chest radiological abnormalities and time to improvement follow-up lasted until the 24th of february 2020 two experienced radiologists independently evaluated all ct dataquantitative data were analyzed by using by pearsons 2 or fishers exact test for discrete variables where appropriate p-values  005 were considered to denote significant differences all tests were two-tailed and associations were assessed with odds ratios or and 95 confidence intervals cis all analyzes were performed using spss software release 250 graphpad prism 8 and microsoft exceltwo of the 87 hospitalized patients with covid-19 were excluded because they had not undergone ct imaging one a 77-year-old man was in a critical condition and died 32 days after admission the other was too young to undergo a ct scan the median age of the remaining 85 enrolled patients was 43 years range 180 565 4885 were female and 788 6785 of patients or their family members had visited hubei province within 14 days of onset of disease one or more comorbidities were present in 435 3785 patients the commonest being cardiovascular disease 459 1737 endocrine disease 243 937 respiratory disease 108 437 and malignant tumors 108 437 on admission 22 patients had mild infections 56 moderate and seven severe table 1the commonest symptoms throughout the disease were fever 753 6485 cough 553 4785 and sore throat 235 2085 and the less frequently occurring symptoms were fatigue 129 1185 muscular soreness 129 1185 and headache 106 985 the least common symptoms were diarrhea chest distress nausea orand vomiting seven individuals were completely asymptomatic table 2 the times of onset of fever respiratory symptoms and digestive tract symptoms were collected and it was found that fever and respiratory symptoms often occurred simultaneously figure 1a whereas digestive tract symptoms appeared later than fever figure 1b most patients were admitted to hospital within 1 week of onset of fever figure 1cthe median time from the last exposure to the onset of disease was 2 days 6 to 16 symptoms developed within 1 week after the last contact in 741 6385 of patients and 118 1085 left the epidemic areaconfirmed patient after onset of symptoms figure 2a the median time between onset of symptoms and the first rt-pcr-positive throat swab was 4 days 015 rt-pcr-positivity occurring within 1 week of the onset of symptoms in most cases figure 2b the median time from the last contact to the first rt-pcr positive throat swab was 8 days 018 906 7785 of patients having positive rt-pcr tests within 14 days of leaving the epidemic area or confirmed patients and 212 1885 of patients were completely asymptomatic or had very mild symptoms most of these 18 patients were diagnosed during observation as inpatients because they were close contacts the longest interval from contact to rt-pcr-positivity was 18 days which may mean that the incubation period of sars-cov-2 is longer than is currently believed a longer isolation time is therefore required figure 2c the median time from admission to the first positive rt-pcr throat swab was 0 days 2 to 12 although one patient was first found to be rt-pcr-positive on the 12th day of admission 894 7685 patients tested positive for rt-pcr within 1 day of admission figure 2d indicating that the scope of screening needs to be extended to maximize identification of asymptomatic carrierstwice negative rt-pcr tests is one of the criteria for lifting of quarantine at the time of final follow-up 80 patients had met this criterion the median times from last contact onset and admission to twice negative rt-pcr tests were 19 days 638 15 days 536 and 11 days 326 respectively most patients had recovered and were discharged in the second week after admission figure 3 of the remaining five the longest hospitalization was 35 days the other four all being hospitalized for more than 2 weeksin addition to rt-pcr ct is an essential component of evaluations chest cts generally showed small patchy shadows and interstitial lung disease which further developed into ground glass attenuation and infiltration pulmonary consolidation occurred in severely affected patients however pleural effusion was relatively rareabnormal chest imaging findings were present at the time of admission in 718 6185 patients those with abnormalities being significantly older than those with normal ct scans on admission median age 50 3-80 vs 37 1-69 p  0031 patients encountered fever could be a predictor of abnormal chest imaging findings p  0016 table

addition 10 of the 24 patients with normal imaging findings on admission developed pulmonary abnormalities on ct as the disease progressed such patients being older than those with persistently normal chest ct scans median age 38 3369 vs 29 1-65 years p  0089 when we examined the time intervals between the last contact of these 10 patients and onset gray isolation green admission blue and first abnormal ct findings orange we found that the last contact isolation and admission of four of them were on the same day figure 4the median times from the last contact onset and admission to the first abnormal ct scan in the 71 patients who had abnormal ct scans at some stage were 8 days 019 4 days 016 and 1 day 419 respectively imaging abnormalities developed at varying intervals after the last contact with no clear peak in timing figure 5a most patients had imaging abnormalities within 1 week of onset of the disease figure 5b a few had imaging abnormalities before admission and the vast majority were found to have lung lesions within 2 days of admission however one patient did not show imaging changes until 19 days after admission figure 5cthere were no significant differences in the number of infected lobes in patients with imaging abnormalities on admission table 1 analysis of patterns of distribution in the affected lungs of 61 patients on admission revealed that the probability of lesions was lowest in the right middle lobe the risks of infection in the right upper right lower left upper and left lower lobes were 25 49 34 and 138 times higher respectively than the risk of infection in the right middle lobe the left lower lobe was the most frequently involved its rate of infection being 40 56 and 28 times higher than that of the left upper right upper and right lower lobes respectively table 3the risk of lesions in the right and left lower lobes did not differ significantly in the 85 patients on admission the rates of lesions in the right uppermiddlelower lobe and left upperlower lobe being 365 212 and 482 as well as 424 and 612 respectively up to 24 february the endpoint of our study the predominant site of lung lesions was the left lower lobe 635 however this rate did not differ significantly from that of the right lower 624 or left upper lobe 494 the risk of lesions in the right middle lobe was still the lowest table 4when we examined the time from last exposure to detection of lesions in each lobe we found that the median interval was 9 days for the right upper lobe 023 8 days for the right middle lobe 023 8 days for the right lower lobe 024 8 days for the left upper lobe 024 and 8 days for the left lower lobe 024 most patients showed imaging changes in the second week after the last contact figure 6a the median times from onset to detection of lesions in each lung lobe were 4 days for the right upper lobe 020 4 days for the right middle lobe 014 4 days for the right lower lobe 014 4 days for the left upper lobe 016 and 5 days for the left lower lobe 016 thus most imaging abnormalities appeared within 1 week of the onset of symptoms figure 6b one patient showed imaging changes 24 days after the last contactthe incubation period is important in diagnosis and control of infectious diseases the most recent study reported a mean incubation period of 52 days 95 confidence interval ci 4170 the 95th percentile of the distribution being 125 days we recommend that the duration of quarantine should be at least 14 days on the basis of the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period 10 in our study one asymptomatic patient tested positive for viral nucleic acid as long as 18 days after leaving hubei indicating that patients with sars-cov-2 may need to be isolated for longerin our study achievement of twice negative rt-pcr throat swabs ranged from 5 to 36 days after onset the possibility of reverting to positive after viral conversion has not been ruled out thus far we do not have a clear understanding of this aspect of the etiology of sars-cov-2 given that the time to mers-cov negativity among survivors ranges from 1 to 44 days from illness onset 11 it may be necessary to set a longer period of follow-upin our study the proportion of patients with fever at any stage of the disease was 753 6485 which is similar to that reported from jiangsu 22 january to 24 february 2020 788 6380 7 and guangzhou from 26 january to 4 february 2020 78 7090 8 all of these rates are lower than that reported from wuhan hubei province which was 83986 12 13 one possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that the outbreak in wuhan was the earliest and most serious the research period being during january the disease spread to other areas from around the end of january to february because medical departments were by then alert to the importance of extensive screening and early detection and isolation of infected individuals these patients symptoms were mild at the time of admission to hospital furthermore 35 385 of patients in our study only had digestive tract symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea without any respiratory symptoms or fever on admission of individuals who were screened because they were close contacts 82 785 had a concealed onset without no obvious symptomsour previous study showed that viral loads can be detected in asymptomatic patients indicating that asymptomatic patients may also be infectious and are likely to be highly contagious in the early stages of infection 14 thus in contrast to sars these characteristics indicate the need to expand the scope of screening and screen earlier thereby ensuring accurate identification and management of patients in the early stages of disease progression and preventing a potential pandemic in the absence of a vaccine or treatmentchest ct imaging is also very useful in early detection of suspected cases the typical imaging manifestations of covid-19 are similar to those of sars namely ground glass opacities in the lung parenchyma in the early stages and areas of consolidation in the later stages some of which are round the lesions are mostly distributed on the periphery of the lung 15 on admission 718 6185 patients had abnormal imaging findings these patients were older than the other 282 2485 patients who had normal ct scans p  0031 however we detected no predilection for male vs female patients and found no differences in other clinical features between the two groups pathological changes can occur in both lungs mainly in both lower lobes and the risk of infection in the left lower lobe is 138 times higher than that in the right middle lobe this conclusion is consistent with salehis research 16 and we speculate that it may be due to the physiological structure of the right middle lobe in addition whether there is a difference in gene expression in the right middle lobe leads to different susceptibility which requires further study of pathological data and in-depth study of the mechanismas the course of the disease progressed 1024 417 patients developed new lung lesions and the risk of infection is highest in the left lower lobe and lowest in the right middle lobe by dynamically observing changes in ct findings we found that lesions characteristically appeared first in the lower lung and developed upward which may explain the late appearance of upper respiratory symptoms after exposure to the source of infection possibly because our study cohort is too small our findings do not reflect the time differences in imaging lesions it is also possible that some patients were in clusters as having experienced close contact between an initially diagnosed patient being found to have pulmonary lesions on ct scans the fact that pulmonary lesions do not appear soon after exposure does not mean indicate that sars-cov-2 has a short incubation periodwithin a week of onset 50 of our patients had abnormal chest ct scans whereas 61 had positive rt-pct tests suggesting that rt-pcr detects sars-cov-2 earlier than chest ct imagingthis study has several limitations first no ct scans were performed before admission thus lung lesions may appear earlier than we detected second as we had a small cohort of patients and short follow-up our conclusions need to be further verified by large samples and multi-center datain conclusion in this observational study the incubation period of sars-cov-2 was found to sometimes exceed 14 days indicating the need for more prolonged surveillance most lung lesions appear within 2 weeks of onset the median interval being 45 days the lesions were predominantly in both lower lungs the risk of lesions being lowest for the right middle lobe further in-depth study of patients with covid-19 is still

potential conflict of interestcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute pneumonia caused by the -coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 this virus is enveloped spherical or oval in shape polymorphic and has a diameter of 60140 nm 1 genetically it is significantly different from sars-cov and mers-cov while covid-19 patients are the main source of infection asymptomatic patients can be similarly infectious the main transmission routes are through respiratory droplets and close contact transmission is also possible when individuals are exposed to high concentrations of aerosols in a sealed environment while faecal-oral transmission remains to be confirmed 2 3 4 the clinical signs of infection include lower respiratory tract disease accompanied by fever dry cough and dyspnoea a positive test for the sars-cov-2 nucleic acid is required for definitive diagnosis 5 however while the specificity of nucleic acid testing is high the sensitivity is relatively low and there is an appreciable false negative rate diagnosis with chest computed tomography ct is more intuitive and faster chest ct is therefore the main method used for screening and diagnosis 67 ct scans play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of lung disease based on our experience the imaging findings in covid-19 infection are diverse and range from a normal appearance to diffuse pulmonary changes in this study we retrospectively analysed ct imaging data from 95 patients with confirmed covid-19 in our hospital in order to examine the ct characteristics of infectionin our hospital 95 patients underwent ct scans and tested positive for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid this study included patients who met one of the following three sets of criteria 1 history of residence in the region of the epidemic within the last 2 weeks apparent pulmonary lesions and positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test results 2 patients with the above epidemiological history accompanied by fever sore throat diarrhoea and other respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms abnormal pulmonary lesions and positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test results 3 subjects who came into contact with patients with fever without personal protection and who had a positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test result positive first ct scan results and lung abnormalities on re-examination the following patients were excluded from analysis 1 patients with a medical history supportive of covid-19 infection but no history of contact with people in the epidemic region or with patients with feverrespiratory symptoms 2 patients with respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis tumours and other types of pneumonia 3 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms due to a gastrointestinal disorder or lesions leading to loss of appetite 4 patients with complicated respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms resulting from other causes such as trauma bleeding or malignancythis study included 53 males and 42 females aged from 10 months to 81 years mean age 42  12 years sixty-nine patients 726 experienced fever fatigue and dry cough while 15 158 experienced poor appetite and fatigue and 11 116 had a

re-examinations were carried out every 57 days to assess lesion outcomesafter imaging of suspected covid-19 patients personal protective equipment was removed and appropriate disinfection procedures were followed for equipment and personnelimages were interpreted by two senior radiologists experienced in chest radiology all imaging data were analysed in the absence of clinical or laboratory results after independent evaluation any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and negotiationpatients with single or multiple local ground-glass opacities ggos in the subpleural region of the lung periphery or along the bronchovascular bundle as well as air bronchograms and mild septal thickening at adjacent lobes were included in the early stage imaging presentation group 8 the

on chest imaging during diagnosis fifty-three 558 patients were classified as early stage fig 1 fig 2
 these cases frequently showed peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities which were observed as local patches in 2253 patients 415 ground-glass opacities were seen with interlobular septal thickening in 453 patients 75 thirty-four 358 patients were classified into the progression stage fig 3 fig 4
 these patients commonly exhibited lesions in multiple lung segments and lobes 2134 618 with an uneven increase in ground-glass opacity density accompanied by consolidation and grid-like or cord-like shadows 30there were two 21 patients in the severe stage group fig 5

and the mean length of hospitalisation was 10  35 days on discharge lesions had significantly reduced in area or had completely disappeared though slight pulmonary fibrosis was present in some patients one severe stage patient was still hospitalised at the end of the follow-up period and one severe stage patient died the overall mortality rate was 105the typical clinical presentation of covid-19 is fever fatigue and dry cough this presentation is consistent with lower respiratory tract infection nasal congestion runny nose and other upper respiratory tract symptoms are rare dyspnoea may occur 1 week after disease onset and severely affected patients rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock refractory metabolic acidosis coagulation disorders and multiorgan failure most patients have a good prognosis 910 at the early stage of covid-19 infection the peripheral white blood cell count is normal or decreased the lymphocyte count is reduced and the neutrophil percentage is not elevated most patients have elevated serum amyloid a saa c-reactive protein crp and erythrocyte sedimentation rate these signs are more significant in severe pneumonia cases creatine kinase ck lactate dehydrogenase ldh and aspartate transaminase ast are elevated in severe disease some patients have elevated myoglobin and normal procalcitonin levels a positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test result is required for a definitive diagnosis of covid-19 but a negative test result does not necessarily preclude infection 25among the 95 covid-19 patients in this study ground-glass opacities 431 were mostly seen in the early stage imaging presentation and lesions were mainly located at the subpleural region in the lung periphery this distribution may be due to the fact that virus particles fuse with the alveolar epithelium when they reach the cortical lobules in the lower lungs this causes injury to the alveolar walls vascular congestion the accumulation of exudate in the alveoli swelling around the lobule and the simultaneous involvement of multiple adjacent lobules in the early stage of disease this mainly presents as interstitial ground-glass opacities at later stages of disease the lobules fuse resulting in an irregular morphology and distribution of lesions that does not follow lung segments and a fan-like distribution of lesions in subpleural areas 1112 in the progression stage expansion of the lesion area is typically seen with frequent involvement of multiple lung segments and lobes 2134 618 some patients may present with ground-glass opacities in combination with consolidation and grid-like or cord-like shadows 305 this is mainly due to the collapse of alveolar walls and the replacement of air in the alveoli with inflammatory exudate cells or tissue the loss of air contrast causes the walls of pulmonary blood vessels and the trachea to become blurry this often results from interstitial inflammatory thickening 13 during the progression stage air bronchograms or vascular thickening can be seen in consolidated areas the increase in permeability that underlies these changes may be due to pathogen invasion of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium which results in inflammatory cell infiltration and thickening and swelling of the tracheal walls however this does not lead to bronchiolar obstruction pathogen invasion of the epithelial cells in the lesion can also result in local vascular congestion and swelling in the latter stages of disease lesions may fuse or become partially absorbed 14 in the severe stage disease progression is rapid ground-glass opacities can be seen with cord-like interstitial thickening which is considered to be due to the accumulation of cells or exudate furthermore the entire lung can be involved with a white lung signin this study a few ground-glass opacities were located at the periphery of bronchovascular bundles in some early stage and progression stage patients in early stage patients the long axis of these lesions was typically vertical to the thoracic wall and parallel to the bronchovascular bundle 353 57 while some patients in the progression stage showed interstitial thickening 634 176 adjacent tracheal and bronchial walls did not show significant thickening in early stage patients while adjacent pleural oedema sometimes developed at the progression stage local interstitial thickening gradually became apparent some of the patients in this study had pleural thickening 53 while both of the severe stage patients showed mild pleural effusion this may have been due to pleural inflammation resulting in inflammatory exudates only one patient 11 had mediastinal lymph node enlargement due to other comorbiditiesin this study in 53 of mild cases the first ct scan was negative and re-examination 27 days later showed abnormalities the initial scans can be negative because the virus is located in the upper respiratory tract during the early stage and does not cause pulmonary infiltration and exudative lesions 14 some mild cases progress to moderate disease imaging in these cases typically reveals multiple lesions in the lung periphery or subpleural areas 5671 789 lesions are mostly seen in the lower lungs and multiple lesions are often seen bilaterally 4571 634 these cases typically have a similar ground-glass opacity presentation to cases in the progression stage but the lesions do not usually involve the entire lung segment patients with a severe clinical presentation 232 presented with diffuse bilateral lung consolidation air bronchograms and bronchiectasis and patchy ground-glass opacities visible in non-consolidated regions in critical patients 21 the white lung presentation was seen on imaging and the lesion area was extensive by combining the imaging and clinical data in our study we found that the progression of clinical symptoms in covid-19 patients often does not closely correspond to the disease stage seen on imaging this may partially be due to differences in patients immune status that affect their response at different stages of the disease another reason for this discrepancy could be that the history provided by patients regarding the onset of symptoms is not always accurate 15 16 17 18 19 20covid-19 disease can present with a diverse range of imaging findings a combination of epidemiological clinical and laboratory data as well as sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test results are required to differentiate it from other viral pneumonias in children uncharacteristic or unique imaging presentations may be seen in this disease so further studies of imaging findings in children are required 21 22 23 24 as covid-19 patients are infectious during the incubation period and after disease onset early diagnosis by imaging is vitalour study shows that certain findings on ct imaging are characteristic of covid-19 infection and progression understanding the imaging characteristics of covid-19 is important to support early diagnosis control and the evaluation of treatment results
table 1 staging of coronavirus disease 2019 based on ct imagingviral diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health the world has witnessed several viral epidemics in past twenty years that include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 in 2003 h1n1 influenza in 2009 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012recently an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in wuhan city hubei province of china and reported to china country office of the world health organization who on december 31 2019 the national health commission of china reported that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in wuhan city the etiological agent of the atypical pneumonia was isolated on january 7 2020 by the chinese authorities as novel coronavirus 2019-ncov the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus identified was shared to other countries to develop specific diagnostic kits on january 12 2020 subsequently the ministry of public health thailand the ministry of health labour and welfare japan and republic of korea reported their first imported case of lab-confirmed 2019-ncov on 13 january 13 january 15 and january 20 2020 respectively subsequently international committee on taxonomy of viruses termed it sars-cov-2 due to similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the sars on february 11 2020 the who announced that the disease caused by this new virus as a covid-19 which is the acronym of coronavirus disease 2019 on march 11 2020 who declared this disease as pandemic as of march 30 2020 who has reported 693224 case and 33104 death that has occurred worldwide 1coronavirus cov belongs to coronaviridae family of order nidovirale cov are single-stranded rna viruses ssrna having a spike glycoprotein on the envelope giving it a crown-like appearance when seen on electron microscope the subfamily orthocoronavirinae has four genera of covs alpha-coronavirus beta-coronavirus delta-coronavirus and gamma-coronavirus furthermore the genus beta-coronavirus divides into five sub-genera or lineages while bats and rodents are considered to be the genetic sources of alpha and beta-coronavirus avian species represents the genetic sources of delta and gamma-coronavirus 2to date seven human coronaviruses hcov have been identified the a lineage of beta-coronavirus such as hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 as well as alpha-coronavirus such as hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 causes common colds and self-limiting respiratory infections in contrast b lineage of beta-corona virus causes sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 covid-19 while c lineage of beta-corona virus causes mers-cov both responsible for recent epidemics with a variable clinical severity of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary involvement and associated significant increase in mortality 3covid-19 is a single-stranded positive sense rna virus having a diameter of 60140 nm with a round or elliptic shape however it often exists in pleomorphic form its rna genome contains 29891 nucleotides encoding for 9860 amino acids and shares 999 sequence identity suggesting a very recent host shift into humans 45 like other covs it is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat besides these viruses can be effectively inactivated by lipid solvents including chloroform ether 75 ethanol peroxyacetic acid and chlorine-containing disinfectant chlorhexidine does not inactivate this virus 4 5coronaviruses are naturally hosted by bats and it is believed that most human coronaviruses are derived from the bat reservoir 56 genomic sequence studies of covid-19 have identified nearly 50 79 and 96 similarity to mers-cov sars-cov-1 and bat sars-related coronavirus respectively 7 8 9 the specific route of transmission to human from natural reservoirs is still yet to be known however some of the studies suggests pangolin could be the intermediate mammalian hosts since spike protein of sar-cov-2 are nearly identical to one virus isolated from pangolin it is believed that pangolins could have provided a partial spike gene to sars-cov-2 to infect mammals 1011 a recent study has also shown a development of new variations at the functional sites in the receptor-binding domain of the spike of sars-cov-2 and viruses from pangolin likely caused due to either a natural selection or mutations or recombination or both 12nevertheless once human is infected virus could also be transmitted from human-to-human through the respiratory droplets and aerosols from coughing and sneezing like other respiratory pathogens including sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 also uses the angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 receptors like the sars-cov 13the incubation period of covid-19 could vary from 3 days to 14 days based on the data from chinese cdc the longest time from infection to symptoms was 125 days 95 ci 9218 days the chinese epidemic also doubled about every seven days and on average each patient transmits the infection to an additional 22 individuals suggesting the basic reproduction number r0 or r naught to be 22 which is a bit lesser compared to r0 of the sars-cov-1 epidemic of nearly 30 in 20022003 1415 an epidemiological and transmission difference in characteristics between sars-cov1 mers and covid-19 has been summarized in table 1
a recent study from a genetic analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes n  103 found this virus to be evolving into two major types designated as l and s with two different snps while the l type is more prevalent 70 aggressive and spread more quickly as seen in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan the s type 30 is an ancestral version evolutionarily older and less aggressive it appears that the frequency of the l type has decreased after early january 2020 and it is hypothesized that the change in selective pressure might change the behavior of this virus it is thought that coercive human interventions may have placed a more severe selective pressure on the l type to mutate to s type conversely the s type might have been increased also due to a relatively weaker selective pressure 13these ultra-rapid development in viral epidemics strongly suggest an urgent need of understanding about these viral dynamics to cope up with this public health emergency of covid-19there may be a variety of symptoms that a patient with covid-19 may present with the usual triad to suspect is fever dry cough and dyspnea it may be classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic carrier or infective state from mild prodrome to profusely symptomatic depending upon immunity status of patients there are reports of conjunctivitis gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea vomiting nausea abdominal pain some critically ill may present without fever but with abdominal pain anorexia and dyspnea less common symptoms were gastrointestinal anosmia dysgeusia 13 overall the case fatality rate was varied between 23 and 5 with an average of 3 poor prognostic epidemiological risk factors include older age male sex smokers and associated comorbidities including obesity hypertension diabetes chronic pulmonary diseases cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease more the number of risk factors more is the severity at presentation 18depending on the clinical features of covid-19 patients are generally divided as mild moderate severe and critical 18a
mild covid-19 low grade fever cough malaise rhinorrhea sore throat with or without hemoptysis nausea vomiting diarrhea but without any radiological features of pneumonia and absence of mental changesb

serology blood sampling is much easier than swab sampling from oropharynx or nasopharynx two kinds of serological test can detect covid-19 - a enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay elisa and b immunochromatography card test elisa is considered better compared to card test due to higher sensitivity while elisa has sensitivity of 873 card test has a sensitivity of 824 and both have specificity of 100 however card test is convenient cheaper and offers a rapid turnover 25 elisa is based on rp3 nucleoprotein to detect igm and igg against sars-cov-2 although elisa has quick turn over time however it may have a false positive results due to n nucleocapsid proteins of sars-cov-2 1626 cross reactivity is expected with sars-cov-1 infection since there is 90 homology in genetic sequence with sars-cov-2 hence s protein transmembrane glycoprotein spike elisa should be developed specific to sars-cov-2
reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr rt-pcr and genomic sequencing wherever available is the gold standard and confirmatory test for covid-19 overall the sensitivity of rt-pcr is nearly 70 with a 30 false negative rate and its sensitivity decreases from 90 on day 1- to 3 post-symptoms to nearly 80 on day 6 and  50 by day 14 27 for rt-pcr specimen collection from the upperlower respiratory tract or sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples to be performed under strict precautions and should be taken as early as symptom onset to obtain high virus concentrations 28 it should be noted that rt-pcr may take few hours to 2 days for reporting and second sample with different viral gene may be needed if initial test is negative moreover rt-pcr may be false negative at a times eg low viral load in very early phase or in late phase of disease mutation of covid-19 virus or other technical difficulties in collection of samples similarly result may be false-positive in influenza or other respiratory pathogens in either case it is important to remain vigilant other issues with rt-pcr is incorrect sample collection and processing potential risk to health care workers due to aerosol transmission beside delayed report delivery requirement of expertise setup of laboratory and the cost 27although both serology and rt-pcr are complimentary to each other however since antibodies can appear as early as 1-day post-symptoms it is estimated that igm-elisa can detect more cases than rt-pcr on day 55 of illness 27 while another study reported a higher sensitivity 667 of rt-pcr in first week compared to the serological test 380 however during second week the serological test had higher sensitivity than rt-pcr collectively this suggest ideally to combine both the modalities of test to increase the sensitivity for early detection and diagnosis of covid-19 2728 indeed the combined igm-elisa plus rt-pcr has been shown to detect 986 of cases versus 519 with a single rt-pcr 26 27 28from the available evidence 1625 26 27 28 and to put the things in to perspective it is logical as well as advisable but not superseding any recommendation if any that  a for the rapid screening of sars-cov-2 carriers symptomatic or asymptomatic combined igm- igg-elisa may offer a better utility and sensitivity compared to a either a igm- or igg-elisa test alone b all symptomatic subjects or contacts should be assessed with rapid antibody testing first if positive then rt-pcr should be done as the confirmatory test c all highly suspicious cases should undergo rt-pcr first even if the rapid antibody tests are negative d if antibody test is negative initially it should be re-tested after 710 days
bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage bal may be done when sputum sample cannot be obtained to rule out alternative diagnosis such as tuberculosis and other bacterial or fungal pneumonias and to remove bronchial mucous plugs strict precautions are to be taken while doing bal to avoid aerosol infections the sensitivity positivity rates of rt-pcr in patients with sars-cov-2 in different specimen in was lowest for urine 0 and highest for bal 93 as summarized in table 4

participants will be divided into three cohorts and will be administered 25 g mcg 100mcg or 250mcg dose 28 days apartpresently treatment of covid-19 is only supportive and prevention is the only way to reduce the community transmission convalescent sera from covid-19 positive patients has been approved by fda in severe and critical patients only 27 although no anti-viral therapy or other drugs till the time of writing is proven to work substantially against the covid-19 in humans few small-scale studies have claimed some benefit with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in less severely ill patients other drugs which are also being tried include lopinavirritonavir remdesivir favipiravir oseltamivir ribavirin interferon beta tocilizumab and abidol 32 multiple rcts are currently undergoing with these agents and results are eagerly awaitedsars-cov-2 is more infectious than sars-cov-1 and mers-cov most infections with covid-19 are generally mild and self-limiting however even asymptomatic carriers may spread infection newer possibilities of feco-oral transmission are also speculated rapid diagnostic tests will be helpful for screening and diagnosing covid-19 patients trials for specific anti-viral drugs and vaccine are currently underway to curb the pandemic meanwhile isolation and containment is only way of prevention from contracting covid-19we hereby declare that we have no conflict of interest related to this articlein december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 first appeared in wuhan china causing a serious coronavirus disease called covid-19 1 initially believed to have originated in animals it was later shown to be able to spread from person to person 2 3 on january 21 2020 the covid-19 was classified into a category b infectious disease of high priority requiring countrywide management measures category a management measures in china on january 30 who declared that the outbreak of sars-cov-2 was a public health emergency of international concern pheic as of march 26 2020 there have been 552943 cases of covid-19 confirmed in 200 countries and regions including 399192 active cases 25045 deaths and 128706 cases recovered on march 2 the european cdc raised the sars-cov-2 risk level from moderate to high almost the entire globe is now designated by the us cdc as under a class 3 travel advisory on march 11 2020 the who declared covid-19 a pandemic global travel has been severely restricted and mass quarantine measures have been implemented in almost every countrythe symptoms of covid-19 are non-specific ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and death fever and cough are the most common clinical symptoms abnormal chest computed tomography ct has been used to diagnose 674880 cases of covid-19 indicating that pneumonia is the most common manifestation of the disease 46 therefore ct imaging is widely used in the early diagnosis of the disease but chest ct may not distinguish covid-19 from other viral pneumonias 79 nucleic acid assay gene sequencing and serology examination igm and igg from throat swabs or blood samples have been developed to establish a pathologic diagnosis 7 however clinicians in wuhan have raised the issue of high false negative rate of pcr or antibody detection 10 combination use of medical history clinical manifestations chest ct and the viral test has been found to have high sensitivity 9297 5 6 based on current understanding of covid-19 the chinese government regularly provides an updated clinical protocol to guide screening tactics to manage covid-19 in epidemic areas globally early diagnosis of covid-19 is still a major challengea search was carried out in medline pubmed cnki wanfang sinomed 2019 novel coronavirus resource 2019ncovr of china national center for bioinformation and scientific platform for the new coronavirus pneumonia of china medical journal network to identify published studies on the new coronavirus our search strategy included the terms 2019-ncov 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 and covid-19 relevant articles published in english or chinese were includedthe covid-19 breakout was initially associated with wuhan huanan seafood wholesale market however 13 of the first confirmed 41 cases had no contact history with the market thus the origin of sars-cov-2 remains to be determined 11 12 bioinformatics analysis revealed that the sequence homology was 96 between sars-cov-2 and bat-cov-ratg13 previously detected in rhinolophus affinis from yunnan province rather than the earlier sars-cov sequence homology less than 80 therefore the chinese chrysanthemum bat was speculated to be the origin of sars-cov-2 1315 further investigation identified that pangolin might be a potential intermediate host because the s1 protein of pangolin-cov is virtually identical to that of sars-cov-2 on the other hand the genomic similarity of sars-cov-2 has been found to be lower compared with pangolin-cov than bat-cov-ratg13 1619 these findings suggest that further studies are required to trace intermediate hosts in the jump from bats to humansalthough respiratory droplets and direct contact are the main routes of transmission 2 4 7 20 other routes include aerosol and fecal-oral transmission fig 1 4 21in mid-january 2020 studies of clusters of infected family members and medical workers confirmed person-to-person transmission 2 3 22 close contact with symptomatic individuals constitutes the major risk for extensive transmission ongoing spread may rely on unknown transmission by asymptomatic hosts 20 guan et al reported that of the 35 of infected patients who were identified as healthcare workers 19 313 and 723 of patients had a history of contact with wildlife recent traveled to wuhan and contact with people from wuhan respectively 4respiratory dropletssars-cov-2 is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets 2 4 7 20 when a patient coughs or sneezes aerial droplets containing virus may be inhaled by susceptible individualsdirect contactguan et al found that 718 of non-local residents developed covid-19 due to contact with individuals from wuhan 4 more than 1800 of 2055  88 medical workers with covid-19 were in hubei according to reports from 475 hospitals 20indirect contactthis occurs when droplets containing sars-cov-2 land on the surface of tabletops doorknobs telephones and other inanimate objects the virus is transferred from the surface to the mucous membranes by contaminated fingers touching the mouth nose or eyes 23 studies have estimated that sars-cov-2 can exist for up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 c and a humidity of 4050 and can survive for less than 48 h in dry air with a reduction in viability after 2 h 24asymptomatic transmissionasymptomatic infections have been reported in at least two cases with exposure history to a potentially pre-symptomatic patient who was later diagnosed with covid-19 the virus was then transmitted to another three healthy family members 25 26 prior to the development of symptoms individuals may not be isolated and may constitute an important mobile viral source this transmission contributes to the difficulties in containing the spread of the disease 27 28interfamilial transmissiontransmission within family clusters is very common one study reported that 78 to 85 of cases in large aggregate groups occurred due to interfamilial transmission in sichuan and guangdong china 20aerosol transmissionin a closed environment with poor ventilation aerosols may remain airborne for 2448 h and spread from several meters to dozens of meters 7 29 30 however there has been no strong evidence for aerosol transmission the who also deemed that this route requires further investigation 31 32ocular transmissionit has been reported that a doctor without eye protection was infected during an inspection in wuhan on january 22 2020 33 further studies found that sars-cov-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions of covid-9 patients 34 35fecal-oral transmissionthis was first reported in a covid-19 case in the usa 21 subsequent studies detected sars-cov-2 in the feces and anal swabs of covid-19 patients 4 36 furthermore 233 of covid-19 patients remained sars-cov-2 positive in feces even when the viral rna was no longer detectable in the respiratory tract sars-cov-2 has also been detected in gastric duodenal and rectal epithelia 37there is insufficient evidence to support vertical transmission as samples from neonates born to sars-cov-2-positive mothers have been negative 3841 moreover no viral rna has been detected from the vaginal environment of 35 female patients suggesting a lack of evidence for sexual transmission of sars-cov-2 42with the increasing number of covid-19 cases all individuals have a theoretical risk of contact with virus carriers 33 major risk factors for developing severe infection include old people and the presence of comorbidities or underlying diseases such as hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease 4 20 43 a study of 1524 cancer patients showed that they had a twofold increased risk of covid-19 than the general population 44 other high-risk populations include those who are immunosuppressed due to primary or acquired immunodeficiency syndromes or those who are iatrogenically immunosuppressedpregnant women can develop covid-19 infection 3841 the data on children suggests that the disease in children is less severe in a study of 55924 patients with covid-19 children under the age of 18 years comprised 24 of these 25 had severe disease and 02 were categorized as critically ill 20 it is estimated that in china there have been fewer than 10 deaths among individuals under the age of 30 so far 43 intriguingly the pediatric patients were found through tracking close contacts of infected individuals and were not found in turn to transmit the virus to adults 20 healthcare personnel are at a high risk of being infected in one study 29 of 139 hospitalized patients were medical workers 45

the imaging findings of covid-19 can be variable and change rapidly radiological examinations are important for early detection monitoring and evaluation of covid-19 54 there were usually no abnormal findings at the early stage with digital radiography dr therefore ct is recommended for the early detection of subtle changes not found on dr 54 typical chest ct findings include peripherally distributed multifocal ground-glass opacities ggos with patchy consolidations increasing numbers extent and density of ggos on chest ct correlated with disease progression 55pan et al collected ct images from 63 confirmed covid-19 patients and found that 607 of the patients had more than two affected lobes fifty-four 857 patients had patchy or punctate ggos 12 190 patients had patchy consolidation 11 175 patients had fibrous stripes and 8 127 patients had irregular solid nodules 56 another study comprised 51 cases and the ct images showed pure ggos in 77 of patients ggos with reticular andor interlobular septal thickening in 75 of patients ggos with consolidation in 59 of patients and pure consolidation in 55 of patients eighty-six percent had bilateral lung involvement 80 had involvement of the posterior portion of the lung and 86 had peripheral involvement 57 in severe cases the chest ct showed bilateral patchy shadowing in 792 patients followed by ggos in 584 patients local patchy shadowing in 532 patients and interstitial abnormalities in 254 patients 4a descriptive study analyzed chest ct images from 81 confirmed patients and found that covid-19 pneumonia rapidly evolved from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ggos and progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 13 weeks 58 the appearance of interstitial changes suggests the development of fibrosis however there is currently no evidence for these lung changes as irreversible fibrosis 58 in another retrospective study on chest ct results of 21 asymptomatic patients with covid-19 three 14 patients showed no ggos or consolidation fifteen 71 patients showed involvement of more than two lobes 12 57 patients only had ggos and 6 29 patients had ggos with consolidation 59 feng et al analyzed the ct features of 15 children with confirmed disease 4 to 14 years old and found that nine patients had small nodular ggos but six patients had no lesions 60
diagnostic testsreverse transcription pcr rt-pcr assay is widely used in the early diagnosis and monitoring of sars-cov-2 infections rt-pcr was positive in 59 to 782 of cases 5 6 61 this assay may detect the viral rna in the early stage of clinical symptoms even with negative ct findings 62 gene sequencing can identify sars-cov-2 accurately but the major disadvantages are that it is very time-consuming and expensive gene sequencing is more important for research on the variants and origin of sasr-cov-2 20 based on recent data in 397 cases specific igm specific igg and specific igm  specific igg had a sensitivity of 181 60 and 645 respectively 63 serological assays require only 15 min to generate results and can be used for rapid screening in clinics 63

on january 16 2020 the national health commission nhc of china published the first clinical protocol based on the initial experience of several hundred of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia over the past few months an abundance of information has been acquired from the vast number of cases in china and the data is increasing daily thus far nhc has published seven versions of clinical protocols to facilitate early diagnosis and early treatment of the disease table 3 figure 2 is a flowchart to help identify and assess covid-19 that is based on these protocols and clinical experience from february to march 2020 the mortality rate and hospital infections reported in wuhan have decreasedsince the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic the nhc of china has successively released 7 versions of diagnosis and treatment protocols and 6 versions of prevention and control plans hubei beijing shanghai tibet and other cities have also introduced regional plans as scientific evidence accumulates these protocol updates can be based more on evidence-based practice than on empirical experienceduring the early phase of the covid-19 outbreak the sequencing of sars-cov-2 genome was published and reported to who 1 studies on the virological and epidemiological characteristics of sars-cov-2 are key to the containment of the virus it has been shown that human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 occurs mainly through droplets or direct contact 11 64the incubation period is still unknown but may be up to 14 days in most patients and as long as 24 days in several cases 4 gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon which is different from sars-cov 65 and mers-cov 66 infection further investigations to clarify the viral tropism of sars-cov-2 are important for understanding its transmission and treatment older patients  65 years with comorbidities and ards are at an increased risk of death and men seem more likely to be infected than women the overall mortality rate is estimated to be 23 1023 deaths among 44762 confirmed cases of covid-19 based on experience within china 67 compared with greater than 10 mortality of sars-cov 68 and 35 mortality of mers-cov 69 sars-cov-2 has a lower mortality rate but appears to be more contagious the mortality rate may be even lower in the real-world setting once the infection has stabilized many studies may not include mildly ill patients who did not seek medical help xus study 70 found that compared with patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan the symptoms of patients in zhejiang province were relatively mild there is a potential association between covid-19 mortality and healthcare resources 71 and the mortality rate outside wuhan may be much lowersome studies have postulated that the gender difference is related to the important role that both the x chromosomes and sex hormones play in the bodys immune system 72 although the mechanism is unknown chest ct findings of covid-19 include peripherally distributed multifocal ground-glass opacities ggos with patchy consolidations even in asymptomatic patients suggesting that radiological examinations are important in the early detection observation and evaluation of covid-19 patients with laboratory-confirmed disease without radiologic manifestations have also been reported 4the most common laboratory abnormality in covid-19 patients is lymphopenia which is more profound in severe cases this suggests that sars-cov-2 may primarily attack lymphocytes particularly t lymphocytes as sars-cov does 73 virus particles infect cells inducing a cytokine storm in the body generating a series of immune responses and causing changes in peripheral white blood cells and immune cells consequently the low absolute value of lymphocytes may be used as a reference index in the diagnosis or to classify severity of sars-cov-2 infections 74 at present it is possible to predict prognosis using symptoms signs and imaging findings but there are challenges symptoms signs and imaging abnormalities are often seen later in the disease course so early detection may be difficult in addition once the condition deteriorates it may lead to a vicious circle ultimately resulting in critical illness or death the care of these patients requires a high level of medical resources equipment and infrastructure slowing the spreading of the disease helps to flatten the curve which helps to prevent overtaxing of healthcare systemslimitations of this review include the lack of uniformity between previous papers documenting the clinical manifestations of covid-19 data derived from patients with sars-cov-2 infection in wuhan china the clinical and epidemiology characteristics summarized in studies from wuhan may be impacted by a shortage of medical resources in wuhan 71 the experience in cities and countries outside of wuhan china may be different as the virus has undergone mutations even since its first appearance in december 2019 70 there is also a lack of information regarding communicability in the early phases of the disease in patients who have not yet manifested symptoms of covid-19 or in asymptomatic carriers clinical information in some patients who have covid-19 may be lacking as a result of failure to seek treatment in early stages with mild presentation or a lack of awareness of the disease although by now most people are vigilant or even hypervigilant a shortage of detection kits can also hinder identification and confirmation of infected individuals 75 these limitations can impact the accuracy of prior research lastly because many patients are still ill in the hospital the prognosis and the outcomes are incompletely elucidated most of the current studies are cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are requiredthe infectious agent driving the ongoing pneumonia outbreak the 2019-ncov appears to have transitioned from animals into humans with the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan china representing the most likely source 12345 since then cases have been recorded in other countries and initial estimates suggest a hospital fatality risk of around 14 6 although estimates of disease severity early in an outbreak are often imprecise 789 even countries without confirmed cases have been on high alert for example even prior to the two cases in the united kingdom on 31 january 2020 officials were reported to be attempting to trace as many as 2000 visitors that had travelled to that country from wuhan 10the most devastating infectious disease outbreaks are those that have a wide geographical range as opposed to being confined to a small region 1112 the previously known virus that is most similar to the 2019-ncov is the sars coronavirus 13 which generated cases in 37 countries in 20022003 1314 since the 2019-ncov is clearly capable of being transmitted by infected hosts to countries around the world an important question for policy makers is whether or not these imported cases have the potential to generate sustained human-to-human transmission in new locationshere we present data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients from the current outbreak obtained from publicly available line lists 15 we fit an exponential distribution to these data accounting for uncertainty due to the limited numbers of patients from whom data were available assuming that this distribution characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the community it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission we estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-ncov is similar to that of the sars coronavirus and then go on to consider the effect of shortening the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation this provides an estimate of the risk that imported cases generate sustained outbreaks in new locations under different surveillance levelsthe distribution of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation was estimated using patient data from the ongoing outbreak 15 data are shown in figure 1a since the precise times of symptom onset and hospitalisation on the dates concerned were unknown we converted the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation to intervals describing possible time periods see the supplementary data for example for a case showing symptoms on 9 january 2020 and then being hospitalised on 14 january 2020 the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation lies between four and six days see eg supplementary material of 16 for a similar calculation this is because the minimum possible period involves symptom onset at the end of 9 january and hospitalisation at the start of 14 january whereas the maximum possible period involves symptom onset early on 9 january and hospitalisation late on 14 januarywe then fitted the rate parameter  of an exponential distribution to these interval-censored data using markov chain monte carlo mcmc a chain of length 10000000 in addition to a burn-in of 100000 was used the chain was then sampled with a thinning interval of 100 steps giving rise n  100000 equally possible distributions for the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation each characterised by a parameter estimate i i12n for further details of the mcmc algorithm used see the supplementary textthe distributions of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation were used to estimate the probability that an imported case will lead to sustained transmission by assuming that infections occur according to a branching process eg 171819 in this branching process the effective reproduction number accounting for control interventions other than intensified surveillance which we model explicitly of the 2019-ncov when the virus arrives in a new location is denoted by r where the parameter  represents pathogen transmissibility 20 we assumed that the transmissibility of the virus is similar to that of the sars coronavirus ie rsarssars where rsars3 21 and the mean infection duration for sars is 1sars38 days 22 however we adjusted the infectious period to account for the data describing the times between symptom onset and hospitalisation in the current outbreak in doing this we assumed that the time between an individual first displaying symptoms and being hospitalised was the period in which that individual was potentially transmitting the virus in the communitythe probability of a sustained transmission chain 1920 starting from a single index case can be estimated for each of the equally possible distributions for the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation

and figure s1 from the patient data in figure 1a this gave rise to a range of equally plausible distributions describing these time periods blue lines in figure 1b the average of these distributions is shown by the red line in figure 1b however we used the full range of distributions in our calculations of the probability of sustained transmission occurring from each imported caseeach of the range of plausible distributions corresponded to an estimate for the probability of a self-sustaining outbreak equation 1 and histogram in figure 1c a single estimate for the probability of sustained transmission can be obtained by summing over the range of distributions using equation 2 the resulting probability of sustained transmission is 041 red line in figure 1c with credible interval cri 027 055 where the cri reflects the 5th and 95th percentile estimateswe then considered the reduction in the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission if surveillance is more intense specifically we assumed that intensified surveillance led to a reduction in the mean period from symptom onset to hospitalisation governed by the parameter  where 0 corresponds to no intensification of surveillance and 1 corresponds to an implausible scenario in which infectious cases are hospitalised immediately we found that if surveillance is intensified so that the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation is halved the probability that each imported case leads to sustained transmission is reduced to only 0012 cri 0 0099 figure 1dfinally we considered the combined effect if multiple cases arrive in a new location in that scenario intense surveillance has the potential to reduce the risk of sustained transmission significantly compared to weak surveillance for   05 the probability that any of 10 imported cases generate a substantial outbreak is only 012 cri 0 065 figure 2c this highlights the importance of rigorous surveillance particularly in locations where infected hosts are most likely to travelthere are concerns that the ongoing outbreak driven by the 2019-ncov could spread globally 35232425 with sustained transmission in countries around the world periods of high travel rates such as the recent chinese new year holiday present a significant challenge since they pose an elevated risk of importations of the virus to new locations 313 in an effort to prevent a surge in travel the chinese government extended the national new year holiday in january 2020here we have estimated the potential for cases arriving in new locations to lead to sustained transmission according to the basic model that we have constructed if surveillance levels are similar to those in china at the beginning of the current outbreak and if this virus is similarly transmissible to the sars coronavirus that spread globally in 20022003 then the probability that each imported infected case generates an outbreak due to sustained transmission is approximately 041 cri 027 055 figure 1c however under a higher level of surveillance the risk of sustained outbreaks is substantially lower figure 1d this result is particularly striking when multiple independent cases travel to a new location either simultaneously or in sequence figure 2 in that scenario intensified surveillance is particularly importantour study involves the simplest possible model that permits the risk of sustained transmission to be estimated from the very limited data that have been collected in this outbreak until now as additional information becomes available it will be possible to estimate the risk of outbreaks in new locations with more precision we made the assumption that symptom appearance coincides with the onset of infectiousness one of the features of the sars outbreak in 20022003 that allowed it to eventually be brought under control was the low proportion of onward transmissions occurring either prior to symptoms or from asymptomatic infectious hosts 26 it might be hoped that infections due to the 2019-ncov share this characteristic some reports have suggested that this may not be the case although the extent of presymptomatic transmission is disputed 2527 we are working on an updated version of our analyses that includes the possibility of transmission from presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic hosts based on the seair compartmental model 19since our results were obtained using patient data from early in the ongoing outbreak surveillance systems may not have been fully established when these data were collected and patients may not have been primed to respond quickly to early symptoms our results might therefore be viewed as an upper bound on the risk posed by the 2019-ncov as the outbreak continues it might be expected that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation or isolation will decrease leading to lower risks of sustained transmission as has been observed for outbreaks of other diseases eg the ongoing outbreak of ebola virus disease in the democratic republic of the congo initial indications suggest that such a decrease is occurring in china for this outbreak in contrast there may be some individuals that developed symptoms but had not yet reported their infection by the time our analysis was conducted right censoring in this way favours lower reporting times and so falsely reduces estimates of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation 1628going forwards it will be possible to include additional realism in the model one example might be to consider spatial variation in host population densities and surveillance levels leading to spatially inhomogeneous outbreak risks another possibility might be to account more explicitly for heterogeneities between different infectors either by incorporating superspreaders 29 in the model or by differentiating between individuals that report disease at different rates such heterogeneity might be expected to reduce the risk of sustained transmission for a preliminary analysis in which individuals can either be fast reporters or slow reporters see the supplementary text it would also be possible to differentiate between mild and severe cases in the model on the one hand a mild case might be more likely to go unnoticed than a severe case potentially leading to a higher outbreak risk on the other hand mild infections may generate fewer secondary cases than severe infections thereby decreasing the outbreak risk complex interactions may therefore affect the risk of sustained transmission in an unpredictable fashiondespite the necessary simplifications made in this study our analyses are sufficient to demonstrate the key principle that rigorous surveillance is important to minimise the risk of the 2019-ncov generating large outbreaks in countries worldwide we therefore support the ongoing work of the world health organization and policy makers from around the world who are working with researchers and public health experts to manage this outbreak 2 we also appreciate efforts to make data publicly available 15 careful analysis of the outbreak as well as minimisation of transmission risk as much as possible is of clear public health importancein december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in wuhan hubei province china the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc isolated the causative viral pathogen from throat swabs sample of the affected patients the pathogen was a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by who and the disease caused by sars-cov-2 was termed as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 up to february 18 2020 58097 laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 and 1870 deaths have been reported in china posing great threats to global public healthsars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov ksiazek et al 2003 k kuiken et al 2003 de groot et al 2013 are subgroups of betacoronavirus genus as far as we known the symptoms of covid-19 range from mild to severe they can be fever dry cough shortness of breath and in some severe cases kidney failure or death similar to sars-cov infection may occur huang et al 2020 however information regarding to the radiological and clinical features of the pneumonia associated with covid-19 is still scarce making it difficult for physicians to distinguish the causative agents without genetic related laboratory analysis moreover reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr the gold standard for a confirmative diagnosis of covid-19 has some limitations such as certain proportion of false negative results limited sampling method and shortage of kits computed tomography ct of the chest is increasingly recognized as strong evidence for early diagnosis because the changes in chest imaging sometimes maybe earlier than clinical symptoms considering that fewer confirmed cases were included in previous studies chung et al 2020 we set up a jiangsu multi-center study to collect a considerable larger sample size in this retrospective study the purpose of the study is to improve the comprehension of the newly-emerged diseases in order to make the diagnosis earlier by describing the comprehensive chest ct characteristics and clinical features of patients with covid-19 who were admitted to the designated hospitals in jiangsu province chinathis study was conducted in accordance with the amended declaration of helsinki independent ethics committees approved the protocol and written informed consent was obtained from all patients this was a multi-centered study included 234 inpatients from 13 hospitals during 17 days from january 10th to february 7th 2020 in jiangsu all the cases were confirmed with the criteria for sars-cov-2 infection established by national health commission which was consistent with one of the following two conditions based on the pathogenic evidence 1 positive in real-time fluorescent rt-pcr detection of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in specimens from respiratory tract or blood 2 virus was highly homologous to the known novel coronavirus in genetic sequencing analyses in specimens from respiratory tract or blood all the cases underwent an additional microbiological evaluation for ruling out other suspected respiratory

and pericardial effusion3quantified evaluationthe signs of ground-glass opacity ggo consolidation fibrosis and air trapping were analyzed quantitatively using a radiologic scoring system ranging from 0-25 points which was an adaptation of the method previously used to describe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and sars ng et al 2004 each lung lobe was evaluated by 0-5 points on the basis of the area involved with score 0 for normal performance 1 for less than 5 of lung lobe areas involved 2 for 625 3 for 2650 4 for 5175 and 5 for more than 75 a total score was eventually recorded via the addition of the score of each lobe4ct stagesaccording to the performances of ct images the cases were classified into four stagesstage i early stage stage ii progressive stage stage iii recovery stage and stage iv severe stage the classification method was mainly according to the following ct performances stage i single or multiple lesions in irregular round-like or patchy shapes generally not involved the whole lung segment often showed ggo with vascular enlargement stage ii more extensive lesions involved bilateral multiple lobes predominantly in the sub-pleural areas in irregular round-like patchy and anti-butterfly shapes scattered or diffused patches even fusing into large patches with density increased often with vascular enlargement reticular sign and bronchial wall thickening occasionally with less fibrosis and sub-segment atelectasis stage iii the lesions absorbed and diminished the focus can be completely absorbed with residual fiber stripes stage iv bilateral diffuse lesions more than half of the lung field involved even extended to the whole lung and presented as white lung
the statistical analyses were performed by statistical product and service software spss ver 260 chicago il usa descriptive statistics was used in clinical data and some basic information of ct images pearson chi-square test and fisher exact probability test were used in dichotomous variables 0 or 1 to test the differences of these variables among different ct stages groups kruskalwallis h test was used to test the group differences of multiple quantitative variables arterial blood gas abg analysis results and ct scoring spearman rank correlation was used to measure the degree of association between the abganalysis results and ct scoring a p value less than 005 was considered statistically significant and bonferroni correction was used to adjust p values in multiple comparisons the mean values were showed as mean  se234 patients infected with sars-cov-2 confirmed by real time rt-pcr were included in this study among which 6 patients were with initial rt-pcr negative and follow-up test positive there were 136 581 men and 98 419 women with average age 446  148 years old ranging from 7 to 82 years old the age and occupation distribution of the patients were showed in table 1

the sars-cov-2 infection is recognized as a global health hazard the disease is highly infectious it is suspected that infection is transmitted by means of large-particle respiratory droplets produced by coughing or touch contamination hence good respiratory and hand hygiene is important swerdlow 2020a greater number of men 581 136234 was found than that of women 419 98234 which was similar to previous studies chen et al 2020 the reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections might be attributed to the protection from x chromosome and sex hormones which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity jaillon et al 2019 almost 90 patients in present study were classified as common type fever and cough were main symptoms however some patients presented initially with atypical symptoms such as diarrhea nausea and vomiting a large proportion of patients were with normal blood routine examination up to february 18 2020 a total of 629 covid-19 confirmed cases had been reported without death in jiangsu province compared to hubei province 59989 cases with 1789 death most cases in jiangsu were with mild clinical symptoms and approximately 90 patients had epidemiologic linkage to hubei province or closely contacted with other confirmed cases in present study suggesting that the virus might mutate to produce the first generation the second generation and so on with the longer the mutation time the lower the toxicity as the mers-cov poletto and colizza 2016 drosten et al 2014 because of the relatively lower toxicity clinical symptoms are slight and the prognosis is relatively goodas sars-cov-2 is highly contagious and with a high incidence early detection is of great importance chest hrct is a critical screening method for covid-19 due to its high sensitivity and convenience although 15 patients with covid-19 were without abnormal lung changes on initial ct images in present study additionally 6 patients were with pneumonia detected by hrct but initial rt-pcr was negative with follow-up test positive these results suggested that both chest hrct examination and rt-pcr detection of novel coronavirus nucleic acid had limitations which inevitably lead to false-negative in the follow-up of the initial negative ct cases pneumonia would be emerged in some patients while the initial negative rt-pcr cases would be emerged with positive outcomes after redetection for one time or more than once it suggestedthe critical importance to combine the two methods in the early stage of the disease to exclude the sars-cov-2 infectionthere were some typical findings on ct images the abnormal attenuations were highly frequently located in bilateral multiple lung lobes and distributed in the lower andor periphery of the lungs with the shape of irregular small patches strip-like round-like and anti-butterfly ves was the most frequent sign followed by interlobular septal thickening air bronchus sign intralesional andor perilesional bronchiectasis pleural thickening solid nodules reticularmosaic sign etc these ct performances of covid-19 were similar to previous studies chung et al 2020 noval coronavirus 2020 in addition a few cases of mediastinal lymph node enlargement pleural effusion and pericardial effusion were found in present study which were not reported yet it might be due to the relatively small sample size of previous study furthermore there were group differences of some ct signs among different ct stages though ggos and ves sign were most frequently seen in each ct stages without group differences in patients with covid-19 pneumonia in the early stage interlobular septal thickening air bronchus sign intralesional andor perilesional bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening were less seen than that in progressive stage the reticular sign pleural thickening and interlobar fissure displacement were not common in early stage the frequency of pleural effusion pericardial effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was relatively small the quantified evaluation of ct images demonstrated that consolidation fibrosis and air trapping were minor in the early stage these results suggested that each ct stage had its characteristic ct signs and performances making it possible to radiologists and physicians to quickly obtained the stage of the pneumoniaas to the abg results the spo2 and oi decreased in patients with severe stage than early or progressed stage which were in consistence with the alteration of indices in patients with severe or critical severe clinical type in the severe stage of ct the bilateral diffuse parenchymal abnormalities were mainly ggo lesions with consolidation fibrosis and air trapping it might demonstrate the severity of pulmonary dysfunction caused by sars-cov-2 infection while the fibrosis score was higher in the recovery stage which might indicate an improvement of the disease and a weak positive relevance was found between the fibrosis score and abg indices pao2 and spo2 that was a patient with higher fibrosis score tended to have better abg results suggesting that fibrosis score might be a potential index in the prognosis of the diseasethere were several limitations in this study first the patients underwent the ct scans with different machine type due to the multiple centers in the study the heterogeneity of the ct data might affect the results of the study second none of the patients underwent a lung biopsy or autopsy because of the comparatively better outcomes of the patients in this study therefore the ct findings of the lung could not be verified by histopathology finally this was a retrospective study with initial ct images during hospitalization mainly demonstrated the early pulmonary lesions in patients with covid-19 a further longitudinal research was needed to focus on the long-term follow-up to provide dynamic ct evaluation for pulmonary lesions and to obtain the data of long-term pulmonary function changesin conclusion clinical performances of patients with covid-19 mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the covid-19 while chest hrct provided the distribution shape attenuation and extent of lung lesions as well as some typical ct signs of covid-19 pneumoniaindependent ethics committees approved the protocol and the approval number was

 on 7 january 2020 chinese authorities confirmed that the cause was a novel coronavirus that had not been previously identified different from other coronaviruses such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov in 2012 to 2015 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov in 2003 on 12 january 2020 the world health organization who temporarily named this new virus 2019 novel coronavirus 2019ncov with the spread of the disease novel coronavirus cases have been found in other parts of china and other countries in the world as an ongoing coronavirus outbreak the chinese government has paid great attention to this situation on 21 january 2020 the national health commission of the peoples republic of china announced 2019ncov pneumonia as a category b infectious disease and preventive and control measures were taken according to category a infectious diseaseon 30 january 2020 the who declared that the 2019ncov epidemic constitutes a public health emergency of international concern soon after that the novel coronavirusinfected pneumonia was officially named covid19 coronavirus disease 2019 by the who on 11 february 2020 at the same time the international virus classification commission announced that the novel coronavirus was named sarscov2 with the development of pathogenic testing and the continuous accumulation of clinical cases people have acquired a certain degree of knowledge and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease this article presents the currently known epidemiological characteristics clinical manifestations laboratory findings and experiences in the prevention and treatment of covid19 providing references for the prevention and treatment of this diseasesarscov2 is the seventh type of coronavirus isolated in humans this coronavirus belongs to the genus  and has an envelope its particles are round or oval often polymorphic and 60 to 140 nm in diameter the genetic characteristics of sarscov2 are significantly different from those of sarscov and merscov current research shows that sarscov2 has more than 85 homology with bat sarslike coronavirus batslcov zc45
2
 therefore it is now believed that the original host of sarscov2 may have been rhinolophus sinicus
3
 a study team from south china agricultural university pointed out that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts of sarscov2 through which the virus may spread to humans relevant research teams are being organized by the chinese government to further support this view the outbreak is considered to be closely related to wuhans huanan wholesale seafood market
4
 
5
 
6
 
7
 epidemiological surveys have shown that 27 of 41 people with the earliest onset have visited the market
8
 post hoc investigations also revealed that there was a wildlife trade in this market and sarscov2 has also been isolated from the markets environment humantohuman transmission emerged shortly thereafter
9
 patients with covid19 have become the main source of infection covid19 may be capable of transmission during the incubation period
10
 
11
 these patients are difficult to diagnose and isolate in time which causes great difficulties in the prevention and control of the disease however up to date there is no enough evidence to support the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of covid19 in addition the presence of the virus can be detected in patients during the recovery stage especially in fecal specimens requiring longer detoxification times indicating the possible risk of fecaloral transmission
11
 sarscov2 is a positivestranded rna virus that is susceptible to gene mutation and recombination but so far no significant mutations have been found in humans or the environment
2
 
12

at present droplets inhaled into the respiratory tract and contact transmission are considered to be the most important routes of transmission there is no direct evidence showing that covid19 can be transmitted through aerosols the who believes that further evidence is needed to assess the possibility of aerosol transmission however some of the observations suggest that aerosol propagation is possible under the condition of long exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment in the early stages of the outbreak of sarscov2 pneumonia it is uncertain whether stool samples from patients are infectious however lu et al
2
 using a computer structural simulation found that the sprotein of sarscov2 can bind to human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 in the spatial conformation after that letko et al
13
 synthesized the sprotein of sars and the receptorbinding domain rbd of sarscov2 in vitro and reacted with known human coronavirus receptors respectively as a result the rbd of sarscov2 is similar to the s protein in sars and it can directly bind to human ace2 ace2 is a metalloproteinase belonging to a type i transmembrane glycoprotein and it can be expressed in the small intestine
14
 
15
 in our laboratory it was also found that nucleic acid amplification testing of stool samples can still be positive for a long time after oral swab samples become negative in addition a large number of clinical studies have shown that a certain proportion of sarscov2 pneumonia patients develop symptoms of diarrhea
10
 
16
 it can be concluded that during the development of the disease there is a greater possibility of the virus in the stool recently sarscov2 has been isolated from the stool of confirmed patients in wuhan and shenzhen china and in the united states
17
 indicating that the virus can replicate and survive in the digestive tract however it is not clear whether the infection and transmission are caused by eating food contaminated with the virus through the analysis of the current epidemic situation some scholars believe that viruses in feces may be retransmitted by the aerosol formation of viruscontaining droplets sarscov2 also has adverse effects on fetuses and infants including restricted intrauterine growth premature birth spontaneous abortion and perinatal death
18
 however the possibility of intrauterine mothertochild transmission of covid19 is very low and neither of the two existing retrospective clinical studies have found direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission
19
 
20

covid19 is an emerging infectious disease so the population is not immune and is generally susceptible a report
16
 delineated 1099 patients with sarscov2 pneumonia from 552 hospitals in 31 provincesprovincelevel municipalities of china and found that the median age was 470 years old interquartile range iqr 350580 and that 419 of patients were females sarscov2 pneumonia was diagnosed throughout the whole spectrum of age a total of 09 of patients were aged below 15 years old another chinese analysis of 4021 confirmed cases showed that people of all ages were generally susceptible the study found that 7145 of patients were 30 to 65 years old and children under 10 years old accounted for 035
21
 those in close contact with patients with sarscov2 pneumonia including the family members of patients are at high risk for developing the sarscov2 infection medical staff who treat patients also have a high risk of infection nine percent of the patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university from 1 to 28 january 2020 were the medical staff
22
 by the end of 29 january 2020 survey data from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces in china showed that the infection rate of medical staff was as high as 209
16

according to a who report as of 23 march 2020 the world has reported 332 930 confirmed cases of covid19 including 81 601 cases in china and 251 329 cases in other countries outside china the average mortality rate in china was 40 327681 601 while the average mortality rate outside china was 45 11 233251 329 hubei province the worstaffected province in china had an average mortality rate of 47 316067 801 the area in hubei province with higherthanaverage mortality rates in hubei province was wuhan 50 252450 006the mortality rates in other severely affected provinces in china were relatively lower than those in hubei province with mortality rates of 06 81428 in guangdong 17 221274 in henan 01 11240 in zhejiang and 04 41018 in hunan the above results are shown in figures 1 2 3 according to the available data the mortality rate of covid19 in china is lower than those of sars 10

 and mers 40
24
 by 23 march 2020 965 31603276 of the deaths caused by sarscov2 pneumonia in china was in hubei province and the earlier the onset of disease was the higher the mortality rate suggesting that the pathogenicity may gradually decrease as the virus spreads which may also occur because of the improving ability of medical staff to diagnose and treat the disease the national health commission of china notified on 4 february 2020 that the population is generally susceptible to the virus and more than 80 of the deaths are elderly people over 60 years old at the same time more than 75 of the deaths have underlying diseases overall men are linked to a higher risk of death the specific data in this section are shown in table 1a singlecentered retrospective observational study from one hospital of wuhan

 found among 52 critically ill patients with sarscov2 infection 32 615 patients had died at 28 days and the median duration from intensive care unit admission to death was 7 iqr 311 days in the nonsurvivors compared with survivors nonsurvivors were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 26 81 vs 9 45 and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation 30 94 vs 7 35 a total of 30 81 of 37 patients requiring mechanical ventilation had died by 28 daysaccording to the data

 by 11 february 2020 among the 422 medical institutions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of sarscov2 pneumonia in china a total of 1716 medical workers were diagnosed with confirmed sarscov2 pneumonia among the 1688 confirmed cases with severity grading data 873 14741688 of the infected medical staff were in hubei province and 104 of the infected medical staff were seriously ill a total of 640 10801688 of new coronavirus infections among medical workers occurred in wuhan and the proportion of critically ill patients was 177 medical workers in other parts of china accounted for 127 2141688 with a proportion of critically ill patients of 70 the proportion of critically ill patients among medical workers in wuhan has gradually decreased from a peak of 389 to 127 by early february 2020 the average mortality rate for the 1688 diagnosed medical staff was 03the spread of sarscov2 pneumonia in china can be roughly divided into three stages 55 of the patients who developed symptoms before the end of december 2019 are related to the exposure at wuhans huanan wholesale seafood market therefore the first stage of epidemic transmission mainly occurred in a local outbreak among people with a direct contact history at the seafood market only 86 of the patients who became ill after 1 january 2020 had a history of exposure to wuhans huanan wholesale seafood market suggesting that the epidemic of sarscov2 pneumonia had now shifted to the second stage the community dissemination stage
31
 interpersonal and cluster transmission occurred in multiple communities and families in wuhan during this period

25 january 2020 was chinese new year also known as the spring festival which is the most important festival in china with the festival approaching a large number of migrant workers and people new to wuhan began to leave wuhan to travel to their hometowns in other provinces in china for family reunions or to start a vacation in other countries with the movement of people the epidemic quickly spread to other parts of china and other countries around the world and reached the stage of largescale transmission causing widespread concern in the international community
32
 
33

a retrospective study of 425 patients with sarscov2 pneumonia at the beginning of the epidemic before 22 january 2020 found that the average incubation period of the disease was 52 days 95 confidence interval 4170 and the p95 was 125 days in the early stages the epidemic doubling time was 74 days which means the number of infections doubled every 74 days the r0 was estimated to be 22 which means infecting two healthy people for every sick person
31
 additionally the who assessed the r0 of this epidemic as between 14 and 25
7

at the beginning of the outbreak the average time from onset to the first visit and the average time from onset to hospitalization was 58 and 125 days respectively for patients who developed the disease before 1 january 2020 and 46 and 91 days respectively for patients who developed disease between 1 and 11 january 2020
31
 a retrospective analysis of approximately 4021 confirmed sarscov2 pneumonia patients from various regions in china found that the average time from onset to confirmed diagnosis was 5 days and this time window was getting shorter as the epidemic progresses
21
 the confirmed times for patients who developed the disease before 14 january during 14 to 22 january and after 22 january were 14 6 and 1 day respectivelythis shows that with the development of the epidemic situation the diagnostic ability of chinese medical staff is rapidly improving the average time from symptom onset to the hospitalization of critically ill patients was 7 days and the average time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was 8 days which was significantly longer than that of mildly ill patients the average time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis in death cases was 9 days and the average time interval from symptom onset to death was 95 days therefore early detection early diagnosis and early treatment are effective methods for reducing the severity and mortality of the disease

 the main manifestations of sarscov2 pneumonia patients were fever 896 15631745 and dry cough 670 11701745 additionally a small number of patients had symptoms such as the stuffy nose runny nose sore throat myalgia and diarrhea a total of 902 11571283 of patients had normal or decreased leukocyte counts 734 9821337 of patients had decreased lymphocyte counts and 812 11191378 of patients had abnormal pulmonary imaging it can be seen that patients with sarscov2 pneumonia had a fever andor respiratory symptoms in the early stages of onset the white blood cells were normal or reduced or with lymphocytopenia the proportion of abnormalities on chest computed tomography or xray was high
34
 therefore meeting two of the above three clinical manifestations at the same time with an epidemiological history or both conforming to the above three clinical manifestations was presented as the diagnostic criteria for suspected cases in chinas guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of covid19 if the suspected case has a positive result for a nucleic acid amplification assay or serological evidence immunoglobulin m igm antibody specific to sarscov2 was detected 35 days after onset or the titer of igg antibody specific to sarscov2 was increased by four times or more in the recovery period compared with the acute phase the case can be classified as confirmed according to statistics the proportion of critically ill patients among the confirmed cases is approximately 234 11985120

21
 the above results are shown in table 1 most of the 14 cases in children reported in the existing literature table 2 had an epidemiological history related to wuhan and almost all had family members that were confirmed patients except for one child who failed to see a doctor in time the others were all in mild condition among the seven cases reported in the existing literature outside china except for one case where the patient died the remaining cases were in stable condition table 3according to the latest data as of 23 march 2020 more than 73 159 patients with sarscov2 pneumonia have recovered and been discharged hubei and wuhan reported no new confirmed or suspected cases for 5 consecutive days and the number of confirmed cases continued to drop these results indicate that chinas preventions and treatments against covid19 have achieved good results in the past month or so china has issued a series of national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections caused by sarscov2
45
 these recommendations have now been updated to version 7 recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection caused by sarscov2 in children were also drafted by the national clinical research center for child health childrens hospital zhejiang university school of medicine to further standardize the protocol for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection in children caused by sarscov2
46
 chinese medical workers have gradually formed some effective diagnosis and treatment strategies and methods in clinical practice of antiviral therapy and symptomatic treatment including a comprehensive series of diagnosis and treatment methods such as respiratory support circulatory support and immunity improvement to accelerate recovery
47
 antiviral drugs ganciclovir acyclovir and ribavirin and neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir paramivir zanamivir etc commonly used in clinical practice are ineffective on covid19 and are not recommended drugs that are possibly effective on covid19 include remdesivir lopinavirritonavir lopinavirritonavir combined with interferon convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies
48
 however the efficacy and safety of these drugs for sarscov2 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials chinese researchers recently discovered that the antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate has an effect on the treatment of sarscov2 pneumonia through drug screening and clinical trials preliminary evidence suggests that chloroquine phosphate can significantly reduce the exacerbation rate of patients with sarscov2 pneumonia has an antipyretic function can accelerate pulmonary inflammation recovery shorten the negative time and increase the negative conversion rate of viral nucleic acids and shorten the course of the disease in addition chloroquine phosphate is relatively safe and no serious adverse reactions related to the drug have been found so far the drug has been included in the latest edition of the chinese diagnosis and treatment guidelines for sarscov2 pneumonia treatment updated on 3 march 2020 to expand the scope of clinical trials however the efficacy of this drug should be further evaluated in clinical application use should be discontinued when there is an intolerable side effect patients with covid19 treated with chloroquine phosphate must have a normal electrocardiogram before medication the combination uses chloroquine phosphate with macrolides including azithromycin or other drugs that may cause a prolonged qt interval are prohibited in china however a study from france showed that azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination in covid19 patients in this study among hydroxychloroquinetreated patients six patients received azithromycin to prevent bacterial superinfection under daily electrocardiogram control 100 of patients were virologicaly cured
49
 although the study sample size was small the results require further confirmation however the study offers an insight whether this compound could be useful as chemoprophylaxis to prevent the transmission of the virus especially for health care workersthe principle of treatment for severe and critically ill cases is to actively prevent and treat complications treat underlying diseases prevent infection and provide timely organ function support based on symptomatic treatment clinical warning indicators and early intervention for patients were explored to reduce mortality additionally new treatments such as convalescent plasma therapy were developed the convalescent plasma therapy was developed using a virusfree plasma containing hightiter sarscov2 specific antibodies donated from rehabilitated patients this therapy will be applied clinically after virus inactivation antibody titer determination and multiple pathogenic microorganism determination on 22 january the chinese research group incorporated the preparation of exempt plasma from rehabilitated sarscov2 pneumonia patients into the scientific research emergency project the first plasma from patients with a recovery period was collected on 1 february 2020 and coronavirusfree plasma was then prepared on 9 february 2020 the first severely ill patient received sarscov2free plasma treatment at a hospital in wuhan and more patients subsequently received the therapy clinical studies have shown that sarscov2free plasma is safe and effective for critically ill patients the therapeutic method has been added to the latest guidelines version 6 for critically ill patients in addition china has organized several research groups to explore the role of chinese medicine in the prevention and treatment of covid19 and has achieved a certain effectzhejiang province is one of the provinces with the largest number of sarscov2 pneumonia patients in china as of 23 march 2020 a total of 1240 patients with sarscov2 pneumonia were diagnosed of which 1193 recovered and were discharged the most important thing is that to date only one patient has died from sarscov2 infection in this province the medical staff in this province have formed a unique zhejiang experience a within 72 hours of disease onset a combination of lopinavirritonavirabidol and interferon nebulization is used for antiviral treatment to reduce the damage to the cells caused by viral expansion and replication b glucocorticoids are mainly used in critically ill patients suffering inflammatory cytokine storm inhibition of excessive inflammation through timely administration of glucocorticoids in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occurrence of ards and protects the functions of the patients organs for patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators rapid imaging progress and excessive inflammatory response the use of glucocorticoid in the short term 35 days is appropriate and the recommended dose is no more than equivalent to methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mgkgd some critically ill patients should use methods such as artificial liver and plasma exchange to block the cytokine storm c effective oxygen therapy is performed for patients d infection is actively prevented e nutritional support is strengthenedin clinical practice some mild patients can quickly progress to critical patients some characteristics of these patients were summarized in the diagnosis and treatment of covid19 trial version 7 from china in adults the following conditions indicate a worsening of the disease a progressive decline of peripheral blood lymphocytes b peripheral inflammatory factors such as interleukin 6 and creactive protein increased progressively c progressive increase of lactic acid d intrapulmonary lesions progress rapidly in a short period of timechildren with the following conditions are prone to develop into critical cases a increased respiratory rate b poor mental response and lethargy c progressive increase of lactic acid d imaging findings showed bilateral or multilobular infiltration pleural effusion or rapid progression in the short term e infants under 3 months of age or have underlying diseases congenital heart disease pulmonary dysplasia of the airway malformation of the respiratory tract abnormal hemoglobin severe malnutrition etc or have immunodeficiency longterm use of immunosuppressive agentsafter treatment covid19 patients can be discharged if they meet the following conditions temperature returns to normal for more than 3 days respiratory symptoms improve significantly pulmonary imaging shows significant improvement of acute exudative lesions negative nucleic acid test of respiratory tract specimens such as sputum and nasopharyngeal swab for two consecutive times sampling time should be at least 24 hours apart however it is now found that about 01 of patients will be tested positive for nucleic acid again after discharge
50
 there are many reasons for the positive nucleic acid test of discharged patients
51
 the reagent itself detection method sampling method and so on will affect the positive rate in addition the possibility of disease recurrence cannot be ruled out too genomic analysis of the virus from different regions different periods and different sources of patients revealed that sarscov2 was stable and showed no major variation so once the patient is cured with immunity against the virus there is little chance of reinfection the detection of sarscov2 specific igm and igg antibodies is an effective means to determine whether a patient has immunity against sarscov2 but these patients still have the potential to infect others therefore after the patient is discharged from the hospital it is recommended to continue the isolation management and health condition monitoring for 14 days here are some tips and considerations for selfisolation wear a mask live in a single room with good ventilation reduce close contact with family members separate meals good hand hygiene and avoid outdoor activities it is also recommended to visit the hospital for reexamination on the 14th and 28th days after dischargein the early stages of the epidemic the chinese government adopted the principles of four early and four centralization to address the epidemic so that the epidemic situation was effectively controlled the socalled four early principle is early detection early reporting early isolation and early treatment early detection and isolation of sarscov2infected people moving the prevention and control barrier forward accelerating the gridbased management of the community improving detection capabilities optimizing the diagnosis and treatment process and shortening the diagnosis time can effectively block the spread of the epidemic and reduce the infection rate the principle of four centralization is to centralize patients centralize experts centralize resources and centralize treatment patients with severe illness are centralized at the best hospital with the strongest comprehensive capacity for treatment at the same time to centralize resources and experts to treat critically ill patients multidisciplinary and comprehensive individualized diagnosis and treatment are applied in accordance with one person one strategy and finally the mortality rate is effectively reducedin addition more than 37 000 medical staff from other parts of china participated in the treatment of patients with sarscov2 pneumonia in wuhan hubei which fully reflects the noble qualities and good professionalism of chinese medical staffit has not been long since the occurrence of sarscov2 pneumonia there are relatively few reports in the literature and some opinions need to be further verified by multicenter big data in addition infectious diseases have different characteristics at different stages whether some of the findings and opinions have always been applicable needs further evaluationthe sarscov2 originated from the huanan seafood market in wuhan with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts the current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with sarscov2 patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection covid19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact and the population is generally susceptible the epidemic has experienced the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage caused by the wuhans huanan wholesale seafood market exposure and is now in the stage of largescale transmission caused by the spread of the epidemic the r0 at the beginning of the epidemic was 22 with an average incubation period of 52 days the proportion of critically ill patients was 234 the mortality was lower than those of sars and mers and 965 of the deaths occurred in hubei province where the outbreak first occurred among them elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate in the process of fighting against the covid19 chinese

of cases displaying the symptoms of a pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in wuhan hubei province china 1 further investigations found that these cases were linked to huanan seafood wholesale market the wuhan pneumonia cluster rapidly spread across the globe with initial reports of cases in thailand japan and korea 2 the world health organization who subsequently declared covid-19 then named 2019-ncov outbreak a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30th january 2020 by then there were 7818 covid-19 cases reported worldwide with 7736 cases from china and 82 cases from 18 other countries 3the novel coronavirus research team in china identified and characterized the causal pathogen which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 4 studies have shown that the novel pathogen bears similarity to two other global threats sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov as it belongs to the same family of viruses 4 5 sars-cov-2 shares 79 sequence identity with sars-cov and 50 with mers-cov 6 this resemblance has key implications on how covid-19 manifests in affected individuals and experience with mers and sars can help guide researchers and authorities in tackling covid-19 7with the progression of the outbreak into a pandemic health authorities have realized that community transmission of covid-19 is becoming more difficult to avoid 8 instead the focus has been to ensure that health systems are able to cope with covid-19 hospitalizations and that vulnerable populations prone to the severe effects of covid-19 receive appropriate supportive care 9even as numbers have dropped in china while other regions like europe have become new epicenters of the pandemic 10 there is still limited knowledge on the risk factors and severity of covid-19 11 this systematic review primarily aims to review the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cases admitted to hospitals for covid-19 at the early phase of the pandemic moreover this review will examine the potential differences between cases who were admitted to icu and those who werenta systematic search was conducted with three databasespubmed google scholar and china knowledge resource integrated cnki database according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines figure 1 and checklist figure s1 keywords such as 2019-ncov 2019 novel coronavirus ncov   and wuhan pneumonia were used in the search to identify articles published on or before 11th february 2020 in english or chinese the cut-off date was aimed to coincide with the announcement of covid-19 as a pheic by the who and also the early phase of the pandemic this date coincided with the official naming of disease as covid-19 and hence this term was not included in the search the publications were imported and managed in endnotex9 inclusion criteria for the studies was based on the picos framework table s1 the studies excluded in this review were preprints editorials news articles or reviews of selected articles we included brief reports and correspondences for this systematic reviewthree reviewers

characteristics only studies with acceptable risk of bias and adult populations were included in the meta-analysisa total of 800 studies were obtained from search results and 593 were reviewed after excluding 207 duplicates an additional seven studies were found from other sources the title and abstracts of 600 studies were screened according to the eligibility criteria five hundered twenty-two studies did not meet the eligibility criteria and were excluded figure 1 and 78 articles were shortlisted for full text screening after reviewing the full text a total of 29 publications were included

specifying the cut-off date for data reporting figure s2 seven of the 18 case reports were of unacceptable risk of bias mostly due to lack of explanation of how patients were selected and unstandardized reporting of patient variables amongst the casesacross the 11 case series and cross-sectional studies selected from full-text review there were different proportions of case

fatal cases were featured in the 23 patients from selected case reports table s7the novel pathogen sars-cov-2 is increasingly infecting more susceptible individuals resulting in the spread of coronavirus disease covid-19 around the world 36 however there is still limited knowledge in the key characteristics of populations-at-risk including the clinical presentation and severity of patients during the early phase of this pandemic among several hypotheses about the disease one postulation is that individuals infected by sars-cov-2 during the early phase of this pandemic had more severe outcomes 37as of 11th february there was still a scarcity of literature published on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients out of 10 selected studies with adult patients all from china subjects were primarily hospitalized covid-19 cases with pneumonia at least 508 out of 533 covid-19 positive cases these numbers are not representative of the disease spectrum as only patients with severe symptoms were more likely to seek medical attention at hospitals with the chinese cdc estimating that 81 of covid-19 cases had no pneumonia in actuality 38the pooled median age of 56 among patients 95 ci 4957 434 out of 451 adult patients with data had pneumonia in our meta-analysis was consistent with understanding that older patients are more vulnerable to covid-19 pneumonia 39 this was also reflected in the lower prevalence of symptoms at admission amongst covid-19-infected children at wuhan childrens hospital 29 it has been proposed that older patients have weakened innate immunity accompanied by an over-reactive adaptive immune system induced by sars-cov-2 which leads to inflammatory responses like the cytokine storm causing complications including pneumonitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 40 conversely the innate immunity in children appears to block the viral invasion at the mucosal level resulting in minimal to no symptoms even as their adaptive immunity are relatively undeveloped 41 however this requires further investigationthis age distribution is similar to mers-cov which has been observed to affect children less compared to adults 42 a global study on the epidemiology of mers-cov in 20122013 reported that the median age of 161 infected patients was 50 years range from 14 months to 94 years 43 conversely sars-cov tends to infect younger individuals in china with a median age of 33 44amongst the 10 studies selected for meta-analysis there was a 60 pooled prevalence of male patients on the other hand a february report by the who-china joint mission on covid-19 found that 511 of 55924 laboratory-confirmed infections were male this discrepancy maybe due to selected studies focus on pneumonia cases as studies have shown that males tend to experience worse outcomes in covid-19 infections compared to females 45 in contrast who figures on mers-cov from affected countries worldwide showed that males made up 64 of cases 43 however sars-cov has shown a different gender ratio in china 49 of the cases were female 46 while singapore and vietnam reported higher percentages of affected females 676 and 629 respectively 47 48 the gender difference in these areas was attributed to the fact that hospital transmission of sars occurred more in the latter two countries 44at least 45 of cases in our pooled patient population which consisted predominantly of pneumonia cases had existing comorbidities at admission the most prevalent comorbidities were diabetes hypertension and cardiovascular disease the who-china joint mission on covid-19 also reported that chinese patients with comorbidities had higher case fatality rates 132 with cardiovascular disease 92 with diabetes 84 with hypertension 80 with chronic respiratory disease 49 hypertension copd and cardiovascular disease were also more common among icu patients compared to non-icu patients laboratory studies suggested this may be mediated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 which the virus spike proteins bind to and is highly expressed in the heart and lungs 50 this increases the likelihood of more severe complications such as acute lung injury and acute myocarditis during covid-19 infection among individuals with these existing comorbiditiesin the case of sars a review of studies across the world showed that pre-existing diabetes was a prognostic factor for worse outcomes 51 conversely the 20122013 global mers-cov study found that fatal mers-cov infections had a higher proportion of chronic kidney failure 208 compared to recoveredasymptomatic cases 61 43from our pooled results the common symptoms presented at admission were consistent with another study comprising of 1099 covid-19 patients 911 with pneumonia diagnosis across 552 chinese hospitals up till january 29th 2020 52 patients in guan et als study reported fever 438 cough 678 and fatigue 381 at admission in comparison this studys population had a pooled prevalence of 90 58 and 50 for fever cough and fatigue respectively in guan et al s study vomiting 5 and diarrhea 38 were also less common 52 this finding was consistent in our pooled results 4 vomiting and 8 diarrhea there are potential implications in active surveillance and triage if infected cases present with either cough only fatigue only or diarrhea only from our wide spectrum review of the clinical symptoms sore throat or pharyngodynia was not a rare symptom at admission with pooled prevalence of 7 95 ci 115 this observation is similar to other studies which reported 124 and 139 during presentation 5355 this shows that sore throat should also be one of the clinical criteria taken into consideration during triage of suspected cases for further assessment olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as a clinical presentation was reported among european american and iranians 56 57 however these were not reported or observed among the chinese patients during the early phase of the pandemic this may be due to a few reasons first the differences could be due to a lack of awareness among the healthcare workers in the population to look out for such symptoms because these symptoms were also not known to be specific resulting in lack of data among the chinese patients second the differences could be due to the fact that olfactory disorder may appear before the rest of the complaints as observed in 118 of cases 57 third this may be due to differences in genetic and physiological background between these populations and asians lastly the differences may be due to the different viral strains that circulated in these different regions 58with sars the most prominent symptoms on admission are cough malaise headache and fever according to a review on the global 20022003 epidemic 59 in a study comparing sars with covid-19 it was reported that symptoms for covid-19 are similar to sars 60 for mers-cov infections observed in 47 pneumonic patients from saudi arabia common symptoms at presentation included fever 98 cough 83 shortness of breath 72 and myalgia 32 gastrointestinal symptoms were also more frequent including diarrhea 26 vomiting 21 and abdominal pain 17 61 the mers coronavirus has been known to affect gastrointestinal tract 62this reviews pooled prevalence of imaging features for at least 250 patients show that ground-glass opacity was at 59 and consolidation at 31 this is consistent with one of the largest cross-sectional imaging studies of 1014 suspected pneumonia patients in wuhan where ground-glass opacity 46 and consolidation 50 were main ct findings 63 bilateral involvement amongst this group was also about 90 in pooled analysis which is similar to another study with 1014 patients 63 in contrast the hallmark imaging features of sars tend to be unilateral at admission before becoming bilateral with maximal lung involvement 64 on the other hand the ct findings of mers-cov patients consist of more extensive ground-glass opacities than consolidation with predominantly subpleural and basilar airspace changes 65in terms of covid-19 treatment there was heterogeneity across the different studies especially with the use of invasive mechanical ventilation in wuhan hospitals in huang et als study 15 of all covid-19 patients admitted to icu received mechanical ventilation with 85 of this group experiencing ards during hospitalization 25 on the other hand wang et al reported 47 of covid-19 patients admitted to icu received mechanical ventilation even as 61 of this group experienced ards 28 this may be due to a lack of mechanical ventilators as one review estimated that only 25 of covid-19 fatalities in china were intubated and received mechanical ventilation 66 however the selected studies in this review did not make reference to challenges in resource management 25 28in selected cross-sectional studies with information on patients outcomes as of last follow-up the pooled case fatality rate cfr was 99 this stands higher than chinas cfr of 23 as of 11th february 67a result of our study population consisting predominantly of pneumonia cases by comparison the case fatality rate for mers-cov was 60 much higher than that for covid-19 61one key limitation of this study was publication bias as patients represented in this review are only a handful of patients that were reported there were limited peer-reviewed studies mainly case reports case-series and cross-sectional studies that were published as of 11th february resulting in a small study population that over-represented covid-19 pneumonia cases in order to achieve the most rigorous form of systematic review during the early phase of pandemic only peer-reviewed articles but not preprints were included since peer-reviewing process is not yet a rate-limiting step moreover heterogeneity of the studies different hospital sites and patient composition did not favor consistency in measurement of clinical variables which may result in inaccurate meta-analysis hence there is still a need to advocate for more and rapid sharing of these knowledge at the early phase of the pandemic without just focusing on the severe outcomes to guide appropriate global responses and preparedness against covid-19furthermore this review presents a cross-sectional view of covid-19 patient characteristics during the early phase of the pandemic and only 52 out of 450 patients with outcome reported were discharged at time of reporting hence outcomes of these patients such as subsequent complications icu admission and deaths could have occurred after these studies have been published and would introduce differential misclassification bias in the stratified analyses of icu admission statusnevertheless this systematic review will provide a basis for comparison of patient data between the early outbreak phase and the following monthsincluding country-level comparisons case reports presented here also provide useful information on atypical covid-infections those found in our review include severe pneumonia in a child 68 a case of asymptomatic transmission 21 and the first imported cases in countries outside of china 2224 in a nutshell this knowledge will aid in formulating better detection strategy for surveillance and containment to minimize the spread of the sars-cov-2 as more literature becomes available it would strengthen the next meta-analysis to provide a more accurate epidemiology and clinical characteristics of covid-19 globallymost eligible published literature was focused on severe outcomes at the early phase of the pandemic which may not represent the true spectrum of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 the pooled analysis identified fever cough and myalgia as the most common symptoms at admission patients with shortness of breath at admission and pre-existing comorbidities are at higher risk of severe

december 2019 a cluster of patients with unknown pneumonia was reported in wuhan hubei province china 13 after the epidemiological survey and genome sequencing analysis a novel coronavirus was identified 4 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv announced it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 5 and the world health organization who announced that the disease caused by sars-cov-2 was coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 within 2 months it had spread to different areas and countries as of february 8 2020 more than 30000 cases of laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection were reported around the world including 25 confirmed cases in the area of luoyang henan province china sars-cov-2 can cause severe respiratory illness similar to sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers and has been found to be adept at human-to-human transmission 2 6 china launched an emergency response to the outbreak and the who also declared it a public health emergency of international concern pheic in the case of sars-cov-2 there have been some clues suggesting that sometimes an individual with highly severe sars-cov-2 disease will only cause a few infections conversely individuals with a moderate disease or latent infection can occasionally cause many infections 7as a result early detection isolation and treatment are the key steps to preventing further spread of this disease according to the fifth version of the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonitis caused by the new coronavirus published by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china the sars-cov-2 laboratory-confirmation method which involves viral nucleic acid detection by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction pcr assay using nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens has shown false negatives and the detectability is still limited thus ct imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 pneumoniagiven the concept of the early diagnosis and treatment of sars-cov-2 this article mainly focused on the 25 initial laboratory-confirmed patients in the luoyang area discussing their imaging features and clinical characteristicsfrom january 10 to february 8 2020 25 patients with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection in the area of luoyang henan province china were enrolled in the study patients were diagnosed with covid-19 based on the who interim guidance 8 a patient confirmed to have sars-cov-2 was defined as a positive case according to a pcr assay using nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens 1 pcr results were obtained after a 1- to 3-day delay and were then used to identify confirmed cases of the 25 patients three had severe conditions and the others had moderate conditions ten patients underwent follow-up ct and the lung lesions of two people improved whereas eight of them gradually absorbed after experiencing consolidation changing patients were divided into three groups according to the ct scanning timing after the onset of patients symptoms group 1  7 days group 2 814 days and group 3 1421 days two of the 25 patients were cured and dischargedthe ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital college of clinical medicine medical college of henan university of science and technology approved this retrospective study the requirement for informed patient consent

male and 10 40 female patients ranging from 24 to 88 years old 52  1930 nine patients 4090 had gone to wuhan or had a history of contact with someone who had been in wuhan 13 5412 patients had a history of contact with confirmed sars-cov-2 patients or family cluster phenomena and the remaining two people had unknown causes of infection twelve patients 48 had comorbidities including diabetes 20 hypertension 20 cardiac disease 8 hepatic adipose infiltration 4 coronary disease 4 and syphilis 4 of these patients no children or adolescents were infectedthe median latent period was 9 days range 421 the median time from initial symptoms to pcr diagnosis was 7 days range 013all patients had symptoms before diagnosis 92 had respiratory symptoms and 8 had digestive symptoms as shown in table 1 fever 92 cough 60 and fatigue 56 were the most common initial symptoms and some patients had phlegm 36 dyspnea 28 and sore throat 20 symptoms a small number of patients experienced loss of appetite 12 stuffy and runny nose 8 and nausea and vomiting 4in the early stage of covid-19 the total white blood cell count wbc in the peripheral blood was normal or reduced 96 and the lymphocyte count 60 was reduced in most patients c-reactive protein crp was elevated 48 and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr was elevated 44 all patients had normal d-dimer levels in 4 and 8 of patients creatine kinase ck and ck-mb were elevated respectivelyten patients 40 had been to wuhan patients 1 2 4 5 7 11 13 14 21 and 23 and two patients 8 had a history of contact with people who had been in wuhan patients 6 and 8 a total of ten patients 40 had close contact with a confirmed patient or were infected from family members patients 9 10 12 15 18 19 20 22 24 and 25 three patients 12 stated that they did not go to wuhan or have contact with infected patientscharacteristics of 25 laboratory-confirmed patients are shown in fig 1 and most patients had abnormal ct imaging results fifteen patients underwent pcr and ct examinations before diagnosis which helped to diagnose the disease in the early stage dr had normal manifestations patients 2 4 5 6 8 12 14 18 and 23 while most ct scans revealed abnormal imaging pcr results were also negative in the early stage of the disease in patients 18 21 and 22according to ct imaging of patients in group 1 table 2 more than 50 of patients had lesions in both lungs located in the lower region that were pure ggo more than three lobes were commonly involved group 2 showed primarily ggo with consolidation while other lesion features were the same as those found in group 1 group 3 showed ggo with consolidation while other lesions were similar to those in groups 1 and 2 no pericardial or lymphadenopathy was found in our patients all three groups had lesions mainly located in the peripheral areaas shown in fig 1 in the early stage initial symptoms within 4 days of covid-19 dr was normal and resulted in a lower diagnosis rate therefore these techniques are not recommended to be used figures 2 3 4 5 and 6 show some typical and significant ct image findings in the early stage there were usually no abnormal findings on chest images or only small patchy shadows in the peripheral lung field which could be clearly observed after the progression of the disease in this stage thin patchy ggo was seen on the ct distributed along the bronchial vascular bundle as well as thickening adjacent to the bronchial wall as shown in figs 5 and 6 multiple nucleic acid assays were negative at this point while subsequent ct manifestations revealed significant lesions with progression and pcr results were also positive reflecting the positive ct results for lesions at the same time common ct performance for bilateral lung multiple patchy ground glass opacity ggo andor consolidation shadows could be accompanied by bronchial distribution of the blood vessel bundle but the major distribution was in subpleural areas part of the lesion within the fine mesh shadow halo sign or reversed halo sign could be seen in the visible edge fig 4 disease progression after the consolidation of the ggo could result in partial or complete consolidation fig 3 the lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and oblique crack regions air bronchogram signs were common in consolidation shadows the partial bronchi wall was thickened small blood vessels with fine reticular structures increased in the lesion as shown in figs 2 4 and 6 during the dissipation period lesion scope and density decreased the ggo shadow was partially or completely absorbed a partial fibrotic stripe shadow was observed in the fusion and consolidation lesions during this period the shadow in the lung did not completely disappear before the nucleic acid assay was negative fig 2ct images of three patients with serious disease showed involvement of multiple lobes even the total lobes in both lungs the affected regions were massive and involved the central and hilumherein we described the first diagnosis of 25 patients with covid-19 in the luoyang area and mainly focused on their imaging features and clinical characteristics the wuhan epidemic history was the essential clue the poor immunity of the elderly and comorbidity of people contributed to sars-cov-2 infection fever 92 cough 60 and fatigue 56 were the most common symptoms which was similar to other studies 1 6 8 9 most patients had normal or reduced wbc 96 reduced lymphocyte count 60 elevated crp 48 and elevated esr 44due to familial and social cluster infection phenomena fig 1 our study provided evidence of human-to-human transmission for example patients 10 and 19 were colleagues and had contact with confirmed covid-19 patients in shanghai while on business and patient 19 transmitted the disease to his wife when he went back to luoyang revealing cross-city transmission most patients came to the hospital because of clinical symptoms patients 3 16 and 17 as for those who had symptoms but claimed to have no wuhan epidemiology history determining whether they were infected with sars-cov-2 and establishing a clinical diagnosis was the most important issueggo was the typical chest ct findings of covid-19 patients covid-19 started from the margins of the lung lobe and originated in the core area of the lobular or subpleural regions in the early stage ggo was the main manifestation and interstitial thickening of the interlobular gradually appeared showing reticular shadow changes in the ground glass shadow however the interlobular septal was rarely thickened and thickening and traction bronchiectasis occurred during the disease progression or repair period these ct findings are in line with the two studies 10 11 on the other hand shi reported obvious cystic changes which were not shown in our study 12 the differences could be related to the individual differences and the severity of the illness notably we did not find gravity distribution tree-bud pattern cavernous or cystic airspaces in the ct images the central interstitium is rarely affected except in serious patients in addition covid-19 patients were not found to have combined infections with bacteria and fungi in our studies and other studies 13 these features could be considered key identification points from other viral pneumoniact was indeed helpful to improve the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 at an early stage patients 9 19 and 25 were asymptomatic but ct showed intrapulmonary lesions small thin and patchy ggo could be seen on the chest ct in patient 21 fig 5 and the pcr results were negative twice later the third pcr result was positive and the lung had significant lesions with progression a woman who is the wife of the patient 3 and mother of patient 22 had two negative pcr results but the lesions in her lung had the same progression and the blood test also confirmed the sars-cov-2 infectionpcr of nasopharyngeal aspirate was regarded as a more sensitive method than conventional methods and was able to detect microorganisms that are difficult to culture and new microorganisms 14 15 however pcr as a diagnostic standard has the following problems the shortage of pcr reagents and detectability delayed the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 sometimes different brands of reagents would have different results pcr tests should be collected and detected by experienced clinical technicians and detected by approved clinical laboratories which limits its usage and is difficult to implement in basic hospitals when the virus load was low in the early infection it was hard to detect and the potential for false negative results needs to be considered and carefully controlled in pcr experiments 16 most importantly pcr cannot reflect the severity and progression of pneumonia while ct imaging could support this vacancy pcr tests showed false negative results in our study which is consistent with previous studies 10 11 in addition since pcr results required a 1- to 3-day delay and then identified patients as confirmed cases chest ct manifestations could appear earlier than viral nucleic acid assay in some cases it is reasonable that ct could reflect the progression of the diseases and was of great importance in the early diagnosis and isolation of suspected patientsthe main weakness of our study was that we had only 25 patients and our tracking time was very short none of the patients were death cases which limits our study however we focused on the first 25 patients in the luoyang area and the early stage of the emerging sars-cov-2 infection which had given information as a good reference for a quick response for other cities importing covid-19 casesin summary we suggested ct and epidemiological history as the primary clues and clinical symptoms and routine laboratory tests as the secondary clues for the early clinical diagnosis of suspicious patients to implement isolation and then wait for the nucleic acid results for respiratory infectious diseases regardless of viral pneumonia it has high infectivity and early isolation diagnosis and treatment could effectively reduce the transmission rate and mortality of covid-19 and control the global development of the epidemicthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is responsible for an ongoing pandemic that has already killed over 320000 people and paralyzed the global economy 1 currently the main method for laboratory diagnosis of sars-cov-2 is pcr testing of nasopharyngeal swabs there is an urgent need for highly specific and sensitive antibody detection assays to answer fundamental questions about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 and to implement and evaluate population-level control programs 2 efforts to understand the pathogenesis and define risk factors for severe sars-cov-2 disease have been hampered by our inability to identify all infected individuals irrespective of clinical symptoms to contain the pandemic many countries resorted to the widespread quarantine of cities and regions by deploying reliable antibody assays for population-level testing it will be possible to obtain the high-resolution spatial data needed to implement policies for containing the epidemic and informing strategies for re-opening communities and citiesstudies with sars-cov-2 and other human covs demonstrate that people rarely develop specific antibodies within the first 7 days after onset of symptoms 37 by 10-11 days after onset of symptoms greater than 90 of sars-cov-2 patients develop specific igg and igm 36 for sars-cov-1 and the more distantly related mers-cov igg antibodies have been observed to persist for at least one year after infection 8 9 these observations strongly support the feasibility of using antibody assays for identifying recent and remote sars-cov-2 infections and for conducting population-level surveillancesars-cov-2 is a -coronavirus a subgroup that includes the closely related sars-cov-1 and the more distantly related mers-cov and the common-cold human covs hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 10 many companies have quickly developed tests for sars-cov-2 antibody detection these assays utilize the inactivated whole virion viral nucleocapsid protein or viral spike protein as antigens in elisa lateral flow or other testing platforms while the performance of these assays has not been fully evaluated some assays appear quite sensitive when used 10 days or more after the onset of symptoms 6 11 the specificity of sars-cov-2 antibody assays has not been adequately addressed humans are frequently infected with hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 and most adults have antibodies to these viruses 10 any antibody cross-reactivity between common hcovs and sars-cov-2 would result in false-positive results interfering with antibody-based testing and surveillance for sars-cov-2sars-cov-1 and hcov oc43 elicit antibodies that cross-react against related covs 12 13 following the sars-cov-1 outbreak in 2003 the overall specificity of serological assays utilizing the nucleocapsid protein of sars-cov-1 was poor whereas assays based on the spike protein were more specific 1416 in recent studies the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 has shown promise as an antigen for specific antibody detection 4 17 18 here we report the production of properly folded recombinant receptor binding domains rbds from the spike proteins of sars and common-cold hcovs in mammalian cells we use these recombinant antigens and a large diverse panel of human and animal sera to evaluate the rbd as an antigen for sars-cov-2 serology we demonstrate that the recombinant sars-cov-2 rbd antigen is highly sensitive and specific for detection of antibodies induced by sars-covs we also observed a strong correlation between the levels of rbd-binding antibodies and levels of sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients our results support the use of rbd-based antibody assays for serology and as a correlate of neutralizing antibody levels in symptomatic people who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infectionsthe s1 and s2 subunits of the spike s protein of coronaviruses are required for viral entry the surface accessible receptor binding domain rbd on the s1 subunit binds to receptors on target cells whereas the exposure of the fusion loop in the s2 subunit induces fusion of the viral envelope to the host cellular membranes 19 the rbds of sars-covs which bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the host cells are also a major target of human antibodies fig 1a and b as the rbd is a common target of human antibodies and poorly conserved between sars-covs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses fig 1c this domain is a promising candidate for use in antibody-based diagnostic assays we expressed the rbd of 2003 and 2019 sars-co-vs and four common human coronaviruses hcov-hku-1 -oc43 -nl63 and -229e as fusion proteins that were secreted from human cells the recombinant rbds were purified from the cell culture medium by affinity chromatography and purity was confirmed by sds-page fig 1d we used sera and monoclonal antibodies from animals immunized with sars-cov-1 or -2 spike proteins to assess the structural integrity of the purified recombinant rbd antigens pooled serum from mice immunized with sars-cov-2 spike protein had antibodies that bound well to the rbd of sars-cov-2 and poorly to the rbds of sars-cov-1 and other common hcovs fig 1e sera from mice or rabbits immunized with sars-cov-1 or cross-reactive monoclonal antibody 240c reacted with the rbds of sars cov-1 and -2 but not common human covs fig 1e human serum collected before sars-cov-2 emerged contained antibodies to common - and -hcovs nl63 and hku-1 but not to sars-cov rbd antigens fig 1e these results suggest that the purified recombinant rbd antigens retain native structures required for specific antibody bindingto evaluate the specificity of the recombinant sars-cov-2 rbd in serology we used human sera collected from different populations before the current pandemic the sera were tested at a high concentration 120 dilution for binding to the recombinant rbds from sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 and common - and -hcovs fig 2 sera collected from healthy american adults n  20 before the sars-cov-2 pandemic frequently had high levels of antibodies to the recombinant rbds of nl63 and hku-1 covs but not to sars-covs fig 2a we also tested archived pre-sars-cov-2 pandemic sera collected from individuals in south asia the caribbean and central america who had recently recovered from arbovirus infections as in the case of healthy adults from the usa most of the subjects from different parts of the world had high levels of antibodies to the rbd of common hcovs but no antibodies to the rbd of sars-covs fig 2b to assess if other human respiratory viruses stimulated antibodies that cross-reacted with the recombinant sars-cov rbd we tested early convalescent sera from people with laboratory confirmed influenza a and respiratory syncytial virus infections and sera from guinea pigs immunized with a panel of different human respiratory viruses fig 2 c and d except guinea pigs immunized with sars-cov-1 none of the sera had detectable levels of antibodies to the recombinant rbd of sars-covsthe known pathogenic human covs are members of the -coronavirus and -coronavirus genera fig 3a hcov-nl63 and 229e are two -coronaviruses that frequently infect and cause a mild common-cold-like illness in most people hcov-oc43 and hku-1 are two group 2a -coronaviruses that also commonly infect people and cause mild disease most adults 90 have antibodies to these common-cold hcovs sars-cov-1 and -2 and mers-cov are group 2b and 2c zoonotic -coronaviruses that have recently crossed into humans and caused severe illness the - and -coronavirus genera also contain a large number of zoonotic viruses that infect different animal hosts which have not been implicated in human disease to date to further assess the specificity of sars-cov-2 rbd for serology we obtained and tested sera from people who had recently recovered from a laboratory-confirmed common-cold hcov infection and sera from guinea pigs immunized with different animal covs fig 3 b and c none of the immune sera from people exposed to recent hcov infections cross-reacted with the recombinant rbd of sars-covs none of the guinea pigs vaccinated with different zoonotic covs had antibodies that cross-reacted with the recombinant sars-cov rbds fig 3b and c these results establish that most individuals including people who have been recently exposed to acute common hcov infections do not have detectable levels of cross-reactive antibodies to the recombinant rbd of sars-covsto evaluate the sensitivity of the rbd of sars-cov-2 for identifying infected individuals we obtained a total of 77 serum samples from 63 patients with laboratory-confirmed ie pcr positive sars-cov-2 infections collected at different times after the onset of symptoms all the samples were tested for binding of total immunoglobulin ig and igm antibodies to recombinant rbd antigens from sars-covs and common-cold hcovs the sensitivity of the assay was high 98 and 81 respectively for ig and igm for specimens collected 9 days or more after onset of symptoms fig 4a as expected overall sensitivity was lower 57 and 43 respectively for ig and igm for specimens collected between 7 and 8 days after onset of symptoms fig 4a with samples collected 9 days or more after onset of symptoms we observed some ig and igm antibody cross reactivity with the rbd of sars-cov-1 67 and 30 respectively for ig and igm which was anticipated as these viruses are closely related group 2b -coronaviruses 20 21 when the specimens were further analyzed to estimate the timing of seroconversion we observed a marked transition from seronegative to seropositive for both ig and igm about 9 days after the onset of symptoms fig 4a and b by day 9 after onset of symptoms most patients had high end-point titers in the rbd ig elisa fig s1 to analyze the kinetics of all three of the major isotypes of serum antibodies within the first 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms we separately measured igg iga and igm in 49 serum samples obtained from sars-cov-2 infected patients at 9 days after onset of symptoms most individuals 4649 developed igg responses fig 4c iga and igm responses were observed less frequently iga  3849 igm 3449 than igg fig 4c for 14 individuals with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection we had two specimens collected at different times early in the infection fig 4d two subjects p70 and p50 were seronegative within the first 4 days and seropositive for both ig and igm 9 or more days after onset fig 4d for three subjects p58 p56 p52 the acute samples were collected after 9 days and the convalescent samples were collected 21 days or more after onset in these individuals both acute and convalescent samples were positive and we observed an increase in ig and igm levels in the second specimen for the remaining 9 subjects the acute specimen was collected on day 7 after onset and the convalescent specimen was collected 9 days after onset six out of the 9 subjects already had specific ig igm or both in the acute specimen collected on day 7 all the subjects except one p54 seroconverted or had elevated levels of antibody in the convalescent sample collected 9 days after onset of symptoms these results indicate that most people seroconvert between days 7 and 9 after onset of symptoms subject p54 was an outlier and did not develop specific ig or igm antibodies all the individuals with documented sars-cov-2 had ig but not igm antibodies that bound to the rbd of common hcovs which is consistent with their high prevalence in humans fig 4a these results demonstrate that the rbd of sars-cov-2 is a highly sensitive antigen for antibody detection in patients 9 days or more after onset of symptomsthe administration of convalescent plasma containing antibodies to sars-cov-2 is being evaluated for patients with severe disease while the fda has not approved convalescent plasma therapy on may 1 2020 the fda recommended that sars-cov-2 neutralizing titers of at least 1160 should be used for human passive immunization studies further the fda also recommended that a titer of 180 may be acceptable if an alternative matched unit is not available as the rbd domain of s protein is critical for viral entry antibodies targeting this domain of sars-cov-2 are likely to be neutralizing and potentially protective as is seen in cell culture and animal models for other pathogenic covs 19 22 to assess the relationship between the rbd-binding activity and the neutralizing antibody response we tested 50 pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 patient immune sera in a sars-cov-2 luciferase neutralization assay fig 5 as judged by the spearman test   086 p  00001 we observed that the magnitude of the total rbd-binding ig antibody strongly correlated with the levels of neutralizing antibodies in sars-cov-2 patients fig 5a moreover the patient samples with high levels of igm antibodies were strongly associated with the highest neutralizing antibody titers in early convalescence spearman   083 p  00001 fig 5b 6 weeks after onset of symptoms the neutralizing antibody kinetics in patients mirrored the kinetics of rbd antibody development fig 5c and fig s2 none of the patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection 08 had any detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies within the first eight days after the onset of symptoms while low levels of neutralizing antibody titers were detectable in 91 of patients 2022 21 days after the onset of symptoms only 73 of patients 1622 had a neutralization titer of at least 180currently patients who have had a documented sars-cov-2 infection identified by rt-pcr or a serologic test and who are clear of symptoms for at least 14 days are recruited for convalescent plasma donation we evaluated the neutralizing potency in patient samples collected between 1 and 40 days with a titer of at least 1160 fig 5d we observed that 32 of patients 722 developed weak to no neutralizing antibodies even 21 days after onset of symptoms suggesting that days after the start of symptoms is a poor determinant of the levels of sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies in the patients included in our study particularly within the early convalescent phase 6 weeks to evaluate whether a simple rbd elisa can be used as a surrogate for neutralizing potency in sars-cov-2 patients we analyzed the relationship between the level of total ig antibody to rbd and a neutralizing antibody titer of at least 1160 we observed that 2224 people who had a substantial total ig binding antibody to rbd 15 od also developed a robust neutralizing antibody titer fig 5e notably only 326 people who developed a relatively weak rbd-binding antibody had a neutralizing antibody titer higher than 1160 one subject p54 neither seroconverted for rbd antigen nor developed neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov-2 fig 4d and e and fig s2serology is critical to understanding the transmission pathogenesis mortality rate and epidemiology of emerging viruses in the few months after the discovery of sars-cov-2 as a human pathogen scientists have developed a large number of antibody assays and many commercial tests are now available although none of the assays have been fully validated yet the fda has granted emergency use authorization eua for multiple tests while stressing the need for further validation investigators have already encountered problems with the specificity and sensitivity of commercial assays rushed to market 4 22 widespread use of inaccurate antibody assays could lead to policies that exacerbate the current sars-cov-2 pandemic instead of containing itto address the need for reliable antibody-based diagnostic assays we focused on the rbd domain of the spike protein because this region is poorly conserved between different covs and is also known to be a major target of human antibodies 19 a major concern with using a protein domain instead of a full-length protein or whole virion for antibody detection is possible reduction in assay sensitivity however we observed that over 95 of sars-cov-2 patients developed antibodies to the rbd 9 days after onset of symptoms although our study included only a few recent convalescent sera and relatively large numbers of presumably positive samples from past common human cov infections the high specificity of the rbd antigen was also evident with the serum specimens from animals that were hyperimmunized with other zoonotic covs some patients infected with sars-cov-2 had antibodies that cross-reacted with the rbd of sars-cov-1 we have not tested the more distantly related rbd ag from mers cov or the serum samples from individuals with confirmed mers infection since sars-cov-1 and mers cov seroprevalence are very low in humans the sars-cov-2 antibody cross-reactivity with sars-cov-1 is unlikely to pose diagnostic challenges other recent studies that have been published or under peer review also support the high specificity and sensitivity of the sars-cov-2 rbd for antibody detection 4 17 18 amanat and colleagues tested samples from sars-cov-2 patients collected at the beginning of the epidemic in the usa and reported that the full length s protein and the rbd performed well for specific antibody detection 17 okba and colleagues compared the performance of different sars-cov-2 antigens for antibody detection using samples from 10 sars-cov-2 patients in europe 4 for the sars-cov-2 spike rbd they observed levels of specificity and sensitivity that were comparable to our results reported here the s2 subunit which comprises conserved regions between covs was less specific than the rbd 4 perera and colleagues evaluated the performance of the rbd for antibody detection using samples from 24 sars-cov-2 patients in hong kong 18 they also observed high specificity and sensitivity when patients were tested 10 days or more after onset of illness our study with 77 specimens from 63 documented sars-cov-2 patients which includes patients presenting to hospitals in north carolina and georgia with varying levels of severity together with these recent studies conducted in new york europe and hong kong strongly support the use of sars-cov-2 rbd as an antigen for antibody detectionwe designed the assay for separate detection of rbd-specific total ig and igm as the pandemic is ongoing and most infections are likely to have occurred within the past few months infected individuals have variable levels of antigen-specific igg igm and iga fig 4c to maximize assay sensitivity and to prevent different antibody isotypes competing for binding sites and reducing assay signal we measured total ig we did not observe any decrease in assay specificity by designing the assay to monitor levels of total ig instead of igg binding to the rbd even at high serum concentration or with hyperimmune sera our study showed that igm and iga antibodies can also be detected using rbd-based serological assays both iga and igm antibodies are relatively short lived and indicative of a recent exposure when conducting large scale population level surveillance for sars-cov-2 antibodies it will be possible to distinguish recent from remote infections by measuring both total ig and igm or iga binding to the rbdantibody assays that correlate with protective immune responses in individuals who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection and also reflect herd immunity at a population level are urgently needed to define each individuals risk of disease and to identify communities at high risk for new waves of infection in animal studies with sars-cov-1 virus-neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated with protective immune responses 19 we observed a striking correlation between the levels of rbd antibodies in patients and the ability of patient sera to neutralize sars-cov-2 virus other groups have recently reported finding a strong correlation between spikerbd antibodies and sars-cov-2 neutralization in patients infected with sars-cov-2 4 17 18 our results point out that roughly one-third of patients develop very low or no neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov-2 and that ig and igm antibodies are useful predictors of neutralizing antibody levels in patients in the early convalescent phase 6 weeks as people developing a high level of rbd-binding antibodies 15 od also have a robust neutralizing response a simple rbd-based elisa can be a useful tool to identify blood plasma donors while further studies are needed to fully evaluate rbd antibodies as correlate of protective immunity the results to date indicate that rbd antibodies are a promising correlate of protection in the early convalescent phase a simple antibody detection assay that also predicts individual-level risk of disease will be a major advance for vaccine development and immunogenicity of vaccines because sars-cov-2 neutralization assays are time-consuming and require bsl-3 containmentone sars-cov-2 patient p54 who tested positive for viral rna and required hospitalization did not develop rbd-specific ig igm or neutralizing antibodies even at 16 days after the onset of symptoms this was the only person among the 68 pcr positive subjects who did not seroconvert by 9 days after onset of symptoms in the rbd-based assay while we cannot rule out the possibility of a false positive pcr test result others have also reported rare instances where people infected with sars-covs have atypical dampened immune responses 23 further studies are needed to establish the frequency and significance of atypical antibody responses in sars-cov-2 patients and characterize the serological repertoire and epitopes targeted by the antibodies in convalescent seraas sars-cov-2 infections in the southeastern us have started to increase relatively recently all convalescent samples used in this study were collected within 90 days following onset of symptoms in most patients the convalescent sera had high end-point titers 11000 in the rbd ig elisa supporting the utility of this assay even as antibody levels start to wane over time we need to prioritize studies to prospectively monitor sars-cov-2 patients to determine the long-term kinetics of antibody levels and the performance of antibody detection assays over timeall the sars-cov-2 human immune sera used for this study were collected from symptomatic patients that included many with serious illness requiring hospitalization the research community currently does not know if individuals experiencing mildinapparent symptoms after sars-cov-2 infection have similar kinetics and levels of rbd-binding antibodies as those experiencing symptomatic infections studies must be done with individuals experiencing mildinapparent sars-cov-2 infections to define the kinetics and levels of rbd antibodies before implementing large population-level antibody testingthe goal of the study was to evaluate the performance of rbd-based spike antigen for reliable detection of sars-cov-2-specific antibodies we produced properly folded rbd from the spike proteins of sars and common-cold hcovs in mammalian cells and used this antigen to evaluate a large panel of human sera from documented sars-cov-2 patients and control subjects and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic covs we also used a sars-cov-2 luciferase neutralization assay to assess the dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response and its association with the rbd-binding activitythe structure coordinate sets of the spike proteins spike protein complexes with their cognate receptor ace2 and monoclonal antibodies were obtained from the protein data bank pdb the structures were aligned to the reference spike protein using the pymol molecular graphics system version 12r3pre schrdinger llc molecular

analyses were performed using spss software ver 260 ibm armonk ny usain december 2019 the local centers for disease control and prevention cdc in wuhan city hubei province china reported a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases the infections named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who were considered to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 from bats 13 since the outbreak the virus has rapidly spread from wuhan to chinas other areas as of february 20 2020 the cumulative number of confirmed cases had reached 66577 in china with 2239 deaths mortality rate of 30 including 62442 confirmed cases and 2144 deaths in hubei province early observation of infections of health-care workers as well as family members has suggested that human-to-human transmission has occurred through close contacts 4 5 the epidemic doubled in size every 6474 days in its early stage and would lag in imported cities by 12 weeks with the basic reproductive number r0 estimated to be 22268 4 6 7the outbreak of covid-19 coincided with the eve of the traditional chinese spring festival many residents visited their relatives and friends leading to sharply increased transportation and potential risk of rapid transmission between cities 8 although chinese authorities imposed travel bans on wuhan and several cities near wuhan since january 23 2020 9 it was estimated that 5 million of residents had left wuhan before the lockdown which might contribute to the spread of virus to other domestic cities after the outbreak chinese authorities have taken unprecedented measures to control the source of infection including screening of high risk populations prompt identification and reporting of suspicious cases and rapid diagnosis of cases 10 the chinese government required residents to self-quarantine or stay home from work and avoid big crowds by february 20 the number of daily new confirmed cases nationwide had dropped significantly across the country in particular no new cases for three consecutive days were achieved in some provinces or cities however the local epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 in the imported cities remain unclear on the other hand according to the national data 185 of covid-19 cases in china presented severe symptoms of infections 11 the associations between the severity of disease and epidemiologic factors need investigationtianjin is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of central government of china it is located in the northern part of the north china plain 1171 kilometers from wuhan tianjin is one of the representative cities in china as it has a population of 156 million residents developed economy and convenient transportation in this study we provided an analysis of spatial and temporal distribution of all 131 confirmed cases in tianjin before february 20 to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of covid-19 in addition we reconstructed the transmission chain and explored the effects of epidemiologic factors on the severity of the disease in this studysoon after sars-cov-2 was identified as the etiological pathogen of the pneumonia outbreak the disease was classified as class b infectious disease and managed as class a 12 13 confirmed patients are required to be reported within 24 h to the national notifiable infectious disease surveillance system according to the standard protocol issued by national health commission of the peoples republic of china nhcc the information of each covid-19 case was input into the data system by local hospitals and cdc personnel who investigated and collected possible exposure and exposure route each case had a fixed number in the data system in accordance with the order of diagnosis all case records contained unique personal id number so cases were not duplicated in the systemwe collected the covid-19 epidemic data released from the official website of tianjin municipal government httpwwwtjgovcn and the tianjin health committee the relevant data were collected for analysis after removing all personally identifiable informationcase data included basic demographic information date of symptom onset date of isolation date of medical treatment date of diagnosis exposure routes clinical symptoms and the severity of disease wuhan-related exposure referred to a history that patients recently lived or traveled in wuhan or had close contact with a person who had been to wuhanpatients were diagnosed based on clinical symptoms andor a history of exposure and positive results from viral nucleic acid tests according to the diagnosis and treatment program of 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia issued by the national health commission of china 14 15 patients were divided into two groups based on the severity of the disease namely non-severe and severe infection groups non-severe infected patients defined as those without pneumonia or mild pneumonia severe cases defined as those presented dyspnea respiratory rate 30min blood oxygen saturation  93 pao2fio2 ratio 300 and pulmonary infiltration  50 within 2448 h or those cases with respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunctionfailurethe date of onset was defined as the date on which a case began to develop symptoms such as fever or cough according to self-report data in the epidemiological investigation date of isolation defined as the date of self-isolation compulsory isolation or hospitalizationfor spatio-temporal analysis the number of confirmed cases was plotted according to the date of symptom onset and date of diagnosis respectively the cumulative numbers of cases before specific time points january 21 2020 january 31 2020 february 10 2020 and february 20 2020 were mapped by using esri arcmap 1041 software according to the geographic location respectivelystatistical analysis was performed using spss 250 quantitative variables were expressed as means  standard deviation sd or medians and percentiles 25th percentile 75th percentile categorical variables were reported as numbers and percentages the proportions were compared using the chi-squared test comparisons of continuous variables between the groups were performed using independent t-test for normally distributed data and the mann-whitney u-test for data not normally distributed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors that were associated with severe infection with results reported as the odds ratio or at 95 confidence interval ci p  005 was considered statistically significanta total of 131 covid-19 cases were diagnosed in tianjin before february 20 2020 the first infected patient developed symptom of fever on january 14 2020 and was subsequently diagnosed on january 21 epidemic curves of confirmed cases were drawn based on the date of onset and the date of diagnosis figure 1a also the numbers of confirmed cases were shown according to the duration of symptom onset to treatment isolation and diagnosis figure 1b geographically three districts hedong xiqing and nankai reported confirmed cases at the earliest on january 21 figure 2a by february 20 a total of 1416 districts reported covid-19 cases with baodi district reporting the most confirmed cases n  56 figure 2bwe analyzed the transmission chain of covid-19 cases in tianjin figure 3 there were two major clusters of infections in one cluster two train conductors traveled to wuhan and developed fever after returning to tianjin one of them infected eight of his colleagues among whom four transmitted the virus to their respective family members a total of 17 people were infected in the event the second cluster was from a shopping mall located in baodi district a 35-years-old saleswoman with an unclear source of infection developed fever on january 21 through cross infection she transmitted the infection to one of her family members five salespersons and 22 customers among them two salespersons and 10 customers transmitted the virus to their respective family members the cluster included a total of 45 casesthe analysis of the transmission chain showed that many index cases had a wuhan-related exposure red figures in figure 3 transmission from a family member constituted 42 usually at the end of transmission chainof 131 confirmed cases male 542 the mean age was 487  171 years old table 1 a total of 22 168 cases had a wuhan-related exposure fever was the commonest symptom 824 the median duration of symptom onset to treatment was 10 0040 days the duration of symptom onset to isolation 20 0060 days and the duration of symptom onset to diagnosis 50 2080 daysthe patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of the disease non-severe infection n  93 and severe infection n  22 which was not included 16 cases whose disease conditions were unclear table 2 compared with patients with non-severe infections patients with severe infections were more likely to be male 462 vs 773 p  0009 and had a wuhan-related exposure 140 vs 409 p  0004 there was no statistical difference in clinical symptoms including fever cough fatigue and headache between the two groups p  005we performed a univariate logistic regression analysis and found that male or 3953 95 ci 1346 11610 p  0012 and wuhan-related exposure or 4260 95 ci 1517 11962 p  0006 were risk factors for severe infection table 3 multivariate logistic regression showed that only male or 3913 95 ci 1206 12696 p  0023 was an independent risk factor for severe infectionin this study we retrospectively analyzed 131 confirmed covid-19 cases in tianjin and the results showed that sars-cov-2 infection occurred in 1416 districts with the most cases in baodi district transmission from a family member constituted 42 usually at the end of transmission chain although sars-cov-2 was highly contagious most patients had mild manifestations male was a risk factor for severe infectionfirst we displayed the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases of covid-19 in tianjin tianjin lies between 11643 to 11804 e and 3834 to 4015 n the city has 16 districts with a total area of 11966 km2 and a population of 156 million the epidemic curve showed that 512 65127 of patients were treated or seek medical treatment on the day or next day of symptom onset 01 day a small number of patients 94 12127 who had close contact with an infected individual were isolated before symptoms appeared the period from symptom onset to diagnosis was 50 2080 daysanother contribution of this study is to describe the transmission chain and spreading pattern of sars-cov-2 in tianjin since january 23 chinese government required individuals with wuhan-related exposure history to report personal information and quarantine themselves regardless of infection in this study a total of 22 168 cases had a wuhan-related exposure except for the initial cases most of these patients implemented self-quarantine after the outbreak thus they did not infect other people suggesting the importance of self-quarantine especially for those with high-risk exposures in addition chinese authorities required residents to stay at home avoiding outdoor activities as a result a considerable proportion of transmissions occurred between families or relatives however this broke the chain of infection transmission and therefore prevented the spread of covid-19 on the contrary outside activities such as transmission in the shopping mall at baodi district led to complex cross transmission and a wider range of transmission this is consistent with the findings from kim et al who found that transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus was determined by the number of contacts 16 therefore it is crucial to isolate patients and trace and quarantine contacts as early as possible the data from transmission chain analysis will help to make decision for some regions that have not yet begun or are experiencing a covid-19 epidemicthe sars-cov-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets after infection patients may show bilateral ground-glass opacity or consolidation on chest ct scans along with common symptoms that include fever dry cough and shortness of breath at the onset of illness 1719 in severe cases dyspnea respiratory distress syndrome or septic shock may develop 18 in this study 191 of cases presented severe manifestations we analyzed the risk factors for early severe infections in tianjin in a recently published study with a sample size of 72314 the mortality rate for men was significantly higher than that for women 638 vs 362 11 our study found that male was an independent risk factor for severe infection suggesting the necessity of paying more attention to early intervention we speculated on the causes of the association between male and severe covid-19 infection males and females differ in their immunological responses to pathogens and males generally show higher susceptibility prevalence and severity of infection than females including respiratory tract infection 2022 observed in mice infected with mycoplasma pulmonis the pulmonary parenchyma disease of male mice is always more serious than that of female mice 23 on the other hand smoking is generally more prevalent among men than women although no firm conclusions can be drawn about the association between smoking and severity of covid-19 24 some evidence shows that active cigarette smoking and up-regulation of ace-2 expression an entry receptor of sars-cov-2 in lower airways may in part contribute to the increased risk of severe covid-19 25 further investigation is needed to confirm the association between male and severe covid-19 infection and investigate the accurate mechanisms the severe infection group had a higher proportion of patients with wuhan-related exposure which however was not an independent risk factor in fact most of these patients were infected in the early stage of the epidemic when the disease might be easily ignored or diagnosed delayed based on a previous study patients treated in the intensive care unit icu n  36 compared with patients not treated in the icu n  102 were older median age 66 vs 51 years 26 also another study showed that older age were associated with severe infection 27 in our study the mean age of patients with severe infections was higher than that of patients with non-severe infections but the difference was not statistically significant p  0145 further studies with larger sample size are needed for determining whether age is a risk factor for severe infectionthis study provided detailed data regarding the covid-19 epidemic of tianjin a representative city in china however this study has some limitations first although we collected all confirmed cases before february 20 2020 in tianjin for analysis the sample size was still small secondly all cases in this study were clinically diagnosed and a fairly high percentage of cases were investigated by professional epidemiologists however some data were not be collected or missed in the system such as underlying diseases or comorbidities thirdly memory bias might exist in the epidemiological investigation for instance date of symptom onset which could lead to inaccurate estimates of some variables in addition the proportion of patients with cough in this study 214 was lower than the two earlier reports 677 and 594 26 28 it might be caused by a self-reported data of patients on early symptomsin conclusion this study provides important information on the epidemic of covid-19 by analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases in tianjin we suggest that self-quarantine at an outbreaks early stage especially for those with high-risk exposures is conducive to prevent the transmission of infection further investigation is needed to confirm the risk factors for severe covid-19 infection and investigate the mechanisms involvedthe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors

person to person transmission occurs through droplets eg coughing sneezing talking within 6 feet and the virus may survive up to nine days on surfaces4 making individuals in communal living environments including personal care homes and nursing homes more susceptible to transmission of the virus the combination of a communal living environment and being elderly presents a significant public health problemindividuals infected with covid-19 develop symptoms within two days to two weeks after being exposed to the virus through human transmission5 in an early large chinese study of over 44000 patients researchers found that most patients with covid-19 have mild or no symptoms 14 of patients have severe symptoms including dyspnea and hypoxia and 5 have more severe symptoms including respiratory failure6 the most common symptoms reported by infected individuals were fever 98 cough 76 and myalgia or fatigue 447 less common symptoms included sputum production 28 headache 8 and diarrhea 3 studies from the us have found that 19 of patients testing positive for covid-19 were hospitalized and 6 were admitted to an intensive care unit3 the most recent cdc estimates of the mortality rate in the united states show that the rate is similar to china ranging from 09 overall with an increased mortality rate in patients with comorbid medical conditions including cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease hypertension and cancer8
in this report we present four patients diagnosed with covid-19 who initially presented with altered mental status without fever or cough or respiratory distress all patients had significant comorbid medical problems and dementia and were living in a communal setting ie a personal care home in a large metropolitan area which may have presented a greater risk of infectionthis report includes four patients living independently in the non-memory care section of a personal care home all four patients had established diagnoses of dementia two with alzheimers disease the diagnoses were made by a geriatric psychiatrist cfw based on a neuropsychiatric evaluation and clinical information obtained from family members and caregivers each of the four patients developed ams without fever or respiratory symptoms and were transferred to the local emergency department and were tested for the covid-19 virus as part of their medical work up all four patients tested positive for the covid-19 virus and met the inclusion criteria for this report ams without fever or respiratory symptoms and positive covid-19 test after the patients tested positive for the covid-19 virus clinical information was obtained from their medical records families and caregivers to determine their clinical symptoms prior to the diagnosis of covid-19four elderly patients mean age  833  102 years three females initially presented with altered mental status ams which included 1 confusion agitation and refusing care 2 confusion including laying in bed in diarrhea 3 two patients with increasing confusion disorientation and loss of appetite  all four patients had common risk factors for developing a covid-19 infection communal living older age and multiple comorbid medical problems none of the patients had the classic presentation of fever andor respiratory symptoms  all four patients were sent to the emergency department ed within 24-48 hours of developing ams in the ed all the patients were tested for covid-19 using the molecular diagnosispolymerase chain reaction pcr-based testing the test was positive for all four patients within 3-7 days chest x-rays were positive for pneumonia in all four patients  all of the patients were hospitalized two patients were admitted to hospice and are currently in grave condition the other two are currently in rehabilitation therapy but still dependent on oxygen a summary of the patients time to diagnosis and comorbid medical conditions is outlined in table 1
altered mental status may be one of the first signs of covid-19 infection in individuals with dementia in the majority of adult patients respiratory distress is the most common presenting symptom waiting for patients to develop dyspnea andor fever will delay treatment recognizing the covid-19 infection early is especially important in the frail elderly particularly for individuals in communal living facilities where isolating these patients can help limit the spread of the virusthere is evidence from previous viral epidemics of associated neuropsychiatric symptoms these symptoms ranged from encephalitis lethargic during the spanish flu pandemic 1918- 1920 to the more recent coronavirus epidemics sars-cov-1 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 20129 during the sars and mers epidemics neuropsychiatric symptoms included encephalopathy seizures guillain-barre syndrome and neuromuscular disorders9
chen et al noted that disorders of consciousness eg hypoxic encephalopathy were more frequent in patients who succumbed to the covid-19 than patients who went on to survive the infection 20 vs 1 respectively10 and similar to the patients described in this brief report a new york times article citing physicians caring for covid-19 patients also described patients presenting with confusion and ams prior to developing a fever or respiratory illness11 the article also references findings from physicians in wuhan china who collected data on neurological findings in 214 patients hospitalized for sars-cov-2 infection12 these physicians found that 364 of patients had neurological findings ranging from impaired consciousness and skeletal muscle injury as assessed by myalgia and an elevated creatinine phosphokinase to cerebrovascular disease eg ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhageli et al cite evidence that the coronaviruses may be neuroinvasive exhibited by neurological signs including headache nausea and vomiting and that the symptoms are not always confined to the respiratory system13 they argue that the coronavirus induced respiratory failure can be due to spread of the coronavirus through a synapse-connected route from the lungs to the medullary cardiorespiratory center a case published online march 31 2020 in radiology supports the potential neuroinvasive nature of the virus poyiadjii et al describe acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy in a female airline worker in her late fifties as the result of a covid-19 infection14 she had initially presented with a three-day history of cough fever and ams the first case of meningitis associated with sars-cov-2 was reported online april 7 202015 this patient originally presented with fever and fatigue and developed generalized seizures nine days laterother researchers have posited additional potential mechanisms for covid-related neuroinflammation including cytokine network dysregulation peripheral immune cell transmigration and a post infection aberrant autoimmune response9 two of the four patients in this report had alzheimers disease ad and neuroinflammation is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in the progression of ad16

the clinical profiles of demented patients infected with the covid-19 virus are just beginning to be examined the earliest signs of infection in some older adults with dementia may be ams even before the respiratory symptoms are apparent early detection is especially important in this patient population and recognizing ams as an initial symptom of covid-19 may help prevent the spread of the disease and guide treatmentall three authors made substantive intellectual contributions to this report drsward and figiel were involved in the conception of the paper acquisition of data and analysis and interpretation of the results they both approved the final version of the paper and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work dr mcdonald was involved with the conception and design and interpretation of data approved the final manuscript and agrees to be accountable for all aspects of the workdrs ward and figiel have no relevant conflicts of interestdr mcdonald has research contracts from stanley foundation soterix neuronetics neosync and cervel neurotherapeutics he is an ad hoc member of several nimh and ninds study sections he is a member of the american psychiatric association apa council on research and quality representing ect and neuromodulation therapies dr mcdonald is compensated as the chair of the dsmb for the nia multicenter study he receives royalties from oxford university press to co-edit a book on the clinical guide to transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of depression he is a paid consultant for signant health he has endowed chair funded by the jb fuqua foundation he is an employee of emory university school of medicinein december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origins occurred in wuhan hubei province china1 thanks to the high-throughput sequencing technology the pathogen that caused this series of pneumonia was soon identified2

similar to other coronavirus human-to-human transmission of covid-19 pneumonia has been confirmed in case reports1 the disease has rapidly spread from wuhan to other areas in china as well as other countries including japan korea italy usa and germany et al5 6 7 8 therefore the world health organization who has recently declared the covid-2019 a public health emergency of international concern9 as of feb 29 2020 a total of 85403 cases of confirmed covid-19 pneumonia have been reported worldwide10
the clinical characteristics of the covid-19 have been partially reported huang et al first described 41 cases of covid-19 in which most patients had a history of exposure to huanan seafood wholesale market11 subsequently chen et al and wang et al reported findings from 99 cases and 138 cases of covid-19 in wuhan respectively suggesting that elderly with comorbidities were prone to develop acute respiratory depress syndrome ards12

13 initial presentation of 13 confirmed patients outside wuhan has also been revealed14 most recently guan et al delineated the clinical characteristics of the largest case series of covid-19 in china which confirmed the epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission and that the disease severity predict poor clinical outcomes15 however the clinical course of the covid-19 is still not clear herein we collected data from 249 laboratory confirmed cases aiming to present the clinical progress of the covid-19for this retrospective single-center study we recruited patients from jan 20 to feb 6 2020 at shanghai public health clinical center sphcc shanghai china sphcc is the pointed hospital that treat covid-19 for adults in shanghai all patients with covid-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to chinese national guideline for covid-19 diagnosis and treatment as well as the world health organization interim guidance4 the study was approved by ethics committee of sphcc and informed consent was obtained from patients involved before data were collected retrospectively informed consent was waived for patients unable to obtain an informed consent ie those discharged or diedepidemiological demographic underlying comorbidities symptoms signs laboratory findings x-ray chest computed tomographic ct scans treatment and outcome data were obtained from patients medical records the final date of follow-up was feb 25 2020 in clinical practice body temperature was measured by means of digital thermometers the parents were asked to take their body temperatures at least four times a day or even more frequently when the fever was high defervescence was defined as patients maintained normal body temperature without any antipyretics eg nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs corticosteroidpcr of sars-cov-2 for the upper respiratory specimens was not tested every day after admission for patients with repeated pcr tests the first date of the result was recorded if the patients had consecutive negative results while the latest result and date were recorded for patients who had inconsistent results of the consecutive testslaboratory confirmation of the sars-cov-2 was achieved by the chinese center for disease prevention and control cdc subsequent test of upper respiratory tract samples for sars-cov-2 after admission was performed by both sphcc and cdc based on the recommendation by the national institute for viral disease control and prevention china httpivdcchinacdccnkyjz202001t20200121211337htmldepending on the distribution of the data categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages and continuous variables were described with mean median and interquartile range iqr values means for continuous variables were compared via independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed otherwise the mann-whitney test was used proportions for categorical variables were compared by the 2 test wilcoxon ranksum tests were used for nonnormally distributed data the median time to temperature normalization and viral clearance was examined by kaplanmeier estimates the association between baseline clinical characteristics laboratory results and intensive care unit icu admission was calculated with logistical regression all analyses were performed using stata v120 statacorp college station tx the figures were constructed using graphpad prism 80 graphpad software inc san diego caas of feb 6 2020 a total of 249 patients were enrolled in this study the median age was 51 years old iqr 3664 years and 126 506 were male the duration from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 427 days in patients with symptoms ninety patients 361 had one or more coexisting chronic medical conditions cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were the most common comorbidities 55217 followed by endocrine system diseases 25100 the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever 217871 cough 91365 and fatigue 39157 less common symptoms included dizziness and headache shortness of breath rhinorrhoea sore throat diarrhea and inappetence table 1

the host immune responses against the sars-cov-2 may also contribute substantially to covid-19 pathogenesis in the current study both older age and lower cd4 t cells count indicators of immunosuppression were significantly associated with icu admission for our patients who stayed in icu elevated interleukin 6 levels had been observed data not shown which is in consistent with the previous reports12

22 therefore the persistence of covid-19 induced excessive but aberrant non-effective response which is associated with cytokine storm11

23 a small proportion of patients developed ards early in the clinical course and five of the patients in icu did not improve significantly after viral control consistently inflammation persists after viral clearance in sars21 taken together these evidences indicate that disease progression may be a result of an over exuberant host response along this line apart from effective antiviral agents which could decrease viral load at the early stage and in turn result in decreased immunopathological damage the role of host-directed therapy could be an important tool to reduce the mortality24
theoretically corticosteroid treatment could have a role in the treatment of covid-19 as it suppress lung inflammation despite of fever persistence and radiological worsening in the first week most of the patients had normal temperature and improvement in images with or without supportive therapy from the second week after onset of symptoms most importantly corticosteroid had been shown to delay clearance of mers-cov from respiratory tract and sars-cov from blood respectively25

26 in the current study delayed covid-19 clearance was associated with icu admission therefore in agreement with the who guideline we are against the usage of corticosteroid for the treatment of covid-194

27
there are some limitations of our study first a small proportion the patients were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission therefore clinical outcomes in these patients were not available and continued observations are still needed second we did not test sars-cov-2 daily for everybody hence the actual duration to viral clearance should be shorter than the estimated one meanwhile we did not quantify the viral load of the sars-cov-2 and false negative of the pcr result for upper respiratory sample has also been reported15 for that reason studies on the dynamic changes of the viral load are still warrantedin summary the majority of covid-19 cases are mild the two phase pattern of the disease progression suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy at later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of cvoid-19the authors declare that they have no competing intereststhe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a pandemic infectious disease threatening the world in daegu korea the outbreak started on february 18 2020 and peaked on february 29 2020 with 741 new cases confirmed in a day1 in korea the method used for the diagnosis of all cases of covid-19 was real-time polymerase chain reactionwith an explosive increase in the number of new patients hospital bed shortage was a great challenge to the healthcare system1 we developed and employed a remote telephone severity scoring system daegu severity score for covid-19 for assigning priority for hospitalization and arranging for facility isolation therapeutic living centers starting on february 29 20201 fifteen centers were operated for the 3033 admissions to covid-19 therapeutic living centers1 approximately 150 physicians of the daegu medical association dma voluntarily participated in this study and checked the status of patients who were staying at home on a daily basis1 they reported the interview results to the team arranging hospitalization or facility isolation in daegu during the interviews several dma physicians found that a significant number of the patients stated experiencing acute loss of smell anosmia or loss of taste ageusia acute smell and taste disorders are related to a wide range of respiratory viral infections23covid-19 is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations4 in a typical case a high fever appears after dry cough in some cases viral pneumonia develops and progresses resulting in shortness of breath45 common symptoms among patients with covid-19 include fever dry cough shortness of breath dyspnea muscle ache myalgia confusion headache sore throat rhinorrhea chest pain diarrhea nauseavomiting conjunctival congestion nasal congestion sputum production fatigue malaise hemoptysis and chills46789 a literature review revealed a few published articles on the importance of anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of covid-1910111213from march 8 2020 dma physicians prospectively questioned patients newly diagnosed with covid-19 who were awaiting hospitalization or facility isolation regarding the presence of anosmia or ageusia they also provided counseling on a daily basis for these symptoms until admission to hospitals or therapeutic living centersthe data collected on anosmia or ageusia during the telephone severity scoring performed from march 8 2020 to march 31 2020 were analyzed retrospectively for the evaluation of the diagnostic significance of anosmia or ageusia in covid-19 additional telephone calls were made after admission to assess the duration of symptom persistence among those who reported that anosmia or ageusia persisted until hospitalization or facility isolationwe analyzed the collected data using descriptive statistics and kaplan-meier analysis for the evaluation of factors associated with the recovery from anosmia or ageusia statistical analyses were performed using r statistics version 35approximately 15 153 4883191 patients had anosmia or ageusia in the early stage of covid-19 fig 1 among patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity 2342 patients 367 157 had anosmia or ageusia the basic characteristics of the patients with or without anosmia or ageusia are summarized in table 1 anosmia or ageusia was significantly more common among females and younger individuals p  001 and p  0001 respectively table 1the duration of these two symptoms was ascertained based on the daily interviews conducted by dma physicians during the waiting period for hospitalization or facility isolation and by follow-up telephone interviews with 232 for anosmia and 196 for ageusia patientsrecovery from anosmia is expressed using a survival curve fig 2a kaplan-meier graphs with log-rank tests were generated using data on recovery from anomia based on demographic variables including age of  50 years and sex no significant differences were observed in log-rank teststhe median time to recovery from anosmia was 7 days and the recovery time pattern is depicted in fig 2b the median time to recovery from ageusia was 7 days and the recovery time pattern is shown in fig 2c most patients with anosmia or ageusia recovered within 3 weeks fig 2b and c young age particularly the age group of 2039 years showed a tendency to be associated with a longer persistence of anosmia fig 2d recovery from ageusia was similar to that from anomia supplementary fig 1 recently anosmia was reported in a small cross-sectional survey study of covid-1911 this article did not report follow-up information and included a relatively small number of patients 59 patients our data were derived from 3191 patients among whom 232 anosmia and 143 ageusia were followed up regarding the persistence of these symptomssmell and taste disorders are related to a wide range of viral infections23 infection of the upper respiratory tract can cause acute-onset anosmia or ageusia because of viral damage to the olfactory epithelium3 moreover viruses that can use the olfactory nerve as a route into the central nervous system include influenza a virus herpesviruses poliovirus rabies virus parainfluenza virus adenoviruses and japanese encephalitis virus2 in mouse models sars-cov demonstrated transneuronal penetration through the olfactory bulb and its infection resulted in the rapid transneuronal spread of the virus to connected areas of the brain14 in covid-19 headache may not only be a constitutional symptom but also be a symptom induced by invasion of the central nervous system human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for sars-cov-21012damage to the olfactory nerve during invasion and multiplication of sars-cov-2 may explain anosmia observed in the early stage of covid-19 therefore anosmia or ageusia may be more frequently observed in the covid-19 patients than other respiratory viral infectionsageusia may be a secondary result of olfactory dysfunction however the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor which is the main host cell receptor of sars-cov-2 for binding and penetrating cells is widely expressed on epithelial cells of the oral mucosa15 damage of mucosal epithelial cells of the oral cavity may explain ageusia observed in the early stage of covid-19 this evidence may explain the pathogenetic mechanism underlying anosmia and ageusia in covid-19high transmissibility of covid-19 before and immediately after symptom onset was reported with a recent epidemic study16 early diagnosis is important for the control of covid-19 recognition of early signs such as anosmia or ageusia might be very helpful for the diagnosis covid-19 and isolation of the patientsthis telephone severity scoring system had a limitation regarding the accuracy of the assessment of patients however anosmia and ageusia are not ambiguous symptoms our report had a relatively large number of patients and focused on the time pattern on the recovery of these symptomsin conclusion anosmia and ageusia seem to be part of important symptoms and clues for the diagnosis of covid-19 particularly in the early stage of the disease the acute anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized as important symptoms of the covid-19 infectionamong patients with asymptomatic-to-mild disease severity the presence of anosmia or ageusia may be an important differential presentation for the suspicion and diagnosis of covid-19 and these symptoms may recover within 3 weeksa series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in wuhan in late december 2019 1 epidemiological data demonstrated person-to-person spread is the main mode of transmission which resulted in a worldwide outbreak 23 world health organization who designated covid-19 as the official name 45 the pathogen was confirmed to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 a betacoronavirus 5 standard technique to confirm covid-19 is nucleic acid testing with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr andor next-gen sequencing ngs methods 67 imaging features differ in different individuals and stages of the covid-19 pneumonia and they are also different from other infectious pulmonary diseases 8 in order to improve the diagnosis and treatment we first drew up the guideline for medical imaging in auxiliary diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019and participant in radiological diagnosis of new coronavirus infected pneumonitis expert recommendation from the chinese society of radiology first edition 9 10based on these previous advices this current overview and consensus statement is meant to inform radiologists in the rest of the world based on the chinese experiencein post-mortem cases the lungs show consolidation in different degrees serum fibrinous exudate and transparent membrane formation are seen in the alveolar cavity exudation cells are mainly monocytes and macrophages and multinucleated giant cells are easily seen type 2 alveolar epithelial cells proliferated significantly and some of the cells shed inclusion bodies can be seen in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages alveolar septal vascular congestion and edema monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration and intravascular thrombosis can be seen focal hemorrhage and necrosis of lung tissue may occur with hemorrhagic infarction intra-alveolar fibrosis resulting from organization of inflammatory exudates also can be found the epithelium of the bronchial mucosa in lungs discards and there is formation of mucus and mucus plugs in the cavity coronavirus particles can be seen in the bronchial mucosal epithelium and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells under an electron microscope 11 12the incubation period is 114 days mostly 3-7 days based on the current epidemiological evidence 13 fatigue and dry cough are the most common clinical onset symptoms nasal congestion sore throat and diarrhea are atypical clinical presentations 13 patients with mild or moderate type only demonstrate a low fever and mild fatigue without pneumonia in the early stage of the disease 1314 most patients have a good prognosis with few patients becoming critically ill prognosis is poor for the elderly and those with chronic underlying diseases and the symptoms of children tend to be relatively mild 1516 some critically patients may have elevation of troponin level and an increase of c-reactive protein can be seen critically ill patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock with metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction that are difficult to correct 1617 for the clinical criteria the first step is to ascertain the epidemiology history of suspected cases confirmed cases must be tested positive by rt-cpr assay or by ngs 18 sars-cov-2 nucleic acids can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs sputum or other lower respiratory tract secretions blood and stools 19mild type clinical symptoms are mild and no signs of pneumonia are seen on imagingcommon type fever respiratory infections and other symptoms pneumonia can be seen on imagingsevere type any of the following conditions1respiratory distress rr  30 timesmin2resting-state oxygen saturation 933arterial oxygen partial pressure pao2oxygen concentration fio2  300mmhg
critical type any of the following conditions1respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation2patient suffers from shock3combined with other organ failure requiring icu monitoring and treatment
in western countries ct is not considered a screening examination for covid-19 20 21 22 due to various factors such as specimen collection technology kit quality and the diversity of disease evolution the false-negative rate of nucleic acid detection is relatively high in china in the situation of suspected crowds and limited medical resources nucleic acid test negative but ct positive highly suggestive of viral pneumonia are also listed as medical isolation treatment criteria in china which is more in line with the actual situation in wuhan 189 thus infection prevention and control is a new task and a serious challenge facing the radiology department in china all members must fully understand the epidemic situation and fully grasp the knowledge of infection control the work process and working mode must be changed in accordance with the requirements the radiology department should prepare the requirements of covid-19 imaging examination workflows including but not limited to 1 set up a special waiting area and examination room for covid-19 patients 2 require all radiologists technologists and nurses to master skills of prevention of covid-19 infection 3 formulate emergency ct examination specifications procedures and disinfection measures for patients with suspected covid-19 4 require self-protection measures for all radiologists technologists and nurses 7 regulate disposal of waste protective equipment it should be emphasized that in order to prevent cross-infection hospitals should clearly divide the polluted area semi-polluted area and clean area according to the requirements of nosocomial infection control and set up independent inspection areasimaging in particular chest x-ray and computed tomography ct is important in the detection of lung lesions assessment of lesion size density and evolution chest x-ray examination is convenient and fast and has been proven effective in diagnosing other coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 23 24 25 26 however the sensitivity and specificity for mild type patients are relatively low 27 it is not recommended for patients with early covid-19 stage chest ct scans can demonstrate almost all abnormalities including early mild exudative lesions chest ct is the most valuable imaging tool for the clinical diagnosis of early stage covid-19 pneumonia when patients symptoms are aspecific especially in wuhan with insufficient pcr tests in the early pandemic period 2829 it is recommended to use volume ct with a maximum acquisition slice thickness of 5 mm 16 slice multi-detector ct and a reconstruction slice thickness of 10 to 15 mm 30 multi-planar reformats transverse sagittal and coronal planes are beneficial for the early detection of lesions in patients with negative nucleic acid tests 9multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes in the lower zone of lungs are typical imaging features in common type patients 9 with the progression of the disease it may manifest as a patchy distribution or multiple consolidations 132731 in severe and critical type covid-19 pneumonia multifocal or diffuse consolidation can be seen in both lungs showing as white lung 16 chest x-ray is only suitable for primary hospitals without examination conditions and follow-up of critically ill patientstypical features on chest ct include ground-glass opacity with a cloud-like change on chest ct not obscuring the accompanying pulmonary vascular structures in lungs 3233 corresponding pathological changes are exudation in the alveolar cavity with partial filling of the air cavity mainly from serous and fibrinous exudates alveolar septal vascular congestion and edema disease progression mostly occurs in a course of 7-10 days with enlarged and increased density of ggo and consolidated lesions with air bronchogram sign 93435 ggos from the early stage expand and the density increases gradually consolidation shows increased lung parenchymal density and blurred borders of the pulmonary blood vessels and airway walls due to the loss of air contrast the lesion range can be acinar leaflet lung segment or lung lobe lesions are distributed as bilateral asymmetrical subpleural wedge-shaped or fan-shaped mostly in the caudal regions of the lung and dorsal subpleural area 36 when interlobular septa and intralobular interstitium are thickened this is displayed as subpleural reticulation according to a crazy paving pattern 38 39 40 the underlying pathological changes are pulmonary edema protein exudation thickening of intralobular interstitial and multinucleated giant cells and macrophage infiltration in the alveolar cavity 37 critical stage disease may show further expansion of consolidations with the whole lung showing increased opacity a so-called white lung 935 in recovery stage patients the lesion area is reduced and absorbed or only residual fibrous lesions are seen 38 less common findings include pleural effusion stretch bronchiectasis and thoracic lymphadenopathy imaging examples are shown in fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 fig 4 fig 5
chest ct can also evaluate the time course of covid-19 and assess the evolution of disease severity chung et al 34 evaluated each of the five lung lobes and determined the degree of involvement and rated the severity of each lobe the patients who had the highest score of 19 were admitted to the intensive care unit with multiple bilateral ggos and subsegmental consolidation pan et al 28 investigated the time course of lung changes during recovery from covid-19 pneumonia the results showed that with the evolution of the disease ggo would enlarge with a crazy paving pattern and partial consolidation lung involvement reached a maximum at about the 10th day after the onset and the crazy-paving pattern was resolved entirely in the absorption stage about the 14th day after the disease onset which means that the crazy-paving pattern may become an important indicator for evaluation of disease evolution other studies focusing on the evolution of covid-19 pneumonia concluded that the lung segments showed marked changes with decreasing of ggos and increasing of crazy-paving pattern and consolidation 939 40 41 42 patients recovering from covid-19 can be tracked with ct to assess for long-term or permanent lung damage including fibrosis imaging examples are shown in fig 6 fig 7
although the imaging features of covid-19 overlap with those of sars and mers there are differences on imaging exams that set the covid-19 pneumonia apart it is essential to make a differential diagnosis for early identification of borderline patients and determination of the appropriate treatment viral pneumonia is characterized by alveolar wall edema and interstitial changes 43 streptococcus pneumonia is characterized by the consolidation of lobes or lobules without ggo 44 both mycoplasma and aspiration pneumonia distribute along the bronchovascular bundle 45 46 47 which is significantly different from covid-19 pneumonia in a study comparing chest ct from 219 patients with covid-19 pneumonia in china and 205 patients with other causes of viral pneumonia in the united states covid-19 pneumonia cases were more likely to have a peripheral distribution 80 versus 57 percent and ggo 91 versus 68 percent 8 covid-19 patients more frequently had multifocal involvement on ct compared with unifocal involvement in sars and mers 242648 table 1
shows the differential diagnosis between covid-19 pneumonia and other respiratory diseasea large amount of ct images makes it difficult for radiologists to compare among serial studies thus rapid detection accurate location of lesions and evaluation of lesion size properties and lesion dynamics are urgent issues that need to be addressed an ai-assisted diagnostic system for covid-19 has been developed in china it takes about 15 seconds with an accuracy rate above 90 49 the ai-system has outstanding performance in the detection of subtle ggo which is the most easily missed typical ct feature of covid-19 also it can precisely segment the lesion region calculate the lesion volume volume rates of lesions to totalleftright lung and each lung lobe comparing ct scans of the same patient at several time points the radiologist can use the system to measure changes in each lesion and track the progression of the disease fig 8
 some researchers have tried to apply ai in ct image analysis to differentiate covid-19 from other viral pneumonia patients 50 with clinical symptoms laboratory testing results and contact or travel history the ai system can help doctors identify patients with risk of progressing to a more severe disease state at the time of admission for timely precise and effective treatment decisions hence precise lesion labeling segmentation and quantification analysis of covid-19 lesions is the future of aiin general combined chest ct clinical symptoms and laboratory tests facilitates the diagnosis of covid-19 increasing in-depth understanding of the disease research and the continuous improvement of ai technology will further promote the establishment of a comprehensive prevention and control system of early screening diagnosis isolation and treatment of covid-19 pneumoniathis work was supported by national science foundation of china no 62041601the authors declare that they have no competing interestson january 30 2020 the world health organization who designated an outbreak of a novel coronavirus not seen before in humans to be a public health emergency of international concern pheic this was followed by the declaration of a pandemic on march 11 2020 12 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 previously referred to as 2019-ncov is the virus responsible for causing coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 3 4 5 6 7 the pandemic traces its early beginnings to the report of a cluster of 27 unexplained pneumonia cases in late december 2019 originating from a seafood and live animal market in wuhan hubei province china 8 9 10 11 from the outset the causative agent was thought to be viral with most patients reporting fever or dyspnea 911 with unprecedented numbers of individuals under travel restrictions or quarantine worldwide spread and no known cure or vaccine yet available covid-19 has proven a formidable adversary 1213 14 15the ebola virus disease evd outbreak of 2014 in west africa provided valuable lessons with regards to emergency preparedness personal protective equipment use and triage processes and underscored the important role that emergency physicians play on the frontlines of emerging infectious diseases 16 17 18 we describe the virology epidemiology clinical presentation radiographic and laboratory findings current testing protocols and management of patients presenting with covid-19 to the emergency department ed in this review article we provide emergency physicians with best practices based on the rapidly evolving body of literature surrounding covid-19sars-cov-2 is a member of the coronavirus family named for the crown-like appearance of spikes on the virus surface 519 other members of the coronavirus family include middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-1 as well as coronaviruses responsible for the common cold fig 1 fig 2
 56819 like mers-cov and sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus and is likely associated with an animal reservoir eg bats 6814 while an exact animal source has not been confirmed for covid-19 many of the early cases in china were linked to a live animal and seafood market 6142021the majority of initial covid-19 cases were associated with travel to hubei province china however a growing number of cases due to person-to-person transmission have been reported both in and outside of china fig 3
 8142223 up to 94 of covid-19 cases were reported to originate from hubei province in december 2019 as of march 2020 the greatest number of new cases are now being reported in italy spain germany and the united states us fig 3 fig 4
 24 25 26based on what is known about other coronaviruses experts believe covid-19 primarily spreads from person-to-person through close contact approximately 6 ft by respiratory droplets 48142327 transmission of the virus through contaminated surfaces or fomites with subsequent contact with the eyes nose or mouth may also occur 142327 patients are felt to be at highest risk of spreading the illness when they are most symptomatic 2327 limited data support viral shedding in asymptomatic patients while increased levels of viral shedding may be more pronounced in those critically ill 28 29 30 current epidemiologic patterns of covid-19 in china indicate that it is highly contagious with sustained spread the extent of person-to-person transmission within the us was initially limited but has progressed now to community transmission in many parts of the country 23 the current r0 or basic reproduction number is estimated to be 22 for every case of covid-19 identified in the population 2 additional cases are possible in the absence of adequate isolation 2031 32 33in an early epidemiologic analysis of 425 covid-19 cases in wuhan china the median patient age was 59 years and 56 were male 20 in the largest study to date of covid-19 comprising over 72000 patient records up to february 11 2020 from china 866 of patients were 3079 years of age 34 while 809 of these cases were reported to be mild the overall case fatality rate was 23 34 few pediatric cases of covid-19 have been reported with patients aged 019 years representing just 21 of all cases 3435 approximately 38 of laboratory confirmed cases of covid-19 occurred in healthcare personnel and 146 of these cases were either severe or critical 34 to be classified as severe the following characteristics were required pao2fio2  300 oxygen saturation  93 presence of 50 lung infiltrates within 2448 h respirations 30 breathsmin or dyspnea 34 critical patients defined as those with septic shock multiple organ dysfunctionfailure andor respiratory failure accounted for approximately 5 of the study population with a case fatality rate of 490 3424 the highest case fatality rate was observed in those older than 80 years 148 34 patients without comorbidities had a case fatality rate of just 09 in contrast to those with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease 105 34caution should be exercised in interpreting early findings as underreporting and variable testing practices have been a concern with covid-19 3637 case fatality rates in hubei province have been reported to be 18 95 confidence interval ci 1118 while those outside mainland china range from 1251 38 mortality rates have been calculated to be as high as 1115 3940 when compared to other recent epidemics such as sars 956 or evd 3953 the average case fatality rate 42 for covid-19 is much lower table 1
 4142 in comparison the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic and 2017 influenza season were responsible for approximately 220 times more cases 4142based on what is known about similar coronaviruses the longest potential incubation period for covid-19 is thought to be 14 days from initial exposure 46 the mean incubation period is 52 days 95 ci 4170 but can range from 2 to 14 days 42043 co-infections occur in 2233 of patients and may be higher in critical patients 4445risk factors for severe covid-19 disease include advanced age chronic medical conditions immunocompromise and cancer 46data regarding pregnancy and covid-19 are limited 47 pregnant women and fetuses may be more vulnerable to covid-19 infection compared to the general population 48 there are case reports of pregnant women diagnosed with covid-19 complicated by adverse outcomes including preterm birth 47 historically infants born to mothers with other coronaviruses such as mers-cov or sars-cov-1 have been small for gestational age or preterm 47 newborn infants are also an at-risk population 48occupational exposure to pathogens is an inherent risk of working in healthcare settings 49 during the 2003 sars outbreak 9 of healthcare professionals hcps in toronto canada participating in endotracheal intubation of infected patients became infected themselves 50 in another study 77 of sars patients in toronto had ties to the hospital setting and 51 of cases were hcps 51 during the h1n1 influenza pandemic hcps were significantly more likely to develop infection odds ratio or 208 95 ci 173251 with a pooled prevalence of 63 52 as covid-19 has disproportionately affected hcps emergency physicians must be vigilant about potential exposure risks and adhere to appropriate infection prevention precautions 5354 in italy anywhere from 8 to 30 of hcps have been infected with sars-cov-2 5556the symptoms of covid-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses and include fever cough fatigue and dyspnea 6843 the differential diagnosis for covid-19 should be tailored to the patient and their presenting symptoms and comorbidities influenza respiratory syncytial virus rsv other viral illnesses and bacterial pneumonia should be considered as well as other pulmonary diseases ie pulmonary embolism completing a thorough yet focused history and physical examination and obtaining collateral history from family members are vital aside from pulmonary symptoms patients with covid-19 may initially present with more vague complaints including diarrhea lethargy myalgias and nausea 4057 patients may also experience headache confusion vomiting pleurisy sore throat sneezing rhinorrhea and nasal congestion 4058 a case series of 41 patients median age 490 years with covid-19 from wuhan china found the most commonly reported symptoms were cough 76 fever 98 or dyspnea 55 39 in the same case series patients also reported myalgiasfatigue 44 productive cough 28 headache 8 hemoptysis 5 and diarrhea 3 39 in a nationwide study of covid-19 cases from across china the most common presenting symptoms included cough 68 fever 44 fatigue 38 sputum production 34 and shortness of breath 19 59 fever was not a predominant symptom at the time of initial presentation in patients with more severe disease dyspnea may be present in 37 of patients and progress to acute lung injury in 15 of patients 60 one study of 204 patients with confirmed covid-19 suggests 485 of patients have gastrointestinal gi symptoms 61 these symptoms may include anorexia 838 diarrhea 293 vomiting 08 and abdominal pain 04 seven of the 204 patients had only gi symptoms with no respiratory symptoms 61atypical presentations of infection in general may be more likely in the elderly and immunocompromised who may not mount a febrile response 6263 to increase sensitivity and identify potential covid-19 patients sooner the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends using a temperature cutoff of 1000 fo 64 patients older than 60 years of age and those with comorbidities may also present with more severe disease compared to other populations 58three major trajectories for covid-19 have been described mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms non-severe pneumonia and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome ards necessitating aggressive resuscitative measures 65 anywhere from 17 to 29 of patients may develop ards 3940 other complications of covid-19 include secondary bacterial infection acute kidney injury septic shock ventilator-associated pneumonia and cardiac injury 3940emergency medical services ems directors and public health authorities working in conjunction with the cdc will need to modify emergency preparedness strategies to address covid-19 68 emergency medical dispatchers should consider whether callers describing risk factors and symptoms concerning for covid-19 should be identified as a potential pui 3068 if so ems personnel arriving on-scene as well as hcps at the receiving hospital should be notified immediately to ensure proper personal protective equipment ppe use and confirm that appropriate isolation facilities are available 3068 once contact is made with the patient initial triage and assessment should be done at least 6 ft or 2 meters away and minimized until the pui dons a facemask 68 in addition to limiting the number of ems personnel in the patient compartment those providing any direct patient care should follow standard droplet surgical mask and contact precautions gown and gloves while wearing eye protection face shield or goggles 68 airborne precautions n95 respirator should be employed if the patient is critically ill andor if an aerosol-generating procedure is anticipated during transport ideally transport vehicles with isolated compartments or high efficiency particulate air hepa filtration should be used and the patient should be transferred directly to a treatment room on arrival at the receiving healthcare facility 68 after the patient has been transported and ems documentation is being completed patient compartment doors should be left open to allow proper ventilation 68 when cleaning the vehicle disposable gown gloves surgical mask and face shield should be worn 68 routine cleaning should be followed by application of a hospital-grade disinfectant preferably one approved by the us environmental protection agency epa for use against emerging viral pathogens including sars-cov-2 68patients presenting with symptoms concerning for covid-19 to the ed should be separated from other patients by at least 6 ft or 2 m and asked to wear a facemask 6269 ideally stable covid-19 puis would be identified at time of check-in or triage and then placed in a private room with the door closed 3064 critically ill patients and those requiring aerosol-generating procedures should be placed in an airborne infection isolation room aiir also known as a negative pressure isolation room with hepa filtration of the recirculated air 3069 once a pui is identified the appropriate health department or agency and institutional personnel should be notified in an expeditious manner 6267 movement into and out of the patients treatment room should be limited to only essential hcps involved in patient care 69 while in the room the pui may remove their facemask 69 however it is reasonable to ask the patient to wear a facemask during interactions with hcps eg performing a physical examination in the room as tolerated to contain respiratory droplets generated from coughinghcps should either use alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash their hands with soap and water before and after contact with a covid-19 pui 6269 they should be trained in the appropriate use of ppe per hospital guidelines including techniques to safely doff equipment protecting mucous membranes 69 when caring for a stable pui hcps should adhere to droplet surgical mask contact gown and gloves and standard precautions with the addition of eye protection face shield or goggles 857626469 if a pui is critically ill or an aerosol-generating procedure eg endotracheal intubation suctioning of the airway sputum induction is necessary hcps should escalate to airborne precautions with the use of a fitted n95 respirator in place of a surgical mask 626970 reusable respirators such as powered air purifying respirators paprs may also be used but should be disinfected and maintained appropriately 69 patients with a history of covid-19 exposure presenting with non-infectious symptoms may be evaluated and treated in adherence to standard precautions alone 64if portable studies eg plain radiography cannot be completed within the patients room or the patient requires transport elsewhere within the ed or hospital by wheelchair or stretcher hcps should don appropriate ppe 6470 healthcare professionals at the destination or receiving location should be made aware of the patients arrival and likewise don appropriate ppe 6471 patients leaving their treatment room should wear a facemask be dressed in a clean hospital gown when possible perform hand hygiene and be educated in proper respiratory hygiene 71personnel cleaning empty pui rooms should follow droplet contact and standard precautions with eye protection as infectious particles may be present 63 it is unclear how long sars-cov-2 remains in the air but drawing parallels from other airborne disease such as tuberculosis can be helpful particularly if an aerosol-generating procedure has been performed 63 frequently used surfaces should be cleaned at least twice daily with implementation of standard institutional cleaning procedures 71intubation is a high-risk procedure due to the aerosolization of respiratory droplets 3072 rescue intubations should be avoided whenever possible as complete adherence to ppe may be inadequate in a time-sensitive critical scenario 72 society of critical care medicine sccm surviving sepsis covid-19 guidelines recommend performing endotracheal intubation under airborne precautions including use of a fitted n95 respirator and placement of the patient in an aiir 70 based on prior cases of hcps infected with sars-cov-1 while using n95 respirators some experts recommend using a papr 72 the most experienced provider should intubate 7072 to reduce inadvertent contamination by touching ones face or hair a full face shield and head cover is recommended if a papr is not used 3072 wrist exposure can be minimized by using longer-sleeved gloves or vertically taping gloves to the gown 30 applying tape circumferentially makes removing ppe more difficult and does not have added benefit 30 shoe covers should be avoided as they can lead to accidental self-contamination instead impermeable shoes that can be appropriately decontaminated should be worn 30 if available coveralls with or without a hood may be used but processes and training in safe doffing should be established beforehand as hcps may be less experienced in using these ppe ensembles 30hcps may consider double gloving and positioning waste and other transport receptacles close by to limit droplet andor contact transmission when securing contaminated equipment for disposal or reprocessing 72 preoxygenation should be optimized with non-aerosol generating strategies including head of bed elevation jaw thrust and use of positive end expiratory pressure valves fiberoptic laryngoscopy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary as atomization of anesthetic will cause the virus to become aerosolized 72 preoxygenation for at least 5 min with 100 oxygen before performing rapid sequence intubation rsi may be used with nasal cannula though this may increase the risk of contamination 3072 to reduce this risk a surgical mask can be placed on the patient over the device non-invasive positive pressure ventilation nippv may increase risk of aerosolization and is not recommended for preoxygenation 3072 a high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be used between the facemask and the rest of the respiratory circuit 72 video laryngoscopy is preferred to direct laryngoscopy to increase distance between the intubator and the patient 3070 a closed system should be utilized for suctioning once the intubation is complete the emergency physician should immediately place the laryngoscope in their outer glove along with all other equipment used for intubation in a double zip-locked plastic bag 72 the presence of a high-efficiency particulate air hepa filter should be verified in the expiratory limb of the mechanical ventilator prior to patient usethe cdc has developed a real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay for detecting sars-cov-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens obtained from covid-19 puis 73 74 a nasopharyngeal swab specimen should be collected for testing 75 for lower respiratory tract specimens sputum can be obtained from patients with productive cough otherwise bronchoalveolar lavage or tracheal aspirate can be substituted 75 serum samples are not necessary 7576there are few data available regarding sensitivity and specificity for the test but false negatives may be seen in asymptomatic individuals or those early in the course of their disease who may not have high viral burden 27 patients who test negative for covid-19 using a sample taken while they were symptomatic likely do not have the disease 6 however the sensitivity of rt-pcr has been reported to range from 66 to 80 77 a single negative rt-pcr should not be used to exclude the diagnosis especially if the patient is in the early stages of the disease with no severe symptoms a patient with negative rt-pcr with continued suspicion of covid-19 should be isolated and rechecked several days later molecular testing eg respiratory virus panel for alternative diagnoses such as influenza should be considered for all puis 67 however co-infection with other viruses may occuranemia lymphopenia hypoxemia abnormal kidney and liver function elevated creatine kinase and d-dimer thrombocytopenia and increased lactate dehydrogenase can be present 394058 lymphocytopenia can occur in up to 80 of patients 60 interestingly one study found procalcitonin was elevated in just 6 of patients while other inflammatory markers like serum ferritin and c-reactive protein were elevated 40 troponin and brain natriuretic peptide may be elevated in those with cardiac involvement and should be obtained in patients with suspected myocardial infarction or heart failure 78advanced imaging such as computed tomography ct is not required for diagnosis and may create additional infection prevention challenges in the ed however if obtained ct may demonstrate several findings lung findings may be present on imaging before patients develop clinical manifestations in a case series of patients from wuhan china admitted with covid-19 100 had chest ct findings consistent with pneumonia 39 patients may also have radiographic ground-glass opacities 58 another study of 99 covid-19 patients found 75 of patients had bilateral pneumonia 25 had unilateral pneumonia and 14 had mottling and ground-glass opacities on chest x-ray and ct imaging 40ultrasound can be utilized as well as it is repeatable and reliable has no radiation and is inexpensive ultrasound findings depend on the stage and severity of the disease and it cannot detect lesions deeper in the lung patients with covid-19 typically demonstrate an irregularthickened pleural line scatteredconfluent b lines consolidations of various sizes and both non-translobar and translobar consolidations on lung ultrasound 79 pleural effusions are typically small and localized if they are present and abnormalities are typically found in multiple lung zonescurrently no specific treatments exist nor are recommended for patients with covid-19 41562 several vaccines are under study including dna-based vector-based and protein based vaccines 80 supportive care is the mainstay of treatment preferably with acetaminophen 415 if pneumonia is present on imaging or the patient is critically ill antibiotics are recommended patients presenting with respiratory insufficiency in the setting of potential covid-19 infection should be given supplementary oxygen to maintain an oxygenation saturation 90 but no higher than 96 6270 up to 76 of patients require oxygen therapy 40 for those with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who require intubation endotracheal intubation should be performed for those with hypoxemic respiratory failure who do not require intubation but who do not improve with conventional oxygen therapies high flow nasal cannula hfnc is recommended over noninvasive positive pressure ventilation nippv 70 if hfnc is not available and there is no urgent need for intubation a trial of nippv ventilation is recommended with frequent reassessment though nippv increases the risk of aerosolization 70 nippv may result in patient improvement the sccm does not make a clear recommendation for helmet nippv compared to mask nippv 70 while most recommend avoiding nippv due to the risk of aerosolization it can be utilized safely if high risk patients are cohorted and clinicians use appropriate ppe 81 patients who decline despite use of hfnc or nippv should be intubated 70 if intubation is indicated airborne precautions should be used with the patient ventilated using tidal volumes of 48 mlkg of predicted body weight and plateau pressures 30 cm h2o 62 if available patients with severe ards may benefit from prone ventilation 12 h per day 6270over-resuscitation with intravenous fluids should be avoided which can potentially worsen oxygenation 62 even when covid-19 is suspected as the cause of the patients symptoms the who recommends administering empiric antibiotics and a neuraminidase inhibitor within 1 h of identifying sepsis 62 early recognition of septic shock is critical with management of sepsis focusing on intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics 62 a conservative resuscitation strategy with bufferedbalanced crystalloids is recommended for those in shock and hypotonic crystalloids should be avoided 6270 vasopressors preferentially norepinephrine are indicated for persistent shock with a goal map of 6065 mmhg 6270 for those with continued shock despite norepinephrine vasopressin should be added rather than increasing norepinephrine dose 70 if cardiac dysfunction is present and there is persistent hypoperfusion dobutamine is recommended 70 systemic steroids hydrocortisone 200 mg per day should be considered in those with vasopressor-refractory shock or for those with another indication for steroids such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation 226270 without delaying antibiotic administration bacterial blood cultures should be obtained 62clinical trials of investigational drugs and antivirals are underway although none are currently approved by the us food and drug administration fda table 4
 446 remdesivir has demonstrated activity against mers-cov and sars-cov in vitro and animal models 8283 an in vitro study found that remdesivir and chloroquine inhibit viral infection but further study is required 8485 results from a single study of over 100 covid-19 patients found chloroquine was superior to control in reducing pneumonia exacerbation improving imaging findings and virus-negative conversion and shortening the course of the disease 86 a study evaluating lopinavir-ritonavir found no improvement in patient survival or differences in detectable viral rna 87 hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are also under study 88 in a single prospective observational study of 36 patients with covid-19 those receiving hydroxychloroquine demonstrated higher rates of viral load reductiondisappearance though no patient centered outcomes were assessed 88 other medications under study include tocilizumab and favipiravir 8990 there are no clear data supporting harm or benefit with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ace receptor blockers arbs 9192 unless authorized through a clinically approved trial or monitored emergency use of unregistered interventions framework meuri unlicensed treatments should not be administered 62 continuous renal replacement therapy crrt extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo and immunoglobulin have been utilized for management but have not been definitively shown to be beneficial 40patients with severe symptoms hypoxemia requiring oxygen supplementation or high risk for clinical deterioration ie pneumonia on radiograph severe comorbidities may require admission for further management and monitoring patients with mild symptoms and no significant comorbidities without concern for deterioration of clinical condition may be candidates for discharge self-quarantine for two weeks and home monitoring 93 these patients must have the ability to be safely isolated at home to prevent transmission to others and be carefully monitored 22 social distancing is a vital component of reducing the spread of the virus comprised of limiting events mass gatherings and even small group meeting 94 individuals should remain 6 ft or 2 meters apart from other individuals health departments should be involved early in the care of these patients and can assist with decisions regarding disposition further surveillance and testing especially until confirmatory test results are available 5762 emergency physicians should counsel these patients to return for worrisome symptoms including new or worsening pulmonary complaints and fever 5762 development of a clinical pathway among emergency physicians infectious disease specialists and health departments is critical to safely evaluate covid-19 puis in the communitycovid-19 is a novel coronavirus that has affected an unprecedented number of people to date patients typically present with a combination of fever or cough and have a history of exposure to either a close contact with covid-19 or travel to an affected geographic area while most patients will have mild disease some may develop severe complications including ards and multi-organ failure with some succumbing to the disease special consideration should be given to those at the extremes of age the immunocompromised or pregnant women no curative treatment is currently approved emergency physicians should obtain a detailed travel history from all patients and suspect covid-19 in patients presenting with symptoms of an acute upper respiratory illness and fever early recognition and isolation of a patient with covid-19 in the ed may help decrease exposure to other patients and healthcare personnel future research is necessary to expand our collective knowledge of covid-19 and optimize patient outcomesnonenonesc sl ak and bl conceived the idea for this manuscript and contributed substantially to the writing and editing of the reviewnonea comprehensive electronic literature search was done on pubmed scopus embase cochrane database google scholar and ovid in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalysis prisma guidelines to identify the articles that discussed the neurological presentations and relation with covid19 keywords used were neurology covid19 sarscov2 neurological manifestations nervous system guillainbarre syndrome neuropathy outcomes stroke nerve critical care the search terms were used as keywords and in combination as mesh terms to maximize the output from literature findings a staged literature search was done whereby a separate literature search was performed for each section within this article and all the relevant studies were identified and summarized separately if a paper is reporting on many aspects of covid19 and neurology aspect then the results have been shared between different parts of this review the relevant articles are cited and referenced within each section separately no limit placed on publication time or language of the article all the relevant articles were identified and screened by three authors the results are summarized in narrative manner in each relevant section within the text of this review a summary table of each section is provided where appropriatestudies were included if they have reported outcomes on any aspects of neurology in relation to covid19 the main exclusion criteria were editorials commentary narrative reviews with no reports on case outcomes or proposed treatment method all the studies and data collection were done by two authors aw and ma and disagreements were resolved by consensus and involvement of senior author ahthe respiratory manifestations of sarscov2 are well documented and known there is an increasing body of significant anecdotal evidence suggesting anosmia as being a symptom of sarscov2 giving rise to the possibility that there may be a degree of neurological involvement with the infectionit has been proposed that sarscov2 gains entry to the cns by one of two ways firstly by systemic vascular dissemination and secondly more locally across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone which may or may not have implications regarding the muchreported anosmia that patients with sarscov2 experience
2
 baig et al propose that once in the systemic circulation the virus invades neural tissue due to its properties of neurotropism here it binds to and interacts with angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors in the capillary endothelium
2

there is certainly prescience for sarscov2 possessing such neuroinvasive properties like its sister virus sarscov responsible for the outbreak in 2003 sarscov2 gains entry to cells via ace2 which it binds via spike proteins
2
 ace2 has previously been reported to be expressed in the epithelium of the upper and lower airways alongside the capillary endothelium of the central nervous system cns
3
 a study conducted into the structural integrity of the sarscov2 spike glycoprotein revealed an 10 to 20fold increase in affinity to ace2 when compared to the sarscov spike protein
4
 this could be explained by the fact that whilst structurally similar the two spike glycoproteins are not identical as identified by a blastp search of the two structures
4
 this may also explain why differences in the prevalence of neurological manifestations are being reported between the sister virusesyet it must be noted that not all human cell lines which express ace2 are liable to infection with the novel coronavirus however despite the paucity of data regarding the neurotropism of sarscov2 there is an increasing awareness that its neurological manifestations are something to be recognized alongside its more wellunderstood respiratory presentationgiven the global nature of sarscov2 the lack of any largescale observational studies investigating the cns involvement of the novel coronavirus is surprising numerous individual case reports exist which suggests that some patients exhibit neuropsychiatric complications of the virus such as altered consciousness

 however such reports are limited by their power of the limited published research available most centre in china from the beginning of the sarscov2 pandemic an early study from city of wuhan china of 214 hospitalized patients with sarscov2 reported that over a third 364 of patients had some degree of neurological involvement suggesting that this may be an underreported and overlooked component of the disease course they noted that headache and dizziness were the two most reported cns manifestations at 17 and 13 respectively the incidence of more severe neurological sequelae such as cerebrovascular accidents and seizures was low at 3 and 05 respectively those with severe infections with sarscov2 were found to be more likely to suffer from neurological complications however the authors did not specify the methodology of distinguishing between a severe and nonsevere infection with sarscov2
7

interestingly they noted that most neurological manifestations occurred early on in the disease which may pose to be an important early predictor of future clinical deterioration another similar such retrospective series by chen et al from the city of wuhan described that confusion 9 and headache 8 were symptoms reported by such patients importantly however neurological complaints were significantly less prevalent than the typical respiratory symptoms of cough 82 and dyspnoea 31
8
 more significant and potentially longlasting neurological complications of sarscov2 were highlighted by li et al in a study of 221 patients and 6 developed severe neurological disease ischaemic stroke haemorrhage of cerebral vein thrombosis of which a significant proportion died as a result
9

worryingly oxley et al
10
 reported five cases of large vessel stroke in patients younger than 50 who had a diagnosis of sarscov2 the youngest two patients aged 33 and 37 had no previous medical history two further studies detailing the rate of thromboembolic complications in patients with sarscov2 noted the incidence of ischaemic stroke to be 16
11
 and 25
12
 respectively both authors recognized that the incidence of thrombotic complications was remarkably high for their particular institutions there are clearly additional risk factors predisposing patients with sarscov2 to develop thromboembolic stroke beyond the traditional cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities and those pertinent to a protracted stay within intensive care settingsthe thromboinflammatory nature that sarscov2 predisposes patients to was described by connor and colleagues who reported the coagulative parameters in 16 critically ill patients
13
 they found that fibrinogen 94 platelet 62 and ddimer 100 levels were increased as well as interleukin6 il6 100 they propose a correlation between inflammation and subsequent coagulopathy by il6 and fibrinogen respectively
13
 upon damage to the alveoli an inflammatory state is generated and as a result the production of inflammatory cytokines is released including il6the downstream effects are broadly categorized into two sequelae firstly the production of procoagulative factors and secondly damage to capillary endothelium resulting in dysregulation of its antithrombotic properties both of which result in the formation of microvascular thrombosis that in turn have the potential to embolize systemically
13
 the pathophysiology of prothrombotic states following viral infection has been extensively documented and mirrors the proposed mechanism by connor et al however we must also consider the possibility that the predisposition to coagulopathy and thrombotic events may well be explained by the long stays in itu and consequent immobilitythere have also been eleven confirmed case reports and another potential report of guillainbarre syndrome gbs as being a significant neurological sequelae of sarscov2 of the eleven cases in published literature there is considerable variability in the onset of features of gbs and the typical respiratory symptoms of sarscov2 one paper reported symptoms of gbs at initial presentation to healthcare settings alongside only mild fever
14
 whereas a further nine patients reported symptoms of gbs five to eleven days postdiagnosis with the novel coronavirus
15
 
16
 
17
 
18
 
19

despite the inconsistent onset of symptoms in relation to the diagnosis of covid19 it is reassuring that the majority of reports describe consistent clinical features of marked lower limb weakness over upper limb and loss of deep tendon reflexes with variable sensory abnormalities interestingly however raised cerebrospinal fluid protein was not universal in this cohort of patients and in patients with significant respiratory compromise from sarscov2 measuring vital capacity due to neuromuscular failure from gbs to further support the diagnosis may not be plausibleanother report by zhao et al suggests gbs as a presenting symptom of the novel coronavirus but it is unclear whether this is a true association or merely coincidental
20
 it is well documented that gbs is associated with recent inoculation from a potential range of pathogens which in itself can explain the clinical heterogenicity of the disease
21
 several mechanisms by which a virus induces an acute areflexic state in gbs have been proposed most likely is that antibodies against surface glycoproteins are produced against a pathogen which also respond to similar native protein structures found of the surface of neurones leading to the clinical features seen in gbs
19
 other plausible theories include one described by mcgonagle et al who describe a macrophage activation syndrome also known as cytokine storm and the subsequent hyperinflammation may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of gbs in patients with sarscov2
22

a clear time lag between infection with the primary causative pathogen and development of neurological sequelae is the classic phenotype of gbs and has been described as the postinfectious presentation however it is clear that from some case reports this postinfectious phenotype may not explain why a select number of patients present with either concurrent symptoms of sarscov2 and neurological involvement or those that present with gbs initially zhao et al
20
 proposed a socalled parainfectious profile pattern whereby gbs occurs at the same time of an acute episode of infection this may go some way to explain some of the early onset cases of gbs some of which preceded without significant respiratory involvement and in the absence of a history of any other plausible infection known to cause gbstoscano et al
15
 raised an important point in being able to distinguish between gbs and critical illness polyneuropathy particularly in patients with sarscov2 who have prolonged admission to intensive care these consequences of extended intensive care are typically seen later in the course of major illness than gbs but as we have explored relying on purely time as a differentiator may prove to be difficulthistorical research has shown that coronaviruses do have the potential to induce demyelinating disease in mice albeit a central demyelination type picture
23
 there has been an interesting case of gbs overlapping with bickerstaffs encephalitis documented in the previous merscov
24
 outbreak and a report of a 5yearold developing gbs after contraction of coronavirus oc43
25
 so in combination with animal models previous reports of neurological involvement in sister viruses and current emerging reports it does seem that gbs is associated with the ongoing sarscov2 pandemic but due to so few published reports and the difficulty in proving a direct cause and effect relationship between a single pathogen it may be complex to explore this further in clinical practice the neurological symptoms reported by patients are represented in figure 2the longstay admissions that some patients are currently experiencing may also pose another issue that of postintensive care syndrome pics in particular critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy cipnm case reports from sarscov detail patients who experienced cipnm following infection with the virus
26
 the underlying mechanism though not fully understood is thought to be due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs that results
27
 this mediates the release of proinflammatory cytokines and free radicals which affect the microcirculation of both the central and peripheral nervous system by reducing oxygen and nutrient delivery
27
 it is also important to note that risk factors for pics have been identified and include long durations of mechanical ventilation hypoxia and sepsis features that are common to severe sarscov2 cases
27
 yet no reports detail such symptoms in sarscov2 patients thus far however due to the similarity of the sister viruses this may be a potential longterm complicationcurrent published studies have suggested that neurological involvement in the pathogenesis of sarscov2 does seem to be associated with a more severe infection and subsequent mortality however currently no direct cause and effect has been attributed to neurological deterioration in patients with sarscov2 and this relationship could just as plausibly be explained by association with other multiorgan system failures the direct effect on mortality and morbidity in such neurological involving patients is yet to be elucidatedinterestingly peripheral nervous system involvement by way of anosmia has been shown to be the initial presentation of sarscov2 in 36 of patients a recent spanish casecontrol study these socalled smell and taste disorders std were found to be significantly more prevalent in sarscov2 patients than in influenza patients
28
 this opens the possibility of more prompt isolation of suspected cases and control of the pandemic if the typical symptoms of fever and cough are indeed preceded by anosmia even if only for a select group of peopleit has been proposed that sarscov2 like other viruses such as avian influenza and sarscov can infiltrate the mammalian brainstem via transsynaptic transfer which can lead to dysfunction of the cardiorespiratory centres of brainstem
2
 it has therefore been suggested that cns infiltration of sarscov2 may explain the deterioration of some patients respiratory effort and their subsequent need for ventilation hence close and serial neurological observations as an adjunct to routine serial observations may prove to be an early warning marker of impending deterioration this of course needs further studywhilst respiratory symptoms of sarscov2 are well recognized and subsequently protocols are in place to screen for and manage these scope remains for this to be broadened to cover neurological symptoms of the diseaseas referenced to previously the first paper to describe neurological involvement in sarscov2 patients concluded that symptoms were much more common in patients with severe forms of the disease defined by respiratory symptoms
7
 they also reported that typical symptoms such as cough and lethargy are less pronounced in severely unwell patients
7

the implications this has on current clinical practice are therefore twofold firstly that all patients but especially those with severe sarscov2 must be monitored for the progression of neurological symptoms as this may indicate a worsening of their condition this should also include coagulation parameters as suggested by connors et al due to the predisposition of thrombosis the virus conveys secondly that patients presenting with newonset focal neurology with or without the presence of coryzal symptoms should be reviewed and treated with suspicion of sarscov2 infection this will allow the early detection of the disease and therefore prevention of deterioration or transmissionto fully understanding the impact of sarscov2 on the nervous system it is essential that documentation of all neurological symptoms is collected for patients infected with the disease so that further analysis can be performed into neurological manifestations an aspect of sarscov2 not yet fully understood is the longterm sequelae the virus may have on different systems of the body
47
 
48
 
49
 
50
 again detailed documentation and longterm followup of recovered sarscov2 patients will allow conclusions to be drawn on this areamore data are required to establish the prevalence and importantly the implications of neurological manifestations in sarscov2 patients both short and longterm including mortality rates as more case reports become available we hope a stronger correlation can be established between the two diligent documentation of all neurological symptoms is recommended to help achieve this the mechanism underlying the neuroinvolvement of sarscov2 is also yet to be fully understood and remains an area of interest identifying modes of transmission is essential in possibly reducing spread and establishing novel therapeutics to target the virusthe underlying pathophysiology of neurological manifestations in sarscov2 remains to be fully determined increasing numbers of papers are reporting neurological involvement in patients but more data are required to adequately correlate the two and the impact this has clinically we recommend close monitoring for neurological symptoms and coagulopathy and to have a low threshold for patients presenting with newonset focal neurology as possible carriers of the diseasethere are no conflicts of interest or sources of supportthe january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared a global health emergency for an outbreak of a novel coronavirus sarscov2 that occurred in the city of wuhan hubei province china

 the rapid spread to more than 25 other countries across the world centers of disease control and prevention 2020 and the high number of contagions over 70 000 in only 1 month after the first case report on december 31 2019 is alarming for all the worlds human populations httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019 although the fatality rate of sarscov2 is around 4 lower than previous sarscov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and merscov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus who has highlighted the importance of strengthening collaborative efforts among scientists to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing the epidemic

 coronaviruses belong to the family coronaviridae and are characterized by a positivesense singlestranded rna genome that was released via the community online resource virologicalorg on 10 january wuhanhu1 genbank accession number mn908947 after that four other genomes were deposited on 12 january in the viral sequence database of the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid the genome sequence showed that the virus is closely related to the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome sars agent of the 200203 outbreak of sars in humans this virus family includes a large number of viruses present in rhinolophid bats in both europe and asia these viruses are pathogen of animals such as birds and mammals in humans they typically induce mild respiratory infections generally observed in the common colda workflow of the coronavirus primary screening has been shown in figure 1 a reliable diagnosis of the viral infection is one the most urgent priorities for public health management of the disease spread usually in acute respiratory infection rtpcr is traditionally employed to identify viruses in respiratory secretions a robust detection technology is usually based on realtime rtpcr because it is highly sensitive and specific although it requires infrastructure skilled personnel and at least 46 hours for analysis currently available techniques do not provide results before several hours or even days and the tests require a wellequipped laboratory and trained personnel indeed these methods are not efficient to rapidly screen a high number of individuals in places where thousands of people transit per hours these methods are effective in confirming the infections when symptoms are already present but they are completely inefficient to identify infections at asymptomatic stage the development of a means for a quick and simple detection of this virus in humans is a worldwide priority considering that infections have been observed in world areas such as africa where the scarce health assistance will not be able to control the spread indeed it is important to generate new ideas that will allow the development of new detection prototypes able to quickly identify infected humans and prevent the virus from spreadinga large number of possible hostpathogen biomarkers transcripts mirnas proteins metabolites may be analyzed through different omic tools here we propose the application of a portable instrument based on the analysis of molecular responses at transcript level the proposed approach consists in the adaptation of an existing infield portable technology currently used for realtime detection of viral agents in plants for detection of sarscov2 in confined and contaminated environments for example airports buildings and boats it links translational genomics to technologies potentially enhancing the discovery of sarscov2specific biomarkers while bridging gaps in conventional human virus detection and molecular diagnostics methods an analysis at two complementary levels host transcriptional responses and viral nucleic acid presence may allow clarification of the pathogenetic mechanisms of the viral agent identifying strict and complex causeeffect relationships occurring in the hostpathogen interactions traditional approaches are based on pathogen dnarna and protein detection using respectively pcrbased or proteinbased methods in traditional laboratory instruments however this kind of method is not useful in the quest to reduce the spread of sarscov2 infections because a the virus is not uniformly distributed within human tissues and is therefore often missed when at low titers undetectable with current realtime pcr technologies b the virus has high incubation times 1430 days at asymptomatic conditions having the capability to be highly contagious at this stage c the analysis with traditional methods takes time for sample transport extraction and analysis 1624 hours at least reducing the speed of viral spread counteracting actions and d the need of skilled personnel to perform analysis the proposed strategy is focused on the analysis of human responses that are triggered during viral infection with specific emphasis on the immune responses that are upregulated rapidly after infection and are locally at the site of infection nose nostrils and also at a distance lungs and other organs biomarkers that are associated with such responses can be found both locally and at certain distance from nostrils at the earlystage event of the hostpathogen interaction a stress condition typically occurs such as a inflammatory response due to the activation of recognition mechanisms of pathogenassociated and pathogeninduced virulence factors these early asymptomatic responses are typically linked with changes in both host and the viral agent at transcriptional and the posttranscriptional levels with specific mrna mirna noncoding rna proteins and metabolites activated in response to the pathogen presencethrough the comparison of transcriptomic signatures under asymptomatic and symptomatic conditions genes associated with the beginning of disease symptoms can be identified the molecular processes precede symptoms appearance when human host activate more physiological responses leading to diseaseassociated phenotypic modifications and metabolic problems linked to pathogen virulence factors the human response itself may lead to detrimental effects exaggerating the direct pathogen action or inducing mutually negative actions prevention of sarscov2 disease spread may require a development of portable instruments for rapid easy and reliable detection of viral infections at a presymptomatic stage b development therapeutic methods for destruction of sarscov2 before irreversible negative effects on human health has occurred these approaches may focus on targeting of human immune system and c identification of pathways and bioactive compounds that can stimulate the innate immune responses indeed the proposed approach is to identify and analyze biomarkers modulated in either host or pathogen at early stages of infection when any eukaryotic host is subjected to stress an induced stress response occurs similarly to the host inflammatory response to pathogenassociated and pathogeninduced virulence factors
5
 if the induced stress response is enhanced tissue injury can happen causing to irreversible effects at asymptomatic stages because it is often too late to avoid tissue and organ damages once symptoms appear during the early stages of this condition the induction of immune stressrelated genes and pathways commonly associated with pathogen infection and physiological disorders occur and these genes are typically associated with general early state of stress response other differentially regulated genes at the presymptomatic stage are stress specific and may work as useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of the host health conditions these responses include changes in the key metabolic pathways associated with key indicators of early stages of infection of known pathogens usually this stress condition usually anticipates the manifestation of symptoms associated with diseases for this reason a focus on the analysis of key genes transcripts proteins metabolites or pathways could be used to monitor the human health status these induced biological molecules may be used as biomarkers for both stress identification and recovery the identification of molecules that are early host responses associated in a reversible stress status using portable instruments is the first stage for asymptomatic diagnosis the biomarkers identification needs the analysis of large data sets through webbased applications that queries large public databases of information on transcripts proteins or metabolites modulated in specific biological conditions ie genevestigatorhere we propose the employment of an instrument that is already widely used for plant pathogens

 and could be easily adapted also for the detection of sarscov2 the idea is to use a portable dnabased detection devices not only targeting viral rna but also analyze a pool of early responsive host transcripts this transcriptional fingerprint would greatly enhance early asymptomatic detection of a viral such as sarscov2 having more than 14 days of asymptomatic stage this complementary approach on host and pathogen will overcome the limits of an approach aiming at only target the pathogen dna that is unreliable at asymptomatic stage especially in case of pathogen with systemic diffusion such as viruses a molecular analysis of early human responses may complement traditional methods based on the identification of the pathogen presence enhancing the detection of first infections at asymptomatic stage surely the expression analysis of a single gene of any host does not allow the specific diagnose of infections because there are no host genes strictly specific for a specific pathogen however a pool of responsive host genes might be employed as host biomarkers to quickly identify early alarm stress state better than aspecific methods currently used such the measurement of body temperature for fever detection a biomarker can be defined as a biological characteristic that can be analyzed and considered as an indicator of a particular physiological such as pathogenic processes or responses to a therapeutic intervention in omic sciences a biomarker profile includes a series of transcriptomic proteomic andor metabolomic features linked with a particular stress development of physiological condition combined these characteristics could become a biomarker of pathogenic condition assisting in diagnosis and therapy a systemsbased approach could gain insight into underlying biological regulatory network brn governing interactions between hosts and pathogens heterogeneous omic data sets could be integrated to define a biological regulatory network underlying early host and pathogen biomarkers for asymptomatic detection of the viral infections to assist the biomarkers discovery the vast amount of transcriptomic data available in public databases in response to human coronaviruses will allow a deep metaanalysis using previously customized bioinformatics pipelines ref 8 9 10 11 this work consists of reanalyzing raw data obtained by independent experiments using a normalization and standardization procedure included in a bioinformatics pipeline this work will provide differentially regulated genes from each study finding commonalities and differences in genes genet sets pathways and geneprotein networks to clarify molecular mechanisms in hostpathogen interactions
12

the genome sequence of sarscov2 is closely related to that of sarscov like sarscov and merscov sarscov2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus
4
 
13
 having a genome size of 30 kilobases similarly with the other coronaviruses encoding for multiple structural and nonstructural proteins
14
 
15
 in addition sarscov2 seems to have similar cell entry mechanism and type of human cell receptor

16
 
17
 t cells respond well against the structural proteins that are most immunogenic compared to the nonstructural proteins
18
 among them the s and n proteins have showed to be the most dominant and longlasting by tcell responses
19
 indeed as possible targets for pathogen nucleic acid detection for bcube we may suggest the following proteins including spike s proteins envelope e proteins membrane m proteins and nucleocapsid n proteins no mutation in sarscov2 sequences as of february 6 2020 has been observed in comparison with the experimentally determined sarscovderived bcell epitopes both linear and discontinuous implying that these epitopes have the potential to elicit a crossreactiveeffective responses against sarscov2
20
 indeed as host response targets we may suggest to test ifn tnf il2 as suggested by previous data
18
 
21
 indeed s peptides showed the highest percentages of ifn producing cellsproteomics may be also used to validate the discovery of transcriptional markers analyzing the same infection stages considered at transcript level a possible technique could be the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation itraq typically employed in quantitative proteomics using tandem mass spectrometry to analyze quantitative measurements of protein amount from different sources in a single experiment briefly once proteins are extracted from the same collected tissues nostril tissues they may be precipitated using proteoextracttm protein precipitation kit calbiochem dehydrated resuspended and digested with tripsin and generated peptides analyzed using a system composed by qexactive mass spectrometer an easylc and a nanospray ionization source data could be acquired using a datadependent msms method and raw data should be analyzed using xtandem visualized using scaffold proteome software and proteins identified using uniprot databases and crap database the use of proteomics should enable identification not only viral proteins but also host proteins modulated by early infection at the same way of transcriptomics a complement approach hostpathogen is required some of the identified pathogen virulence proteins may be selected for further validation through expression in model animals to validate their virulence phenotype synthetic virulence genes should be designed to insure higher in vivo expression through codons optimization ie using dnaworks software httpmcl1ncifcrfgovdnaworks signal peptides could be analyzed by signalp 40 server and nglycosylation sites could be predicted using netnglyc10 httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesnetnglyc this approach has been successful to determine more than 4500 proteins in plants including both host and pathogen

 considering the systemic presence of sarscov2 the identification of specific genes from peripheral blood and different tissues would be very helpful to discover tissuespecific host biomarkers the viral infection is typically perceived by the host before that the viral nucleic acid can be detected by traditional methods such as quantitative realtime pcrhere we propose the use of the portable device such as bcube20 developed by hyris ltdthe device is a miniaturized device that is able to perform both temperature cycles and isothermal analysis enabling a wide array of nucleic acid detection methods such as qpcr and isothermal amplifications figure 2 with a power consumption of maximum 60 w the instrument runs custom thermal cycling protocols and performs realtime pcr analyses the instrument sized 100  100  120 mm with a weight of 115 kg is certified to both european and north american standards thanks to a live sync to a central database it can be monitored and controlled remotely from any device or in mobile with a smartphone the analysis can be performed using customized cartridges to analyze in multiplex way up to 16 or 36 samples of 1025 l in one run on two detection channels famhexthe key features of this system are the following
viral detection in 15 hours using rtpcrautomatic result interpretationhigh resolution melting and isothermal amplification optionswireless or wired connectivity
the bcube 20 can be controlled by the hyris bapp a multiplatform gui that works on smartphones tablets laptops and pcs with typical operating systems figure 3 key features are the following

this miniaturized instrument has been recently proposed for highly threatening pathogen outbreak in agriculture such as xylella fastidiosa in olive
6
 the instrument has typically been used for the detection of plant viral infections directly in field the novelty is the possibility to use the detection principles and methodologies from the infield detection of plant virus in crops to quick and portable detection of a dangerous viral agent in humans such as sarscov2 the instrument analyzes mrna in 2 hours directly in the field without the need of laboratory infrastructures through the performance of a qrtpcr analysis gene expression could be conducted collecting samples from human nostrils with tools such as cotton swabs confirmation may be performed blood samples rna may be extracted from these collection instruments with a quick procedure using simplified extraction proceduresthe typical workflow for the use of the instrument for pathogen detection is shown in figure 4 results may be provided in approximately 2 hours at the moment the developed software and hardware are used to target the pathogen dna but a next step could be the analysis of host xfregulated genes discovered by metaanalysis works implementation and validation tests of the results obtained directly by the portable device could be conducted analyzing the same tissues with traditional laboratory equipment this work would verify the consistency of the field results delivered by the instrumentthe proposed instrument fits well when a quick easy reliable and inhouse early detection and confirmation is required to rapidly decontaminate environments and initiate quarantine of infected individuals the workflow for a secondary coronavirus screening using bcube is shown in figure 5
 the system is able to detect not only viruses but also specific bacteria proteins and dna molecules an increased or reduced concentration of which in a persons saliva blood and other tissues ie nostrils provide the diagnosis of the sarscov2 infections the most important aspect of this tool is the extreme ease of use and the automatic interpretation of the results the app has an intuitive interface and can guide the operator through every step of the setup and analysis initiation in the analysis is simple and the automatic result interpretation engine can assist the operator in determining the outcome the supplied power source works at both 110 v and 220 v and the power cord can be easily interchanged with the one compatible with the standard of your destination country realtime and remote control of the bcubes is allowed thanks to the connection to hyris bdata service the instrument is well suitable to work on boats and other quarantine environments for the possibility to have results in short time it also fits well in the airports after a quick scan of other symptoms ie fever in order to confirm the presence of the viral infectionswe certify that lorenzo colombo stefano lo priore isabella della noce and simone romano are employees of hyris ltd that produces the bcube instrument described in this articlesince december 2019 the world has been in the grip of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-191 on february 27 2020 the first patient with covid-19 was detected in the netherlands after a trip to northern italy between february 18 2020 and february 21 20202 from then until march 6 2020 another 127 covid-19 cases were identified in the netherlands including 9 health care workers hcws in 2 dutch teaching hospitals in the southern part of the netherlands who received a diagnosis of covid-19 between march 2 2020 and march 6 2020 eight of these 9 hcws had no history of travel to china or northern italy raising the question of whether undetected community circulation was occurring because these findings coincided with the seasonal influenza peak3 and because sars-cov-2 infection in hcws could lead to both sick leave and introduction of the virus into the hospital this finding prompted a demand for testing hcws after initial observations of sars-cov-2 detection in persons with mild symptoms who did not meet the definition for case finding1 screening for sars-cov-2 was implemented to determine the prevalence and the clinical presentation of covid-19 among hcws with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms in these 2 hospitalsthe study was reviewed by the ethics committee brabant the netherlands the study was judged to be beyond the scope of the medical research involving human subjects act and a waiver of written informed consent was granted oral informed consent was obtained from all hcws for sars-cov-2 testing and from sars-cov-2infected hcws for data collection data were deidentified before analysis this study follows the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology strobe reporting guidelinea cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 teaching hospitals 700-bed amphia hospital breda the netherlands 800-bed elisabeth-tweesteden hospital tilburg the netherlands employing 9705 hcws

were reported more frequently compared with hcws who were interviewed during the first week of illness twenty-one hcws 24 had no patient contact during their work and only 3 3 reported having been exposed to an inpatient known to have been diagnosed with covid-19 before the onset of symptoms fifty-four hcws 63 mentioned having worked while being symptomatic until march 7 2020 the first day of the hcw screening 9 patients with documented sars-cov-2 infection were hospitalized in the amphia hospital and 5 in the elisabeth-tweesteden hospital only 3 3 of the infected hcws identified through our screening met the internationally recommended case definition for suspected covid-19 which included a history of travel to china or northern italy when using the definition without travel history to capture community transmission 44 hcws 51 still would not have been detectedthe median real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction cycle threshold value ie the number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold was 270 range 145-385 within the limited resolution in time since the onset of symptoms cycle threshold values tended to be higher in hcws who were tested later in the course of the disease figure 3 cycle threshold values were similar for hcws with and without self-reported fever on the day of testing median 251 vs 276 and for hcws with and without any self-reported symptoms on the day of testing median 270 vs 267this study has several limitations first the screening of hcws was based on the presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in the last 10 days and no data were collected for hcws without these symptoms the observed 1 prevalence in all hcws is thus a minimal estimate the lack of data for asymptomatic hcws also precluded estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the reported symptoms second oropharyngeal swabs were used for testing which may have slightly lower sensitivity than a nasopharyngeal swab7 third only 22 of sars-cov-2infected hcws had recovered by the day of the interview which limits the evaluation of symptoms during the course of the disease however stratification of symptoms by time since the onset of symptoms indicated that coughing shortness of breath general malaise loss of appetite and altered or lost sense of taste were reported more frequently during the second week of illness fourth although the heads of departments and supervisors insisted that hcws had themselves tested when they had experienced fever or respiratory symptoms in the 10 days before the screening testing was voluntary and based on self-reported symptoms this may have led to either overreporting or underreporting of specific symptoms self-report bias overreporting of symptoms would have resulted in the testing of more individuals without sars-cov-2 infection and thus in underestimation of the prevalence in symptomatic hcws underreporting of symptoms on the other hand would have resulted in less testing and underestimation of the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection in the overall group of hcws in dutch hospitals sick leave has no personal financial consequences underreporting is therefore not expected to be substantial in this group of professionals with a high sense of responsibility in addition recall bias is unlikely to have affected the reporting of fever or respiratory symptoms health care workers were not aware of their sars-cov-2 infection status at the time of testing and the recall period was short up to 10 days at the time of the interview however participants had knowledge of their sars-cov-2positive test and recall bias could thus have influenced the spectrum of symptoms reported prospective studies using diaries and if possible documenting symptoms while masking participants for test results may overcome such biasduring the containment phase and within 2 weeks after the first dutch case was detected a substantial proportion of hcws with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with sars-cov-2 likely as the result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread this observation confirms the insidious nature of sars-cov-2 spread given the high prevalence of mild clinical presentations that may go undetected8 the spectrum of mild symptoms present in hcws with covid-19 frequently not including fever suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected covid-19 should be used less stringentlyin december 2019 a series of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 break out in wuhan hubei china since then the covid-19 confirmed cases are increasing rapidly as of february 10 2020 a total of 40265 confirmed cases have been reported in china with another 23589 suspected cases 909 fatal cases and 3501 discharged patients moreover more than 300 similar cases have been identified in other 24 countries on december 30 2019 who announced the event constituted a public health emergency of international concern pheic indicating that a big threat to global health has been posed by the novel coronavirus infectionssars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus that belongs to the family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales 1 up to date six coronavirus species have been identified to infect humans and cause disease among them 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 infections are frequently mild mostly caused common cold symptoms 2 the other two species severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov might cause fatal illness 3 sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronaviruses that infects humans 4 infected patients predominantly presented with fever cough and radiological ground glass lung opacities which resemble sars-cov and mers-cov infections 5a recent publication reported a familial cluster of pneumonia linked to sars-cov-2 which indicated the human transmission of the disease 6 in this family a 10-year-old child had ground glass lung opacification but no clinical symptoms the patient was confirmed to be affected by this novel coronavirus by real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr these findings indicate that some patients with sars-cov-2 infection are asymptomatic if some people have a clear history of exposure regardless of clinical symptoms or if they present suggestive clinical manifestations regardless of history of exposure it is necessary to confirm whether they are infected by chest ct or sars-cov-2 nucleic acid testschest ct plays an important role in timely detecting lung abnormalities allowing for early treatment we aimed at describing clinical and ct imaging characteristics of 90 patients with sars-cov-2 infection and early follow-up appearances of 52 patients we hope our findings will provide useful information for medical imagers to recognize the covid-19 pneumonia and assess its evolutionthe study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki our institutional review board waived written informed consent for this retrospective study that evaluated de-identified data involving no potential risk to patients and no link between the patients and the researchers all patients with laboratory-identified sars-cov-2 infection by real-time pcr were collected between january 23 2020 and february 4 2020 the clinical data analyzed were as follows age sex exposure history comorbid conditions symptoms and laboratory resultsall included patients underwent baseline chest non-contrast enhanced ct in a designated hospital guangzhou eighth peoples hospital an optima ct680 scanner ge medical systems milwaukee wi was used and set at 210 ma and 120 kv with the minimum slice thickness of 1 mm all images were analyzed by two senior chest radiologists with 1520 years of experience in a consistent manner image analysis focused on the lesion features of each patient included a distribution characteristics b number of lobes involved c lobe of lesion distribution d patterns of the lesion eg ground glass opacification consolidation cavitation crazy paving pattern e other signs in the lesion eg interlobular septal thickening air bronchogram sign and f other findings eg adjacent pleura thickening pleural effusion pericardial effusion thoracic lymphadenopathy pulmonary emphysema thoracic lymphadenopathy was defined as lymph node size of  10 mm in short-axis ground glass opacification was defined as hazy opacity that did not obscure underlying bronchial and vascular margins figs 1 and 2 consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of bronchial structures and pulmonary vessels 7 crazy paving pattern was defined as ground glass opacification with associated interlobular septal thickening 8 fig 3 the alterations caused by underlying lung diseases such as tuberculosis lung cancer were not included in this studyfifty-two patients underwent a second chest ct after 16 days mean 35 days these images were evaluated for lesions evolution by two senior radiologists in a consistent manner changes in lung lesions were divided as no change disease resolution and disease progressionthis study included 90 patients 39 men and 51 women median age 50 years age range 1886 years table 1 summarizes patients clinical characteristics most patients had a history of exposure in wuhan or to infected patients exposure history was unknown in 4 4 patients the majority of patients presented with fever and cough six 7 patients were asymptomatic half of the patients hold comorbidities thirty-eight 42 patients showed elevated c-reactive protein patients with decreased white blood cells were more than those with increased white blood cellsbaseline chest ct showed abnormalities in 69 patients and 53 59 patients had more than two lobes involved more than half of the patients presented bilateral multifocal lung lesions with peripheral distribution lesions were inclined to distribute in the lower lobes of the 90 patients included 65 72 had ground glass opacification 12 13 had consolidation and 11 12 patients presented with crazy paving pattern thirty-three 37 patients had interlobular thickening 55 61 had combined linear opacities 7 8 showed air bronchogram sign and 50 56 presented adjacent pleura thickening pleural effusion pericardial effusion cavitation thoracic lymphadenopathy and pulmonary emphysema were uncommon imaging findings in these patients table 2fifty-two patients repeated a chest ct examination after 16 days among them 10 patients 19 had no changes 4 patients 8 had disease resolution and 38 patients 73 had disease progression table 3 in 3 patients 6 with baseline negative scan follow-up ct after 34 days showed bilateral ground glass opacitiesconsidering that the majority of patients had a clear history of exposure in wuhan or to infected patients our data confirmed that sars-cov-2 has the ability for person-to-person transmission 6 9 10infected patients predominantly presented with fever and cough notably some patients 7 were asymptomatic these findings indicated that the absence of clinical symptoms cannot rule out the diagnosis of infection persons with a clear history of exposure to sars-cov-2 regardless of clinical symptoms should be considered for medical observation home isolation and further examination similarly patients with symptoms without a known history of exposure should undergo further examinationsthe numbers of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is rapidly increasing nationwide in china chest ct can detect lung abnormalities with high sensitivity which is quite helpful for early diagnosis of the disease that can trigger early treatment which facilitates the containment of this emergency diseaseour study showed some common ct imaging features in patients affected by sars-cov-2 pneumonia bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with peripheral distribution of note more than half of the patients had multilobar involvement and lesions were more frequent in the lower lobes pleural effusion pericardial effusion cavitation thoracic lymphadenopathy and pulmonary emphysema were uncommon imaging findings in these patientsimaging features of viruses infections usually appear as multifocal ground glass opacities a previous study identified that ground glass opacities on ct images correspond to pathological diffuse alveolar damage 11 histologically the opacity of ground glass may be caused by alveoli filled with blood pus water or cells the ct imaging features of viral pneumonia are associated with the pathogenesis of viral infection most viral pneumonia shares similar imaging features in the same viridae family because of similarities in the pathogenesis 12 sars-cov-2 belongs to the family coronaviridae so as expected the imaging features of sars-cov-2 are similar to sars-cov and mers-cov infection nonetheless unilateral involvement is more common than multifocal involvement in the early phase of sars and mers 13 14 in our study the majority of patients showed multifocal involvement in the initial chest ct scan and this finding is consistent with a recent report 8 however whether this finding is a characteristic feature of the sars-cov-2 distinguished from the other two coronaviruses remains to be confirmed by further studiesthe follow-up ct examination in 52 patients showed that 3 patients who had negative baseline scan rapidly progressed to with bilateral ground glass opacities since there is an incubation period after infection with the sars-cov-2 15 a patient may not present any symptoms and imaging abnormalities during this period at present real-time pcr is used to confirm sars-cov-2 infection from respiratory secretionsin our study few patients initially negative for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test had bilateral ground glass opacities in chest ct scans after a few days patients converted to positive for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test by real-time pcr this points out that patients history clinical manifestations imaging characteristics and laboratory tests are all important elements in the diagnosis of the diseaseour study had some limitations first of all we cannot demonstrate any prognostic role for chest ct because we did not find any correlation between imaging and the course of the disease also 52 patients with short-term follow-up chest ct showed disease progression the imaging evaluation of disease progression is not complete and we will collect more follow-up ct data to observe the evolution and outcome of the disease and provide more imaging information to be correlated with clinical findingschest ct detects minor lung lesions in patients at an early stage of disease demonstrating its utility in guiding the diagnosis in a patient with a history of close contact with a sars-cov-2-infected patient early manifestation of bilateral multifocal and peripheral ground glass opacities on a chest ct scan might be a sign of a 2019 novel coronavirus infection thus chest ct is suggested as an important tool for sars-cov-2 infection diagnosiscoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 infection which is a global pandemic declared on march 11 2020 by world health organization who was reported to have infected 168000 cases worldwide in about 148 countries and territories and killed more than 6610 people around the world as of march 16 2020 1 there is a rapid transmission long incubation period and the containment of the disease is extremely difficult compared to prior epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 2there is a paucity of literature on this pandemic as it is novel we aimed to provide a concise clinical summary of all the quality data relevant to the epidemiology trends in hospitalization and outcomes clinical signs and symptoms diagnostic and treatment methods of covid-19 thus increasing awareness in health care providers at the front-line we also discussed various preventive measures to combat and contain covid-19 effectivelywe conducted a systematic search of published articles from pubmed google scholar databases and in-press literature from google search engine through snowballing there were two independent reviewers each focusing on covid-19 novel coronavirus ncov sars and mers and third independent reviewer to resolve any conflicting article of interest we used the keywords as mentioned above and after stringent exclusion criteria a total of 58 articles including reports from the trusted newspapers and websites most of the articles were single case reports multiple case studies and systematic reviews 11 retrospective studies one meta-analysis three systematic reviews six case series five case reports five newspapers 24 science research articles and rest 3 references from official websitesthe initial cases were strongly associated with the huanan seafood market in which exotic animals were sold for food 3 according to lu et al the virus termed sars-cov-2 shares 88 sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats bat-slcovzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 79 identity with the sars coronavirus and 50 identity with mers coronavirus 4 5 according to chan et al sars-cov-2 is thought to be transmitted via contaminated hands surfaces and aerosolized droplets and extensive human-to-human transmission is evident 6according to li et al the average incubation period is 5 days but is highly variable and can last up to 2 weeks 7 sars-cov-2 is thought to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans from an intermediate host civets and dromedary camels respectively still no source or intermediate host has been confirmed yet via genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis 2 this hypothesis was made because previous coronavirus strains have originated from the rhinolophus affinis bat 8 however xiao et al reported the isolation and characterization of a 2019-ncov-like coronavirus from pangolins manis javanica 9 similarly in october 2019 a viral metagenomic study of pangolins identified severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus sars-cov-related sequences 10 11 according to the study by xu et al 60 of people diagnosed with covid-19 had traveled to wuhan or nearby regions 60 36 had close contact with novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp patients and 4 had no definite exposure 12 according to the study by tian et al 405 of people diagnosed with covid-19 had traveled to wuhan or nearby regions 13 beijing is the fourth most-affected city in china 13according to xu et al their patients with mild common and severe covid-19 were of mean ages of 44 years 55 years and 66 years respectively 12 the age distribution of covid-19 diagnosed patients in the study by tian et al included ages  1 1 1 - 12 3 13 - 44 43 45 - 64 35 and  65 18 13 liu et al described covid-19 in children they analyzed a total of 366 hospitalized patients and 6 six patients of them were positive for covid-19 according to huang et al and chen et al sars-cov-2 seems to have a predilection for the elderly male population and patients with comorbidities 14 15 according to the study published in osong public health and research perspectives 7 of the population were greater than 60 years of age and 93 were less than 60 years of age 16 these findings are summarized in figure 1males are experiencing a higher rate of incidence and case fatality compared to females 17 in a study reported from south korea 46 were females and 54 were males 16 these results for multiple studies are summarized in figure 2xu et al analyzed 50 patients with covid-19 confirmed cases and symptoms included fever 42 cough 20 expectoration 14 fatigue 16 headache 10 gastrointestinal discomfort 2 shortness of breath sob 8 and muscle ache 16 12 fever is the most common symptom 12 tian et al analyzed 262 cases of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr confirmed covid-19 in china and symptoms included fever 82 cough 46 fatigue 26 sob 7 and headache 6 13 in severe cases sob was present in 326 of the patients tian et al reported that the median time of incubation was approximately 7 days 13 the median time from onset of illness to a hospital visit and hospital visit to the defined confirmed case were 45 and 21 days respectively 13 yang et al analyzed 149 cases of rt-pcr confirmed covid-19 in china and symptoms included fever 76 cough 58 expectoration 32 and sob 1 18 however a significant number of patients do present with atypical symptoms 19 including nausea vomiting 1-3 and diarrhea 2-10 3 15chen et al analyzed 99 patients in a retrospective single-center study in wuhan and patients presented with fever 83 cough 82 sob 31 muscle aches 11 confusion 9 headache 8 sore throat 5 rhinorrhea 4 chest pain 2 diarrhea 3 nausea and vomiting 1 15 according to wang et al even though fever is the most common symptom of covid-19 the absence of fever in covid-19 cases is more frequent than in sars-cov and mers-cov infection 20 lillie et al presented a case where symptom onset started with fever which then progressed to sore throat and dry cough followed by diffuse myalgia 21according to the study published in osong public health and research perspectives they analyzed the first 28 cases reported in south korea out of 28 patients 32 reported fever and sore throat 18 cough with or without sputum 18 chills 14 muscle aches 11 generalized weakness and 11 headache at the time of presentation moreover 64 developed pneumonia the incubation period was 46 days 16luo et al analyzed 83 patients confirmed with covid-19 infection in anqing china of these eight patients were asymptomatic at confirmation one of whom did not develop any signs or symptoms during the entire 17-day hospitalization this patient was a 50-year-old female with no comorbidities despite her negative labs and radiological tests her throat swabs and anal swabs were positive of virus nucleic acid for at least 17 days indicating that healthy carriers are very likely a possibility 22 hu et al 23 described clinical characteristics in 24 asymptomatic patients after screening among close contacts in nanjing china out of 24 patients seven patients did have a normal computed tomography ct and had no symptoms during their entire hospitalization the median age of these seven patients was 14 years younger than the rest of the patients the median communicable period is defined as the first day of a positive nucleic acid test to the first day of the negative nucleic acid test it can be up to 21 days in asymptomatic patients 23a case report describing the first case of canada showed that the patient had symptoms of hemoptysis on days 2 through 6 along with fever and non-productive cough on presentation 24 lillie et al presented a case where symptom onset started with fever which then progressed to sore throat and dry cough followed by diffuse myalgia this seems to be the most consistent pathway of symptom onset 21the most common symptoms include fever 83 cough 82 and breathlessness 31 3 according to the chinese centers for disease control and prevention cdc 81 of infections were considered mild and only 12 asymptomatic 3 according to huang et al the current published data indicate a long mild incubation period followed by rapid progression of the disease with 8 days being the median time from initial symptoms to the onset of breathlessness 9 days to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and 10 days to admission to the intensive care 14the clinical signs and symptoms from different studies are summarized in figure 3 and temperature at presentation in centigrade is summarized in figure 4covid-19 is diagnosed via rt-pcr 12 13 25 multiple sources found that a normal to slightly reduced leukocyte count occurred in patients with covid-19 98 12 25 xu et al reported a decreased lymphocyte count in 28 of their patients 12 while yang et al reported leukopenia and lymphopenia in 24 and 35 of their patient population respectively 18 an elevated c-reactive protein crp was reported in 52-55 of the patients 12 18 thrombocytopenia was seen in 13 of patients acute kidney injury was present likely due to dehydration not from the virus directly 21 according to the meta-analysis done by lippi et al elevated procalcitonin levels were associated with almost five-fold increased risk of severe covid-19 infection odds ratio or 476 95 confidence interval ci 274 - 829 they advised that serial measurements of procalcitonin may play a pivotal role in analyzing the worsening of the disease to more severe form 26according to the case report by ruan et al they found a patient with a negative nucleic acid test tested twice 8 days apart as the patient was showing typical ct imaging patterns suspicious for covid-19 and deterioration of symptoms repeat testing on day 11 was positive as exact biological characteristics of covid-19 are still not defined well multiple sampling from multi-sites for the highly suspected population can be useful for covid-19 detection at a much earlier stage 27 specimens should be tested for routine bacterial and viral infections as well as using both upper and lower respiratory tract samples to test for sars-cov-2 3 serological tests are in development and they can be used if rt-pcr is not available 3 as per the case reported by chen et al the oropharyngeal swab test of covid-19 rna turned positive even during the convalescence period in a confirmed case it emphasizes the significance of active surveillance of covid-19 rna for inactivity assessment 28the laboratory results from different studies are summarized in figure 5according to zhang et al in a month out of 1467 suspected patients suspected of coronavirus pneumonia 152 patients 10 had typical imaging findings or positive nucleic acid tests 29 chest ct is an important tool for diagnostic for lung diseases combining imaging with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia because the time of onset of symptoms to ards can be as short as 9 days early recognition of the disease is therefore essential for managementin a retrospective study done in wuhan on 81 patients from december 20 2019 to january 23 2020 they were able to describe the characteristics of the chest ct at specified time points during the disease course they have divided the patients into four different groups as shown in table 1 30 based on the review covid-19 pneumonia is described radiographically as bilateral subpleural ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms ill-defined margins and slight predominance on the right lower lobe it was also noted that the radiological evolution of covid-19 pneumonia is consistent with the clinical course of the disease therefore serial ct could help monitor disease progression the study also pointed out that patients with old age male and with underlying comorbidities as well as progressive radiographic deterioration on follow-up are the risks for poor prognosis 30 according to chen et al the majority 75 of patients had bilateral pneumonic changes on ct imaging 15 guan et al reported 230 out of 1099 20 cases 31 and chung et al reported three out of 21 14 have normal ct scans for patients diagnosed with symptoms along with confirmation of infection with rt-pcr 32 according to a single-center study done by chen et al in 99 patients 75 of patients showed bilateral pneumonia ards developed in 17 and 11 of them died with multi-organ failure 15as per the review of literature the ct scans of the chest showed lesions or abnormalities more commonly found in bilateral lower lobes with the right middle lobe least affected multilobar involvement was seen in 96-98 of the patients 12 25 33 the lesions are mostly located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension into the pulmonary hilum 36 in the periphery and 2 in the center of the lung 12 18 25 these lesions sometimes were accompanied by air bronchograms but rarely pleural effusions 12 33 regarding lobar involvement right lower lobe is most commonly involved in approximately 95 of cases followed by left lower lobe 88 left upper lobe 80 and right upper lobe 73 12 pneumothorax as well as bilateral pleural effusions was identified only in 1 of the patients 25 33 approximately 11 of the patient had normal ct findingsct findings based on the stage of the disease are as follows 12 1 mild novel coronavirus pneumonia patients have no abnormalities seen on a ct scan 2 the early-stage infection which is more common has ground-glass opacities identified in the periphery and about 75 of the patients mixed ground-glass opacity along with consolidation in approximately 53 of the patients nonuniform density with air bronchograms in about 53 and thickened interlobularintralobular septa in 75 of the patients 3 patients who are severe or critically ill have multiple patches of ground-glass opacities as well as consolidation in approximately 69 of the patients and mixed findings in about 77 of the patients in bilateral lungs almost all patients have thickened interlobular septa the patients generally have multilobar involvement bilaterally more commonly in lower and upper lobesapproximately 4 - 10 days after infection most lesions were absorbed with a reduced extent and decreased density with the formation of fibrotic stripes lesions can also become worse starting with ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation in the center of opacities on day 2 progressing to multiple lungs on day 6 with thickened interlobular septa by day 9 the lesions can get worse before getting better ct scan of the chest shows the greatest severity approximately 9 - 10 days after the onset of initial symptoms 25the bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities from various studies are summarized in figure 5patients infected with covid-19 and had multiple medical comorbidities were reported to have higher morbidity and mortality as per the analysis by wang et al involving 138 cases of covid-19 approximately 46 of them have comorbidities and more importantly patients admitted to the intensive care unit had a higher number of comorbidities 72 compared to who did not 37 34 as per the meta-analysis of yang et al involving 46248 covid-19 infected patients the most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension with a range of 10-24 diabetes mellitus with a range of 2-14 cardiovascular diseases with a range of 129 and respiratory diseases around 2 as per the final analysis underlying hypertension cardiovascular disease and respiratory system disease might be risk factors in patients with severe infection compared to patients with known severe infection 35 other studies discussing about comorbidities are summarized in table 2in a case study with 99 patients performed by chen et al 17 of diagnosed patients developed ards 13 required non-invasive respiratory support 4 needed invasive ventilation and 3 needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo 15in a review by tian et al approximately 1 of patients died from covid-19 out of 262 patients all of whom had respiratory failure and were above the age of 50 13 yang et al described that 26 of 54406 in the hubei province in china died from coronavirus vs 0 of 499 patients diagnosed in wenzhou city up until february 15 2020 18 these numbers show that there is a regional difference in mortality of covid-19 as the wenzhou province has more resources than the former yang et al estimated the overall adjusted case fatality rate cfr among confirmed patients to be 3 with a sample size of 8866 36the course of hospitalization morbidity and mortality are summarized in figure 6covid-19 causes increased morbidity and mortality in patients who are elderly with several comorbidities mulbsta score is an early warning model for predicting morbidity in viral pneumonia in 90 days as summarized in table 3 it has a sensitivity of 776 and specificity of 778 it has better predictive ability than curb-65 confusion blood urea nitrogen respiratory rate blood pressure and age greater than 65 years 37xu et al performed high-resolution ct scan on 50 patients admitted with sars-cov-2 it was classified into four types as summarized in table 4 12 tian et al analyzed 262 cases of rt-pcr confirmed covid-19 in china which was classified into three types as summarized in table 4 13an outbreak of a novel coronavirus covid-19 or 2019-cov infection causes significant morbidity and mortality coronavirus-specific treatments and antiviral treatments were very useful for the treatment of sars and mers and should be considered as potential treatments for covid-19 17 there is an emergent need for other treatment options and a review of the literature for alternate treatment to control the disease mentioned belowmultiple vitamin supplements and antioxidants can be considered to reduce the risk of infection vitamins a b thymosin alpha-1 thymopentin can be promising options for the adjunctive treatment of coronavirus and the prevention of lung infection 17 vitamin c supplementation might decrease the susceptibility to respiratory infections as three human controlled clinical trials showed a lower incidence of pneumonia in supplemented groups 17 decreased vitamin d and e in calves had been reported to cause the infection of bovine coronavirus 17 it could be another therapeutic option for this virus selenium with ginseng stem-leaf saponins could induce an immune response to a live bivalent infectious bronchitis coronavirus vaccine in chickens selenium supplementation could be a possible choice for the treatment 17 zinc and pyrithione combination at low concentrations can inhibit the replication of sars coronavirus sars-cov 17type i ifns including ifn-b could inhibit the replication of sars-cov and can be potent inhibitors of mers-cov replication in vitro still no in vivo experiments have been performed 17 ifn treatment was used in 96 of patients 18 ifn- vapor inhalation was administered at a dose of 5 million units for adults two timesday for no longer 10 days 38glycyrrhizin baicalin and ginseng are all chinese medicinal treatments that can help enhance host immunity against covid-19 infection they have been found to inhibit sars-cov in vitro 17covid s-protein uses ace-2 as a sole receptor for entry into human cells monoclonal antibody neutralizes sars-cov and inhibits syncytia formation between cells expressing the s-protein and ace-2 receptor 17 chloroquine is a potent sars-cov inhibitor through interfacing with ace-2 17 chloroquine is a potent sars-cov inhibitor through interfacing with ace-2 17 gao et al described chloroquine as a cheap and safe drug available for more than 70 years which has been shown to have apparent efficacy and decent safety against pneumonia associated with covid-19 in multicenter trials performed in china as per the review of results from 10 hospitals and more than 100 patients they showed that chloroquine phosphate is superior to control in decreasing the exacerbation of covid-19 pneumonia the anti-inflammatory and antiviral property of chloroquine may be responsible for its potent efficacy against covid-19 pneumonia 39chloroquine phosphate is orally administered at a dose of 500 mg for adults two timesday chloroquine was found to block sars-cov-2 infection at low micromolar concentration with a half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of 113 m and a half-cytotoxic concentration cc50 greater than 100 m 40 emodin or promazine blocks interaction between s-protein and ace-2 therefore it could abolish sars-cov infection by being a competitive inhibitor 17morgenstern et al have shown that ribavirin  ifn-b combination has shown to synergistically inhibit the replication of sars-cov in animal and human cell lines 41 kim et al have reported a case of mers-cov successfully treated with triple combination therapy with lopinavirritonavir ribavirin and ifn-alpha2a therapy in south korea 42 remdesivir has been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus in vitro and restrains sars-cov in vivo 17 remdesivir  ifn-b was found to be superior to lopinavirritonavir  ifn-b therapy against mers-cov in vitro and in vivo yamamoto et al have found that nelfinavir could strongly inhibit the replication of sars-cov 43 akerstrom et al have reported that organic nitric oxide could significantly inhibit the replication cycle of sars-cov in a concentration-dependent manner and could be taken via inhalation 44favipiravir is a drug currently undergoing testing to combat covid-19 it was approved for the treatment of novel influenza in china favipiravir is an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor it inhibits the replication of rna viruses like noro arena flavi alpha bunya filo groups therefore favipiravir may have potential antiviral action on sars-cov-2 which is an rna virus a clinical trial involving 80 patients has shown that favipiravir had more potent antiviral action than that of lopinavirritonavir it had significantly fewer adverse events than the lopinavirritonavir group 38remdesivir is a drug currently undergoing testing to combat covid-19 remdesivir is a nucleoside analog and a broad-spectrum antiviral 3 38 animal experiments indicated that remdesivir could effectively reduce the viral load in lung tissue of mice infected with mers-cov improve lung function and alleviate pathological damage to lung tissue 38 wang et al found that remdesivir potently blocks sars-cov-2 infection at low-micromolar concentrations and has a high selectivity index ec50 077 m cc50  100 m si  12987 and had in vitro activity against sars-cov-225 45 holshue et al reported that remdesivir yielded promising results in the treatment of a patient with covid-19 in the united states a recent randomized controlled trial rct is being performed 46 it may also be possible to enhance the protective host immune response to infection 2darunavir is a second-generation hiv-1 protease inhibitor on february 4 2020 researchers in china announced that darunavir inhibited sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 38sars-cov-2 uses the cellular protease tmprss2 receptor sars-cov receptor and ace-2 for entry into target cells as mentioned by hoffmann et al a tmprss2 inhibitor would block entry and thus constitute a treatment option 47imatinib has anti-coronal activity primarily because it inhibits the fusion of virions with the endosomal membrane 38arbidol is orally administered at a dose of 200 mg three times a day in adults and able to inhibit sars-cov-2 infection in vitro in a clinical studylopinavirritonavir is administered 400 mg100 mg for adults two times a day for no longer than 10 days stockman et al reported to inhibit sars-cov reproduction in vitro 3 48ribavirin is administered intravenously at a dose of 500 mg for adults 2 to 3 times daily in combination with ifn- or lopinavirritonavir chu et al suggested that patients treated with the combined therapy had a lower risk of ards and death in patients with sars 49steroids increase viral shedding in patients with mers-cov so who advised against their use in covid-19 other than patients with ards 50 according to current who guidelines they do not recommend corticosteroid use as it did not reduce mortality and potentially delayed viral clearance 3patients who have respiratory tract infections can have coexisting gut dysfunction with more severe infections there is a lung-gut cross-connection this mechanism might also happen with covid-19 infection hence identifying and targeting gastrointestinal microbes can be a new treatment option or at least adjuvant treatment choice 19it has profound antiviral activity and there have been previous reports on its inhibitory effect on both sars-cov and previous strains of coronaviruses it can inhibit 2019-ncovr at a low concentration compared to regular infections without drug treatment the viral rna yields were significantly lower in vitro when using cep thus our data suggest that cep can potently inhibit coronavirus infection at viral entry and post-entry phases 51 cep has low toxicity in animals and has no significant side effects in humans 51mefloquine is an antimalarial drug found to have antiviral activity against both mers-cov and sars-cov in vitro 51 no in vivo trials have been performedselamectin is a topical broad-spectrum anti-parasitic in cats and dogs to control fleas heartworms hookworms roundworms etc the antiviral mechanism is unknown but selamectin could be a 2019-ncovr specific inhibitor 51 no in vivo trials have been performedmechanism of action of cep mefloquine and selamectin is unknown all possible therapeutic options are summarized in table 5an action plan needs to be implemented in every organization to combat the disease at an early stagepatients should be offered to wear a nasal mask irrespective of symptoms when they visit the hospitalit is essential to take travel history for every individual regardless of whether they are having symptoms suspicious for covid-19 either to a different state or a different country the second question is if they have any symptoms of cough either dry or with expectoration increasing shortness of breath congestion fever chest pain headaches generalized body aches and pains the third question is contact with a patient with a confirmed coronavirus infectiondrills and emergency preparedness about covid-19 should be performed in all health care facilities involving providers who will be in touch with covid-19 suspected patients as escalating infection control in a health care setting can effectively prevent health care providers in contracting virus according to cheng et al 2020 a bundled approach involving active and enhanced laboratory surveillance early airborne isolation contact tracing with unprotected exposure rapid testing completely prevented nosocomial transmission of covid-19 53if the patient responds yes to the above questions health care personal entering the room should be appropriately wearing personal protective equipment to encounter a patient suspected covid-19 it is crucial as the disease spread among healthcare providers will result in the rapid spread of the virus thus increasing the morbidity and mortality once the patient is identified as a suspect of covid-19 with presenting symptoms of fever cough congestion chest pain nausea and generalized body aches they should be placed in a negative pressure isolation unit the emergency room physician should order basic labs including complete blood count cbc including a differential cbc complete metabolic panel cmp respiratory viral panel and a portable chest x-ray to rule out other etiologies if other etiologies are ruled out and the patient is suspected of having covid-19 the local health department should be notified and pcr testing is recommendedthe patient should be transported to a negative pressure isolation room in the hospital all isolation rooms should have negative air pressure and specially filtered air containing and eliminating the circulation of the virus in the air all staff should be well educated on the use of cleaning supplies and appropriate cleaning methods all team members involved in patient care should receive regular education on the use of personal protective equipment we should continuously monitor the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc guidelines and adopt best practices as sooner they become available if possible health care professionals should be able to use a robotic mode of delivering medication and checking vitals to prevent the spread of the disease this method helped in containing the disease in patients treated at china in washington dcan emergency covid-19 response team should be prepared in every hospital comprising of a hospitalist infectious disease specialist and pulmonarycritical care physician to help with managing patients daily all the essential up-to-date changes in treatment and management should be delivered to all the health care professionals daily in that hospital and to the community to help in treating other patientsthe mode of transmission is when a patient with covid-19 coughs or exhales they release droplets of fluid which is infected and most of these droplets fall nearby objects such as telephones tables and desks as well as other equipment the public can catch the disease by touching these contaminated objects and later touching the nose eyes or mouth notably this is called transmission through fomites 54 patients can catch it by breathing in droplets if they are standing within 1 m of covid-19 patients they should be visited restrictions at all facilities encouraging people to visit patients by a telephone or electronically we should also encourage people coming to the health care facilities for testingtreatment to limit the number of people who accompanied them since the virus causes significant mortality in older adults with significant comorbidities they should be more restrictions placed on nursing homes such as no visitor policies in a high-risk environment we should encourage social distancing which means avoiding crowds and staying 6 feet away from other people as much as possible we should also cancel or postpone all nonessential community events all travel should be avoided unless absolutely necessary particularly to highly endemic zones of covid-19 according to wang et al those having had close contacts with infections are currently being asked to receive medical observation and quarantine for 14 days 20influenza and covid-19 differ by multiple means the first only 1 of reported cases are asymptomatic and most patients develop symptoms within 2 days from covid-19 with influenza people who are infected might not get sick be due to herd immunity developed over the years 55 the second difference is that covid-19 causes more severe illness than influenza as it is a new virus and community have not developed any immunity which makes more people susceptible to severe infection 5 globally covid-19 mortality is 34 compared to influenza with mortality of less than 1 5 third no vaccines are there for covid-19 at present unlike seasonal flu which has a vaccine currently more than 20 vaccines are in the clinical trial stage fourth contact tracing and containment will possibly help for covid-19 compared to influenza 55 these are the reasons why who recommends everything we can do to contain the virus suggests a comprehensive approach to treat covid-19screening should start in the outpatient setting with patients who should undergo infrared temperature detection before entering a health care facility this type of measurement detects the temperature of the patients head displayed on the device 29 according to zhang et al four criteria should be used for screening patients for covid-19 1 coming from the epidemic area and having respiratory symptoms 2 being part of a cluster of patients with fever and respiratory symptoms 3 contact with a patient with a confirmed coronavirus infection or 4 a temperature above 373 c 991 f 29 contact tracing and testing all the suspected contacts at an early level and isolating them in isolation wards will help in halting disease at the early stages identifying and treating the entire community plays a pivotal role than detecting and single patients in this epidemic testing and identifying individuals even if they have an uncomplicated upper respiratory tract should be advised 50medical professionals treating these patients should take the following precautions including 1 wearing disposable work caps 2 wearing protective glasses or face masks antifog type 3 wearing medical protective masks n95 4 wearing protective clothing or isolation clothing 5 wearing disposable latex gloves double layered 6 wearing disposable shoe covers and 7 strictly implementing good hand hygienein everyday clinical practice the most common phrase heard is covid-19 also called as novel coronavirus as of march 16 2020 a total of 168019 confirmed cases in 148 countries were reported among 87002 more than 3400 deaths of covid-19 have been reported to who outside of china and it exceeded chinas death rate 1 while cases from china have been decreasing according to the recent available data the reported cases from outside of china have been increasing at an alarming rate the number of cases reported were nine times more in the rest of the world compared to china since january 22 2020 12 reviewing the history of the disease as of december 2019 a total of 41 cases of pneumonia of unknown origin have been confirmed in the city of wuhan most of them visited local fish and wild animal market within 30 days of infection in wuhan hubei province china 5 it was first identified and announced as a new coronavirus 2019 ncov by a scientific team lead by dr jianguo xu an academician of the chinese academy of engineering 51 in human coronaviruses there is a spectrum of the viruses which can cause infections ranging from the common cold to fatal diseases including sars and mers which are zoonotic the unique pathogenesis of covid-19 compared to sars and mers is it mainly affects the lower respiratory tract as well as the involvement of the gastrointestinal system causing diarrhea compared to few patients with mers and sars having diarrhea 25it was estimated that covid-19 has a reproductive rate ranging from 224 95 ci 196 - 255 to 358 95 ci 289 - 439 which is correlated to eight-fold to two-fold rise in reporting rate 56 imai et al provided the first estimation of the reproduction factor using r0 of 26 and based on the number of cases in china and those detected in other countries 57 other authors estimated r0 to be 3813 64714 2215 and 26816 20 according to wang et al the model used to calculate r0 was assumed of the model from wuhan china as summarized in table 6 the model used to calculate r0 assumed that there were no new transmissions from animals no differences in individual immunity the time-scale of the epidemic is much faster than specific times for demographic processes natural birth and death and there are no differences in natural births and deaths 20 assuming the epidemic continues to develop with r0  19 26 and 319 from december 1 2019 the number of infections will continue to rise by the end of february 2020 covid-19 cases would be 11044 70258 and 227989 in wuhan china with r0  19 26 and 31 respectively 20 according to reads research r0 for covid-19 outbreak is much higher compared with other emergent coronaviruses 58 we see a decreased trend in rt as discussed in table 6 with effective implementation of public health measures to control the spread of the diseaseafter reviewing cases from hubei province severe covid-19 cases occur mostly in men and many of them do have comorbid conditions including cerebrovascular cardiovascular and diabetes several sequelae were seen including coagulation activation cellular immune deficiency hepatic and kidney injury secondary bacterial infection and myocardial injury lymphopenia and sustained inflammation seen in patients with severe disease and death are most likely secondary to antibody-dependent enhancement ade of covid-19 due to previous exposure to other coronaviruses 30 especially this kind of pattern is also seen in patients who had sars during an epidemic in 2003 40covid-19 is a significant clinical threat to the general population and health care workers worldwide unfortunately knowledge about the novel virus is limited causing lots of concern and panic to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with covid-19 public health and infection control measures are urgently required to limit the global spread of the virus all efforts should be made to slow the spread of the illness in order to provide time for health care systems and the general public to prepare and to develop timely diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines finally although the improvement of internet communication enhances information dissemination it also has the potential to spread misinformation hence we need to educate the public to follow information from a reliable website such as the cdc in the us there are several unanswered questions at present in the management of covid-19 even though several case studies rcts and systemic reviews were done there is no clarity regarding the exact pathogenesis of the disease duration of shedding of virus and the possibility of other contaminant viral infections including influenza as well as secondary bacterial infections the pandemics like covid-19 put stress on every part of society posing significant treat to international health and the economy several vaccines and promising treatments are being tested on clinical trials however the rising number of infected people as well as mortality from it and the highly contagious nature of covid-19 with a prolonged incubation period and asymptomatic carriers shredding the virus makes it challenging to contain the spread at present handwashing isolating and quarantine patients who are exposed or infected with the virus disinfecting the contaminated surfaces as well as extensive public health measures such as avoiding large group meetings closure of schools restricting travel are being implemented by different countries to curb the spread of this virus hopefully we develop an effective vaccine and treatment as soon as possible continued clinical trials are required to understand the pathogenesis of covid-19 to tackle the disease better and to decrease morbidity and mortalitycoronaviruses covs are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface and belong to the family coronaviridae within the order nidovirales coronaviruses broadly infect vertebrates including humans birds bats snakes mice and other wild animals 12 since the mid-1960s seven known human coronaviruses hcovs have been identified 34 four commonly detected hcovs are 229e oc43 nl63 and hku1 in one study 229e and oc43 accounted for approximately 1529 of respiratory pathogens with relatively low virulence in humans 35 another epidemiological study in adults estimates that coronavirus causes about 15 of common colds 6 other significant causes of upper respiratory infections include influenza virus rhinovirus parainfluenza virus group a streptococci ebv and respiratory syncytial virus rsvthe three other strains of hcovs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 have a different pathogenicity and lead to higher mortality rates in human populations mers-cov was isolated from a male patient who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure in saudi arabia in 2012 7 and was subsequently responsible for 2494 cases and 858 deaths from 27 different countries case-fatality rate 344 8 both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 were first recognized in china sars-cov caused a total of 8422 probable sars cases 919 sars-related deaths case-fatality rate 11 and spread to 32 different countries or regions between november 2002 and august 2003 9 since december 2019 the sars-cov-2 has infected 73230 people and caused 1871 deaths case-fatality rate 26 and has spread to 25 countries according to the state council information office in beijing china updated as of feb 17 2020 10 as of this date the number of confirmed and suspected cases is still increasing as is the number of deaths although there is a significant increase in the number of recovered patients as wellcoronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s it is not known for how long they have existed most of the time they are associated with mild disease but every few years a highly virulent strain appears the pathogenesis of these deadly epidemics is unclear an examination of the structure of the viruses and the mechanism of infection may help elucidate and provide information for the development of effective treatment and possibly vaccines our purpose of this review is to provide a brief summary of the epidemiology and history of sars as well as the lessons learned the other aim is to review the epidemiology pathogenesis clinical characteristics diagnosis and management of patients infected with sars-cov-2 to better understand this deadly coronavirus and suggest prevention treatment and management strategiescovs are enveloped with a non-segmented positive-sense single-strand rna with size ranging from 26000 to 37000 bases this is the largest known genome among rna viruses 11 the genomic structure of covs is as follows 5-leader-utr-replicase-s spikee envelope-m membrane-n nucleocapsid-3utrpoly a tail there are accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3 end of genome 12 some of which have been shown to play an important roles in viral pathogenesis 13 the s protein is responsible for receptor-binding and subsequent viral entry into host cells the m and e proteins play important roles in viral assembly and the n protein is necessary for rna synthesis 1214covs can transmit across species barriers sars-cov originated from bats of the hipposideridae family using palm civets as intermediary hosts before dissemination to humans 1516 the earliest patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan ultimately caused the epidemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-2019 some of these patients had a history of contact with a wholesale seafood market in the early stages suggesting animal-to-person spread subsequently a large number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to the markets suggesting the development of person-to-person spread 17 18 19 20there are three primary ways to transmit the virus including close person-to-person contact aerosol transmission and transmission by touch 21 22 23 the virus is thought to be transmitted to other people by respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing droplet spread can occur when an infected person sneezes or coughs whereupon virus containing droplets are propelled up to 3 feet through the air and are deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth nose or eyes of persons who are nearby a recent report suggests that transmission through the ocular surface is also possible 24 the other avenues for the spread of the virus are shaking hands with an infected person touching an infected objectsurface frequent touching of the nose or mouth or coming into contact with a patients excreta another avenue is through hidden transmission 19 in which asymptomatic infected individuals or carriers unknowingly transmit the virus to unsuspecting contactsbefore the first outbreak of sars a limited number of hcovs such as hcov-229e were frequently found to infect humans and were widely circulating in human populations causing only mild illnesses like the common cold 325 however sars mers and sars-cov-2 present with a spectrum of disease severity ranging from flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome 2526 early on these patients are usually treated with conventional medications which had no clinical benefit resulting in spread to health care personnel for those with flu-like symptoms or even more severe disease it would not be immediately evident that this is an atypical and virulent form of a coronavirus for comparison influenza has an estimated mortality rate of 00702 a high index of suspicion is helpful but not foolproofthe various covs of animal origin undergo evolution and genetic recombination thereby resulting in mutated covs that may be highly pathogenic and potentially be more deadly to humans 327 for sars-cov the mutation rate in the sars-cov genome was estimated to be 080238  103 nucleotide substitutions per site per year and the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 116330  103 and 167467  103 per site per year respectively which are similar to that of other rna viruses 28 the various covs of animal origin undergo evolution and genetic recombination either within the host species or upon jumping from one species to another such changes thus have the potential to lead to variants that have high pathogenic potential when transmitted to humans 29 30 31 recently two mutations of the s protein and n protein sars-cov-2 may explain its zoonotic transmission 32 genomic alignment of 54 sars-cov-2 genomes identified two hotspots of hypervariability at positions 8789 synonymous variant and 28151serleu change located in the polyprotein and orf8 genes respectively 33most patients who have died from the virus had other chronic medical conditions were elderly patients or were immunocompromised one study reported that 67 of sars patients had acute renal impairment and 846 had proteinuria 34 hematological abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia were frequently observed in sars 3536 complications encountered for sars-cov-2 include acute respiratory distress syndrome 291241 anemia 15 641 acute cardiac injury 12 541 and secondary infection 10 441 26 in a sars-cov-2 descriptive study 11 of 99 patients died of multiple organ failure and seven were older than 60 years 37to date there is no anti-viral therapeutics that specifically targets human coronaviruses so treatment is only supportive in vitro interferons ifns are only partially effective against coronaviruses 38 in vivo the effectiveness of ifns combined with ribavirin requires further evaluation 39 a variety of other agents including antiviral peptides and corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in vitro andor in animal models 4041 however clinical evidence does not support the use of corticosteroid treatment for sars-cov-2 lung injury 42 vaccines that have been developed are either not effective or in some cases have been reported to be involved in the selection of novel pathogenic covs via recombination of circulating strains 122240 vaccine development can be a challenge it is noteworthy that almost 20 years after sars there is still no vaccine for coronavirusit has been 17 years since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by the sars coronavirus sars-cov 43 this highly contagious atypical pneumonia first appeared in guangdong province china in november 2002 the initial cases were animal handlers in guangzhou city having close contact with wild game food it was suggested that civets could serve as an intermediate amplification host three months later the sars pandemic was rapidly and globally disseminated due to person-to-person transmission of the virus on the february 21 2003 a medical professor from foshan in guangdong province who was considered a super-spreader went to hong kong to visit his relatives during his stay in hong kong he transmitted the virus to 2 family members 4 health care workers hcws and 12 other nearby residents because of international travel and transmission to hcws these patients spread the sars-cov to hong kong and other countries including vietnam singapore and canada eventually 8422 people were infected in 32 countries and 919 11 died 9 in china 5328 cases were reported and 349 65 perished between november 16 2002 and june 3 2003 9at the beginning of the outbreaks in hong kong mainland china and other areas we were unfamiliar with the deadly sars-cov it took about 3 months to complete the sequencing of this coronavirus 44 the global success in the fight against sars was partly based on epidemiological and biological characteristics of the infectious agent sars-cov an understanding of transmission patterns and the ability to diagnose and confirm affected patients ultimately led to effective containment measures and a slowdown in the spread of the disease due to the lack of medications or a vaccine the options for early intervention were limited to public health measures 45the steps that led to the containment of sars can be illustrated by the events that occurred in beijing beijing experienced the largest outbreak of sars beginning on the march 5 2003 the outbreak peaked within 6 weeks on the april 25 2003 when 173 newly suspected sars cases were hospitalized daily 46 on the june 20 2003 the last batch of 18 sars patients recovered and were discharged from hospital signaling the end of the pandemic in beijing the prompt resolution of the outbreak in beijing was attributed to the rapid adoption of a series of effective control measures1thousands of local and military health workers were deployed for emergency management of the outbreak large quantities of emergency supplies including personal protective equipment ppe and medical apparat were sent to front-line medical sectors these people and materials were key to winning the war against sars2more than 100 fever clinics were set up in all secondary and tertiary hospitals in beijing people visiting the fever clinics had a physical examination including body temperature white blood cell count and chest radiograph fever clinics played an important role in screening and triage3all actively ill patients with sars were concentrated in designated hospital wards on the may 1 2003 a new 1000-bed sars hospital xiaotangshan hospital beijing was built and put into operation immediately the advantages of having such a facility was that it was more conducive to the centralized management of sars patients and at the same time it reduced transmission of the virus to healthy people4during the period of the sars outbreak more than 60000 hcws received medical training in the management of patients with sars infection control and the use of ppe5multiple measures were taken to reduce person-to-person transmission including isolation of patients with sars tracing and quarantine of close contacts transit site surveillance and closing poorly maintained facilities that could enhance spread of the virus6information dissemination was critical timely and accurate reporting of the status of the epidemic and scientific guidance on prevention and infection control played important roles in stabilizing people and overcoming the epidemic 45 46 47 48
early on there were clues suggesting the link between sars-cov and civets bred for food in china 51 strengthening the monitoring of these wild animal sources was an important factor in controlling emergence of these virus and their spread in humans some scholars advocated that the trading of wild animals in wet markets in southern china should be banned 52 in fact the chinese government had issued bans on rearing trading transporting and slaughtering wild animals for dietary purposes over 10 years ago 53 this however did not stop the practice of illegal trading of wild animalsthe nonspecific symptoms and signs of sars and the long incubation period accentuated the transmission to hcws and people in close communities 54 early identification of suspect cases is the key to inhibiting the spread of the virus rapid identification of the viral genome and the development of rapid diagnostic tests will facilitate the isolation of those who are confirmed as infected 50
aenvironmental hygiene in medical sectors and personal hygiene of health care workers should be maintained 5556bcontact tracing strict isolation of actively ill patients and quarantine of close contacts should be implemented early 54ctraining in the use of personal protective equipment protects the safety of hcws 57destablishing fever clinics setting up designated hospital wards and sars hospitals reduced human-to-human transmission 58eeducation of the public on communicable diseases and what measures to take on a personal basis to prevent spread
a number of studies have shown that clear and timely dissemination of information is essential in handling an outbreak 54 infection control is based on rapid information dissemination since sars in 2003 china has implemented legislation on the surveillance reporting and early warning system of infectious diseases requiring the regular release of information during public health emergencies there is a clearly defined procedure and schedule for reporting public health emergencies which requires designated medical centers to submit relevant information online if confirmed reports on sars and other infectious diseases can be submitted and received directly within two hours through the internet 53after sars development of a vaccine appeared to be the best approach to prevent future sars-cov epidemics however there were many obstacles in sars vaccine development firstly researchers did not have a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of sars-cov secondly animal models of sars-cov infection could not simulate human disease because of an incongruent pathogenesis thirdly in order to test the efficacy many people must be tested in areas where the virus is endemic once the sars epidemic ended human trials were not possible 59 although several candidate vaccines against sars-cov have been produced and tested at present unfortunately there is no fda approved vaccine against sarsa cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown etiology now known as sars-cov-2 pneumonia occurred in wuhan hubei province and were reported to health authorities on the december 29 2019 60 this outbreak was associated with a large seafood and animal market 61 further investigations are ongoing to determine the origin of the infection to date many reports have described possible original and intermediate hosts fig 1
 researchers found that the sars-cov-2 showed a higher sequence homology to bat-cov-ratg13 that was previously detected in rhinolophus affinis from yunnan province than bat-sl-covzc21 and bat-sl-covzc45 which suggested that the chinese chrysanthemum bat is the origin of sars-cov-2 more recently the pangolin was believed to be the likely intermediate host due to the fact that there appeared to be approximately 99 sequence homology between sars-co v-2 and the consensus sequence derived from 1000 metagenomic samples from the pangolin species 62currently person to person transmission from patients with pneumonia or even asymptomatic patients during the incubation period are the main conduits for the spread of the infection 63 respiratory droplets are the main route of transmission but the virus can also be transmitted through contact or through the fecal-oral route based on a study which demonstrated the presence of the virus in rectal swabs 64 fifteen health care workers in a wuhan hospital were infected while caring for patients with confirmed or suspected infection 6566 as of february 11 2020 a total of 1716 health care workers have become infected and 5 have died 03 67 a study of a family cluster reported that five members of a family of six traveled to wuhan and four were infected with the sars-cov-2 the family member who did not travel became infected with the virus after several days of contact with the four infected members 19li et al 65 showed that human-to-human transmission among close contacts has been occurring since the middle of december 2019 further dissemination has continued rapidly over the ensuing months the authors estimated that the reproduction number r0 for sars-cov-2 is 22 meaning that every infected person can infect a mean of 22 people in another study the reproduction number of the sars-cov-2 was 268 with an epidemic doubling time of 64 days 68 it is worth noting that a nucleic acid fragment of the sars-cov-2 was detected by guangzhou centers for disease control and prevention cdc on a doorknob touched by a confirmed patient 69 china daily reported that scientists have discovered that stool samples from patients infected with the sars-cov-2 have also tested positive for the virus 70 and that the virus was also detected in the loose stool of the first patient in the us infected with the virus 71 meaning the virus has the potential to be spread through contaminated fecal materialon the january 22 2020 a member of the national expert panel on pneumonia reported that he was infected by sars-cov-2 during an inspection in wuhan he had worn an n95 mask but did not wear eye protection several days before the onset of pneumonia he complained of redness of the eyes unprotected exposure of the eyes to sars-cov-2 in the wuhan fever clinic may have allowed the virus to enter his body 24the situation with sars-cov-2 is evolving rapidly according to the national health commission nhc of china update on february 17 2020 10 a total of 72436 cases were confirmed in the chinese mainland including 11741 severe cases and 1868 deaths a total of 12552 patients have recovered and have been discharged an additional total of 6242 suspected cases remain most patients 59989 cases have been in hubei province where the outbreak began including 10970 severe cases and 1789 deaths the hong kong and macao special administrative regions as well as taiwan reported 92 confirmed cases of the disease including 2 deaths and 9 patients who have recovered there are significantly more sars-cov-2 cases than sars cases during the 2003 outbreak the current spread of the epidemic in china is shown in fig 2 fig 3 fig 4
according to world health organization who sars-cov-2 situation report 72 additional cases have been identified in a growing number of other international locations including 25 countries outside china fig 5
 there are now three deaths that have been reported outside of china one in the philippines one in japan and one in france the who declared the sars-cov-2 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 30 2020 citing that human-to-human infections have been confirmed in multiple countries 73according to fang et al 74 fifteen cases of childhood infection had been identified as of january 30 2020 including 8 boys and 7 girls ranging in age from 8 months to 12 years of the 15 pediatric cases 13 had a clear history of family clustering in wuhan at present several confirmed pregnant women in wuhan have given birth during the illness on february 2 2020 wuhan local media reported that a confirmed pregnant woman gave birth to a newborn by cesarean section under strict level three protection but the newborns throat swab was positive for the nucleic acid virus test 75 however chen et al tested the sars-cov-2 in amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swab and breastmilk samples from six confirmed sars-cov-2 pregnant women and all samples tested negative for the virus which suggests that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop covid-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy 76 no cases of newborns or child deaths have been reported the nhc has called for close monitoring of outbreaks in children and pregnant women 77the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team of the chinese cdc reported the epidemiology characteristics of 44672 confirmed cases as of february 11 2020 among the confirmed 44672 cases 747 in hubei province 514 were male and 809 were mild or moderate cases the majority of the cases were between 30 and 69 years old 778 while 0-9 year-olds and 10-19 year-olds accounted for 09 and 12 respectively hypertension 128 diabetes 53 cardiovascular disease 42 were the most common underlying diseases a total of 1023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 23 and 81 of the deaths were over 60 years old the mortality rates of those aged 6069 7079 and over 80 years were 36 80 and 148 respectively the mortality rate of critical cases was 49 67based on this evidence the current sars-cov-2 is easily transmissible in humans even in children and pregnant women it should also be noted that most patients have a good prognosis the symptoms in children are relatively mild and only a minority are in critical condition the death cases involved mostly the elderly and those with a chronic underlying disease this fact however does not diminish the seriousness of the epidemicduring the early stages of the epidemic several hospitals including wuhan union hospital wuhan tongji hospital and peking union medical college hospital had created different diagnosis and treatment programs 3778 79 80 the who and the nhc of china have since then published guidelines for the diagnosis and clinical management of sars-cov-2 pneumonia 8182according to the guidelines published by the nhc and based on current epidemiological studies the incubation period is typically 37 days with a maximum of 14 days 82 common symptoms of covid-19 include fever fatigue and dry cough a few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion runny nose sore throat and diarrhea some patients only have a low fever mild fatigue and no pneumonia in severe cases the infection can cause pneumonia shortness of breath and breathing difficulties occurring more than one week after infection critical patients may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock metabolic acidosis coagulation dysfunction and even death it is worth noting that during the course of severe and critical patients there can be moderate to low-grade fever or even no obvious feverhuang et al provided first-hand data regarding covid-19 26 their study reported the clinical features of the first 41 patients admitted to the

hospitalization included ards arrhythmia and shock of the 138 hospitalized patients 47 recovered and have been discharged 36 patients were admitted to the icu and 6 patients have diedchang et al 84 reported 13 confirmed patients outside of wuhan including 2 children aged 2 years and 15 years twelve patients 92 had fever before hospitalization other symptoms included upper airway congestion 62 cough 46 myalgia 23 and headache 23 all the patients recoveredguan et al 85 reported 1099 confirmed patients from 552 hospitals in the whole of china as of january 29 2020 the most common symptoms including fever 879 and cough 677 whereas diarrhea 37 and vomiting 50 were rare they also pointed out that only 438 of the patients had fever on presentation but 879 developed fever after being hospitalized moreover compared with non-severe cases any underlying diseases were significantly more common in severe cases the most common complication was pneumonia 791 ards 34 and shock 10 of the 1099 patients 55 patients were admitted to the icu and 15 patients diedthere were therefore a total of 41 99 and 138 total 278 cases of sars-cov pneumonia admitted in the 3 regional hospitals closest to the huanan seafood market that resulted in 6 11 and 6 deaths 23 deaths or a case fatality rate of 082in the early stages of the disease the total number of leukocytes in peripheral blood is normal or decreased the lymphocyte count is decreased and some patients show increases in liver enzymes muscle enzymes and myoglobin the c-reactive protein crp and erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr are increased in most patients and procalcitonin is normal in severe cases d-dimer increases and peripheral blood lymphocytes decrease progressively coronavirus nucleic acid can be detected in the throat sputum lower respiratory tract secretions blood and toolin huangs study 26 the blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia and lymphopenia prothrombin time and d-dimer levels on admission were higher in icu patients compared with non-icu patients icu patients had higher plasma levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 g-scf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1 and tnf in chens study 37 all patients were tested for nine respiratory pathogens and nucleic acids of influenza viruses a and b as well as bacteria and fungi no other respiratory viruses were detected but 4 cases of fungal and 1 case of bacterial infection were found the absolute number of leukocytes was decreased in 9 patients and increased in 24 patients the absolute neutrophil count was increased in 38 patients and the absolute lymphocyte count was decreased in 35 patients forty-three patients had varying degrees of liver dysfunction seven patients had varying degrees of renal dysfunction and most patients had abnormal myocardial zymograms seventy-three patients were tested for c-reactive protein which was increased in 63 patients in guans study 821 362 and 337 of the patients had lymphopenia thrombocytopenia and leukopenia respectively compared with non-severe cases severe cases had more prominent laboratory abnormalities 85in huangs study 26 all 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computed tomography ct and 40 98 had bilateral involvement the icu patients on admission had bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation the non-icu patients had bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation subsequent chest ct images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity whereas the consolidation was resolved in chens study 37 imaging showed that 74 patients had bilateral pneumonia 14 patients had multiple mottled and ground-glass opacities and 1 patient had a pneumothorax in wangs study 83 imaging showed that 138 patients had bilateral patchy shadows or ground-glass opacity in guans study 840 of 1099 patients received chest ct on admission which showed that 764 had pneumonia but 239 of severe cases had no radiologic abnormality on initial presentation ground-glass opacity 500 and bilateral patchy shadow 460 were the most common findings 85the diagnostic criteria of suspected and confirmed cases were summarized in table 1
the sars-cov-2 needs to be distinguished from other known viral pneumonias including influenza virus parainfluenza virus adenovirus respiratory syncytial virus rhinovirus human metapneumovirus sars coronavirus mers coronavirus as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial pneumonias for patients with underlying diseases attention should be paid to the detection of invasive fungal infections the differential diagnosis also includes non-infectious diseases such as vasculitis dermatomyositis and organizing pneumonia it should be noted that often patients with viral pneumonia may test positive to multiple viruses and the potential lethality of a combined sars-cov-2influenza virus infection should not be ignoredseveral rapid and sensitive detection tests have been developed for the prevention and control of the sars-cov-2 outbreak at present seven products including the sars-cov-2 nucleic acid detection kit fluorescent pcr method and the sars-cov-2 nucleic acid sequencing system have been approved on an emergency basis by the national medical products administration biological product companies have expanded production of detection kits for the new coronavirus the use of detection kits can accelerate accurate diagnosis of patients help to determine quarantine and isolation requirements assist in determining the treatment of patients and save limited medical resources however the rapidity of spread of the disease has led to an insufficient supply of detection kitsit is worth noting that there have been confirmed patients whose viral nucleic acid tests are negative multiple times in the early stages and there have also been confirmed cases whose throat swabs were negative for the viral nucleic acid test but positive in alveolar lavage fluid correlation of chest ct and rt-pcr testing of 1014 cases showed that ct had a 88 had a positive ct scan but only 59 had positive rt-pcr 86 the poor sensitivity of the current tests makes diagnosis and epidemic control more challenging sampling techniques extraction and detection of viral nucleic acids and diagnostic reagents may affect the test results more attention should be paid to the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic reagents and diagnostic decisions should rely on comprehensive judgment based on the clinical manifestations laboratory results and imaging examinations of patients according to the latest guideline of the nhc 82 if the suspected cases in hubei province have imaging characteristic of pneumonia the ct image results can be used as a basis for clinical diagnosis casesthe rapid sequencing of the nearly 30000 nucleotide sars-cov-2 genome was accomplished in approximately 3 weeks from the time of the first hospitalized patient on the december 12 2019 by zhangs group and several others in china 91 the genomic structure is shown in fig 7
and shows greater than 999 consistency 1991 92 93 94 95the sars-cov-2 genome was found to possess 14 orfs encoding 27 proteins the orf1ab and orf1a genes are located at the 5-terminus of the genome and encode 15 non-structural proteins nsps from nsp1 to nsp10 and from nsp12 to nsp16 the 3-terminus of the genome contains 4 structural proteins s e m and n and 8 accessory proteins 3a 3b p6 7a 7b 8b 9b and orf14 at the amino acid level the sars-cov-2 is quite similar to that of sars-cov but there are some notable differences for example the 8a protein is present in sars-cov and absent in sars-cov-2 the 3b protein is 154 amino acids in sars-cov but shorter in sars-cov-2 with only 22 amino acids further studies are needed to characterize how these differences affect the functionality and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 95the phylogenetic tree based on whole genomes showed that sars-cov-2 is most closely related to bat sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzc21 ncbi accession number mg772934 and bat-sl-covzc45 ncbi accession number mg772933 which share 89 sequence homology 91 92 93 their genomic organization is typical of a lineage b beta coronavirus further phylogenetic analysis has posited that sars-cov-2 is a product of recombination with previously identified bat coronaviruses but a recent report has subsequently identified a bat covs sequence ratg13 with 9296 sequence identity with the novel virus demonstrating that ratg13 is the closest relative of the sars-cov-2 and forms a distinct lineage from other sars-covs this rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recombination event 9496 even though there are high similarities between sars-cov-2 s and ratg13 s there are two distinct differences one is an rrar furin recognition site formed by an insertion residues in the s1s2 protease cleavage site in sars-cov-2 rather than the single arginine in sars-cov 97 98 99 100 101 the other difference is the presence of 29 variant residues between sars-cov-2 s and ratg13 s 17 of which mapped to the receptor binding domain rbd 97the identities of 5- and 3-utr sequences are more than 836 consistent between sars-cov-2 and other -covs such as sars-cov 102 the replicase polyproteins ppla and pp1ab encoded by the largest genes orf1ab are proteolytic and have been reported to function in the replication of covs by regulatory elements located within the non-structural proteins 102 four structural proteins s e m and n contribute to virion assembly and infection of covs the spike protein located on the surface of viral particles is made up of homotrimers of s proteins and is the key for the viral attachment to host receptors 103104spike glycoprotein consists of s1 and s2 subunits the s1 subunit contains a signal peptide an n-terminal domain ntd and rbd while the s2 subunit includes the conserved fusion peptide fp heptad repeat 1 and 2 hr1 and hr2 transmembrane domain tm and cytoplasmic domain cp 102105 furthermore the s2 subunit of sars-cov-2 is highly conserved and shares 99 similarity with those of bat-sl-covzc45 bat-sl-covzc21 and human sars-cov 102 the s2 subunit is therefore targeted when screening broad spectrum antiviral peptides which is an important piece of information that can be used to develop preventive and treatment measures most recently the 3d structure of s protein was elucidated using cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em and the rbd structure of the s protein is closer to the central location of sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov 97the e protein plays a role in virus assembly and release and is required for pathogenesis 106107 the n protein contains two domains both of which can bind virus rna genomes via different mechanisms it has been reported that the n protein can bind nsp3 protein to help tether the genome to replicase-transcriptase complex rtc and package the encapsulated genome into virions 12108109 the n protein is also an antagonist of interferon and viral encoded repressor vsr of rna interference rnai which benefits viral replication 110cell entry is an essential component of cross-species transmission especially for the -covs all covs encode a surface glycoprotein spike which binds to the host receptor and mediates viral entry 111 for -covs the rbd of the spike protein mediates the interaction with host receptor upon binding the receptor the spike protein is cleaved by nearby host proteases and releases the signal peptide to facilitate virus entry into host cells 112 113 114 115angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 are known host receptors for the -covs sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 116117 in similar fashion to sars-cov sars-cov-2 also uses ace2 to gain entry into host cells hoffmann et al found that the cellular protease mprss2 blocks entry by cleaving the spike protein and may constitute a treatment option 118 zhou et al also confirmed that sars-cov-2 is able to use all but mouse ace2 as an entry receptor for ace2-expressing cells but not cells without ace2 indicating that the cell receptor for sars-cov-2 could be ace2 and not other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase n and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 94 huang also showed that the affinity of the sars-cov-2 s-rbd binding to ace2 is less than that of sars-cov through monte carlo algorithm 119 however wrapp et al found that sars-cov-2 s binding to ace2 has approximately 10- to 20- fold higher affinity than sars-cov s which can provide one explanation why sars-cov-2 has more human-to human spread compared to sars-cov 97the combination of sars-cov-2 s and ace2 of host cells is similar to the combination of sars-cov and ace2 indicating that they have the same mechanism to entry into host cells 97 the s protein of metastable prefusion conformation undergoes a series of structural rearrangements to combine with the viral membrane of host cells 111120 this process consists of the s1 subunit binding to the host cell receptor triggering of the prefusion trimers instability and shedding of the s1 subunit resulting in a highly stable post-fusion conformation of the s2 subunit 121 during the binding of the subunit s1 to its cognate receptor it is important to note that the s1 subunit exists in 2 different states a down conformation and an up conformation state which corresponds to a receptor-inaccessible state and an unstable receptor-accessible state respectively 122 123 124 125 unfortunately there are significant conformational differences between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 such that the commercially available monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov do not react with sars-cov-2 97sars-cov-2 may directly bind to ace2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes via specific expression of ace2 in healthy liver tissues using cell rna-seq data of two independent cohorts 126 though the respiratory systems is a primary target of sars-cov-2 bioinformatic analysis of single-cell transcriptomes datasets of lung esophagus gastric ileum and colon reveal that the digestive system is also a potential route of entry for covid-19 as ace2 was not only highly expressed in lung at2 cells esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon 127in response to the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the sars-cov-2 china has activated level i public health emergency response for the entire country this activates the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures for health and safety a team of professionals from the nhc and china cdc was sent to conduct field investigations and implement disease control and prevention measures the virus was quickly isolated and sequenced on january 3 2020 the first complete genome of the sars-cov-2 was determined and shared internationally which led to the rapid development and deployment of diagnostic tests 60 the nhc announced that preventive and control measures of category a infectious diseases would be implemented to effectively fight sars-cov-2 and has also introduced public education campaigns at the same time all medical expenses of confirmed patients would be covered by central and local financial institutionsquarantine is a traditional but very effective measure to counter a deadly epidemic but quarantine protocols can be hard to enforce the local government in wuhan announced the suspension of public transportation with closure of airports railway stations and highways in the city to prevent further disease transmission on january 23 2020 subsequently the chinese government imposed travel bans on several chinese cities near wuhan at the same time the chinese government extended the lunar new year holidays and postponed the reopening of schools and factories to keep the nationwide migration of the population to a minimum travelers from wuhan and other epidemic areas were advised to report their travel history and to self-quarantine for two weeks to prevent community transmission in addition most local governments required that all passengers must wear medical surgical masks or n95 masks when accessing public places taxis or subways temperature screening checkpoints have been set up at subway stations railway stations high-speed rail exits and airports to screen passengers in an effort to curb the spread of the novel coronaviruswith the rapid spread of the epidemic more designated treatment hospitals and health care workers were needed to meet the growing number of patients on january 24 2020 the local government in wuhan announced the construction of a 1000-bed infirmary named huoshenshan hospital and a 1500-bed infirmary named leishenshan hospital within 10 days to ease the shortage of beds and treat people diagnosed with the sars-cov-2 these facilities are specialty hospitals for infectious diseases rather than simply units to receive and quarantine patients wuhan has also been building 11 mobile fangcang hospitals a chinese name which came from noahs ark and creating tens of thousands of beds to centralize quarantine and provide medical treatment for confirmed patients with mild symptoms suspected patients and those who need observation the new facilities further enhance the local public health capacities hospitals offer online consultants and medical services to symptomatic patients and suspected patients which help reduce the frequency that patients go to hospitals and thereby reduce the risk of being infected health care workers including military medical teams from across the chinese mainland arrived in hubei to provide much needed assistance at present more than 30000 health care workers have arrived in hubei to help fight the novel coronavirus epidemic in order to prevent health care workers from being infected the nhc ensured enough supplies of isolation gowns gloves and masks and issued a technical guideline for the prevention and control of infection caused by the novel coronavirus 128the nhc also formulated a community prevention and control program for sars-cov-2 pneumonia to strengthen community-level epidemic prevention measures to control the spread of the outbreak 129 all communities screen patients with fever within the community and monitor and report suspected cases with covid-19 various forms of health education have been carried out in the community to disseminate knowledge of epidemic prevention and control such as using masks and washing hands correctly the nhc issued guidelines for the protection of people at different levels of risk for covid-19 130there is no clear unified and effective treatment plan for covid-19 most guidelines emphasize early identification early isolation early diagnosis and early treatment the treatment and management of sars-cov-2 pneumonia mainly include the following aspects fig 8
 3778 79 80 81 82suspected and confirmed cases should be isolated and treated in designated hospitals with effective isolation and protective conditions as soon as possible suspected cases should be isolated in a single room who suggests that patients with mild symptoms and without underlying chronic diseases such as lung or heart disease renal failure or immunodeficiency may be cared for in the home environment in isolation 131 however severe cases should be hospitalized and critical cases should be admitted to the icu as soon as possiblesupportive therapy includes bedrest adequate nutrition monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation prevention of dehydration and maintaining water electrolyte and acid-base balance for severe cases it may be necessary to proactively prevent complications and secondary infections treat underlying diseases and provide organ function support according to the patients condition such as that reported by chen et all that involved the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy to 27 of such patients 37supplemental oxygen should be administered to patients with decreased oxygen saturation in huangs study 26 four 10 patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation and two received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo in chens study 37 75 of 99 patients received oxygen therapy 13 patients required non-invasive mechanical ventilation four patients needed an invasive ventilator to assist ventilation and three patients were treated with ecmo in wangs study 83 of the 36 patients in the icu four patients received high-flow oxygen therapy 15 patients received non-invasive ventilation and 17 patients received invasive ventilation four patients switched to ecmo in guans study 418 of 1099 patients received oxygen therapy 67 patients received mechanical ventilation and ecmo was adopted in 5 severe cases 85due to lack of valid evidence and possible adverse effects routine use of corticosteroid should be avoided unless for specific reasons baillie jk et al 42 suggested that corticosteroid should not be used for the treatment of sars-cov-2-induced lung injury or shock because of the lack of evidence that patients with covid-19 will benefit from corticosteroid in the first 41 patients only 22 941 patients were given corticosteroid with six of these in the icu 26 chen et al reported that 19 1999 patients received corticosteroid treatment for 315 days 37 in wangs study 83 45 62138 patients received corticosteroid treatment in guans study 186 2041099 of patients were given systemic corticosteroids 85indiscriminate or inappropriate antimicrobial treatment especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be avoided however in huangs study 26 all his 41 patients received antibiotic therapy in chens study 37 70 patients were given antibiotic treatment among whom 25 patients were treated with a single antibiotic and 45 patients were given combination therapy the duration of antibiotic treatment was 317 days in addition there were 15 patients who received antifungal treatment in wangs study 83 the 138 hospitalized patients all received antibacterial therapy including moxifloxacin 644 ceftriaxone 246 azithromycin 181 in guans study 632 patients were given intravenous antibiotics and 30 patients were given antifungal medications 85at present there is no evidence-based medicine to support the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for covid-19 the previous experience of treating sars-cov mers-cov or influenza infections guides the selection of antiviral agents for covid-19 the current guideline of the nhc recommends ifn- lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin as antiviral therapy in huangs study 26 38 of 41 patients were given antiviral therapy the jinyintan hospital has launched a randomized controlled trial of the anti-hiv drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in chens study 37 75 patients received antiviral treatment including oseltamivir ganciclovir and lopinavirritonavir and the duration of antiviral treatment was 314 days in wangs study 83 there were 899 124138 patients who received oseltamivir and in guans study 358 3931099 of patients received oseltamivir 85 the anti-viral drug remdesivir gilead is in clinical trials to treat covid-19 in wuhan 132 chloroquine phosphate has also been shown to be effective in some patientsidentifying or developing novel drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the sars-cov-2 outbreak based on the structural information of clinical effective medicines for sars-cov-2 liu et al predicted 10 commercial medicines which may function as inhibitors of sars-cov-2 including colistin valrubicin icatibant bepotastine epirubicin etc some of these may be more resistant to viral mutation than lopinavirritonavir 133 stebbing et al suggested that baricitinib may reduce both the viral entry and inflammation 134lu reported that remdesivir may have the greatest potential for the successful treatment of sars-cov-2 but the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in covid-19 needs further evaluation 135 the antiviral efficiency of five fad-approved drugs and two well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been studied and it has been found that remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro 136 the new england journal of medicine reported that the first case of covid-19 confirmed in the united states was treated with intravenous remdesivir and demonstrated clinical improvement 71 at present a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase iii clinical trial of remdesivir has been launched and already 761 confirmed cases have been enrolled 132 lu also pointed out that there is no direct evidence that oseltamivir is effective in the treatment of sars-cov-2 135 however we found that oral oseltamivir or abidol has been used for suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 casesfavilavir formerly known as fapilavir was the first anti-novel coronavirus drug that has been approved for marketing by the national medical products administration since the outbreak the drug was developed by zhejiang hisun pharmaceutical company and is expected to play an important role in preventing and treating the epidemic 137the role of intestinal microecological regulators that can be used to maintain intestinal microecological balance and prevent secondary bacterial infections is unclear chinese traditional medicine suggests shufengjiedu and lianhuaqingwen which have played a role in the prevention and treatment of new infectious respiratory diseases may be of benefit 138139anxiety and fear often exist in suspected or confirmed patients emergency psychological crisis intervention 140 and the implementation of classified intervention for different groups of people is helpful in order to strengthen psychological counseling and reduce the psychological damage caused by the epidemic mass hysteria has also led to incidences of racial discrimination against asians particularly in non-asian countriesresearch institutions and pharmaceutical companies worldwide are stepping up research and development for a coronavirus vaccine virus strains have been isolated from patients samples and provide the basis for research and development of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus although vaccines have been developed for sars-cov and mers-cov these are not commercially available 1214141 since the emergence of sars-cov and mers-cov basic research on coronaviruses and advances in vaccine preparation technology can significantly shorten the development time of new coronavirus vaccines however the difficulties and challenges of developing an effective vaccine have been discussed earlier and the key to a successful vaccine program is to vaccinate people before an outbreak occurs not begin to develop the vaccine during the outbreak development of animal models that faithfully mimic sars-cov-2 infection in humans is critical not only in providing a more refined understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved but also to serve as a screening model for potential chemotherapeutic agents and vaccinesrecommendations for the prevention and management of coronavirus epidemics are summarized in fig 9
 since both sars and sars-cov-2 appear to have an exotic animal origin the purchase trafficking and sale of wild animals should be banned and illegal activities should be prosecuted early recognition of the problem early identification of infected patients and early mobilization of healthcare resources are critical in limiting morbidity and mortality when an outbreak occurs it is very important to rapidly identify and characterize the pathogen in order to be able to develop diagnostic assays in the early stage of the disease epidemic summarizing the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy formulating the diagnosis procedures defining suspected cases and locations determining transmission patterns isolating contagious patients and formulating the appropriate quarantine strategy are all necessary and need to be implemented promptlythe strict control of cross-infection in medical institutions is also key to preventing the further spread of the epidemic in addition actively mobilizing the population to participate in epidemic prevention and control is critical and this can be achieved by accurate information dissemination and ongoing updates real-time updating the information of the epidemic situation can help to alleviate panic and reduce societal anxiety a strong public health surveillance system to guide the response to the outbreak is important in the face of a lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks last but not least use of the internet and the media to conduct health education for the people publicize the correct knowledge of prevention and offer online consultation to guide patients to seek medical treatment correctly are additional strategies that can be implemented to achieve viral containmentalthough sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have certain similarities in biological epidemiological and pathological characteristics there are some important differences first the most fundamental difference between the two viruses lies in their gene sequence second during the sars epidemic a total of 8422 patients worldwide were infected with sars-cov of whom 919 died with a mortality rate of 95 9 a total of 5328 patients in china were infected with sars-cov of whom 349 died with a mortality rate of 65 9 as of february 17 2020 there were 72436 confirmed cases of 2019-ncov in china of whom 1868 have died with a mortality rate of 26 10 compared to sars there are more confirmed cases suspected cases and deaths of sars-cov-2 but the mortality rate is lower than that of sarsfrom 2017 to 2018 influenza ravaged the world affecting up to 45 million people and killing about 95000 people with a reported mortality rate of about 02 every year millions of people are infected by influenza despite the existence of a yearly vaccine according to the united states cdc weekly report the number of childhood deaths in the united states so far from influenza during this flu season alone is 105 compared with influenza the number of patients who have died of coronavirus infection is less but the virulence and mortality rate of coronavirus is significantly higherclinically the patients with covid-19 have no upper respiratory symptoms such as runny nose sneezing sore throat in 2003 a large number of medical personnel were infected and iatrogenic transmission occurred in sars in contrast although there are cases of nosocomial infection in sars-cov-2 most of them are out-of-hospital infectionsthe sars-cov-2 epidemic of 2020 in china is an international crisis affecting human lives the global economy societal views and lifestyle during times of crisis misinformation blame and conspiracy theories abound it is probably prudent to not entirely trust the media whether local regional or international as each most likely has their own agenda on the other hand it is the responsibility of doctors and scientists to evaluate the events to ascertain whether or not more effective management of the crisis could have been attained this comes with its own set of challenges as hindsight is always 2020the quarantining of an entire country has been extreme astounding and unprecedented this not only involves quarantining measures within china but also internationally as countries canceled flights into china quarantined their own nationals as they returned from china and installed thermal scanners to detect ill people but the quarantine measures inside china are certainly eye-opening the entire city of wuhan was shut off and this was extended to every other city in china in effect the entire country was told to stay home creating an enormous impact on the economy and on peoples daily lives roads and stores became deserted fig 10
 in ningbo each household was only permitted to send one person out for groceries every other day schools were closed till the end of march everyone wears masks the objective was to starve the virus to eliminate hosts yet even with these measures new cases continued to appear the quarantine measures in china have obviously come under a great deal of scrutiny with so called experts weighing in some saying that it will not work that isolating a city deprives it of medical resources whatever the criticism it is humbling to think of what may have happened without these draconian measures it is also difficult to comprehend if such measures could actually take place in other parts of the world or if the implementation of these changes could have taken place as quickly for example hand shaking is not part of chinese culture but it is almost automatic in other parts of the world and it is normally done without even thinking this is the first thing that would have to stop to help contain the virusthen there is the matter of the ophthalmologist and others who voiced concerns in the media about a cluster of cases of a flu-like illness near the end of december at the present time it is difficult to say whether or not the response could have been faster than it actually was as this corresponds to the time when work began on viral sequencing it is possible that medical teams were already working on the sequence at that time it is also quite possible that officials did not initially sound the alarm publicly because they did not want to cause a panic perhaps this was the wrong decision but these decisions are difficult in times of crisis and it is of course easy to second guess it is easy to understand that this can be perceived as withholding information and why the public would be frustrated the lesson here is that dissemination of accurate and validated information and establishing guidelines to prevent the spread of infections is criticalthere are many heroes in these crises people who have risked their lives and made incredible sacrifices to help society rid itself of this scourge including those who work on the front lines epidemiologists scientists doctors first responders and members of the public unfortunately these events also bring out the worst in people numerous accounts of racial discrimination have been perpetrated against asians across the world many rising to the level of hate crimes one must not forget the psychological impact of an infection such as this on people who are not even infected or who will never encounter an infected personthe emergence of sars-cov mers-cov and now sars-cov-2 suggests that coronavirus will pose a lasting threat to human beings the epidemic will eventually be contained and peoples memory of the coronavirus may gradually blur but we must not forget the lessons learned from this crisis and already begin to take measures to prevent the next new outbreak of coronavirus or some other virus from appearing in the future if it does appear how will we respond to it what if it does not happen in china will other countries have the fortitude to implement even more drastic measures and mobilize resources to prevent the spread of the virus and to care for the sickwe can always improve on the handling of global pandemics or epidemics from the lessons learned during the sars and now the sars-cov-2 epidemics we can nearly provide a roadmap for the response to future outbreaks the development of a vaccine for coronavirus is a critical step in prevention but it may not be effective for future strains and we must be ready for the next epidemic

reported in the late december of 2019 and has not been previously identified in human the novel coronavirus isolated by researchers afterward was named as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov2coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses and two strains of themsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-covare zoonotic in origin and known to cause fatal respiratory diseases as 2019-ncov due to wide distribution and genomes recombination of coronaviruses 2019-ncov is the successive but novel coronavirus and shown to have a higher rate of infection35 early diagnosis of coronavirus and effective prevention of transmission are core tasks in control of 2019-ncov epidemicwho has claimed that 2019-ncov spreads primarily through saliva droplets or discharge from the nose httpswwwwhointhealth-topicscoronavirustabtab1 saliva is secreted 90 from major salivary glands and 10 from minor salivary glands within ph from 6 to 767 whole saliva is a bio-mixture which physiologically contains crevicular fluid desquamated oral epithelial cells and microorganisms and may contain blood respiratory secretions gastric acid from reflux and food debris in pathological occasions8 around 99 of saliva is water and the rest 1 contains a large group of components for the purpose of digesting taste buffering balance of remineralization and anti-microorganisms9 oral cavity is an entrance and an outlet of body and saliva is supposed to play a role in early diagnosis and close contact transmission in infectious diseases here we summarize the reports associated with saliva and 2019-ncova study from to et al showed that deep throat saliva has high diagnosis rate of 2019-ncov11 twelve positive patients were confirmed based on epidemiological history clinical criteria and laboratory detection of 2019-ncov in nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens and saliva were collected by coughing out a few days after hospitalization11 using real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction by testing the s gene of 2019-ncov 11 saliva specimens were positive for 2019-ncov out of 12 patients 916711 those 33 patients who are negative for laboratory test of 2019-ncov were all negative in saliva examination in addition six patients offer serial saliva and five out of them showed a declining trend of virus as hospitalization is going on11 live virus was detected in three patients of the above six patients by viral culture11another study from the same group used self-collected saliva from deep throat by covid-19 patients tested 2019-ncov rna and analyzed temporal profile of 2019-ncov load12 from this study saliva mixed with nasopharyngeal and bronchopulmonary secretions from deep throat was collected by coughing out in the morning12 among 23 covid-19 patients included for this study 20 cases of their saliva showed detectable 2019-ncov rna12 in the temporal profile of viral load saliva reached the peak of viral load during the first week of symptom onset and then declined12this group also detected 2019-ncov rna of saliva after treatment12 even if using antibodies against 2019-ncov viral rna could still be detected for 20 days or even longer in deep throat saliva specimens of one third of included patients suggesting the viral rna could stay a long period of time instead of dying out after antibody application12 one patient with complete symptom resolved was found 2019-ncov rna positive again after 2 days of negative results suggesting that low levels of 2019-ncov rna could still be excreted in saliva even after clinical recovery12 more precisely whether 2019-ncov rna detected in saliva after complete symptom resolved means infectious or shedding virus needs further studies to confirmoral swabs are probably applicable in early detection13 by harvesting oral swabs and testing rna among 15 covid-19 patients zhang et al found that half of them 50 were 2019-ncov rna positive in oral swabs four 267 had positive anal swabs six 40 had positive blood test and three 20 were serum positive13 dynamic viral rna presence in saliva compared with anal swabs were analyzed among 16 patients among all swab positive together most of the positive result was from oral swabs at early stage while more positive came from anal swabs at late stage of covid-19 suggesting that oral swabs may indicate early infection of 2019-ncov but cannot be used as a discharge criteria13to rule out contamination of respiratory secretion chen et al collected saliva directly from the opening of salivary gland and found 2019-ncov nucleic acid suggesting that salivary glands were 2019-ncov infected14 thirteen cases who were nucleic acid positive by oropharyngeal swab among 31 covid-19 patients were included and four of them 1290 were positive in saliva14 three cases of these four were critically ill patents in need of ventilator support suggesting 2019-ncov nucleic acid positive in salivary-gland-originated saliva as an indicator of severity of covid-1914xu et al analyzed public bulk rna-seq from paracarcinoma normal tissues and found expression of ace2 in oral buccal and gingiva tissue29 this group also analyzed data of single-cell rna-seq from patients oral tissue and found that ace2 were highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue and also in epithelial cells t cells b cells and fibroblasts of oral mucosa29saliva is generated in salivary glands and flow through ducts into oral cavity liu et al analyzed rhesus macaques and found ace2 were also expressed in epithelial cells lining on minor salivary gland ducts30 which could be found in sinonasal cavity oral cavity pharynx larynx trachea and lungs amounting to 8001000 individuals in total and contributing nearly 1 of saliva a day31 this group also set up animal models by inoculating functional pseudovirus intranasally and found that ace2 epithelial cells of minor salivary gland ducts are targeted host cells as early as 48 h after infection30besides above evidence from animal study chen et al analyzed data from gtex hpa fantom5 and consensus datasets and revealed the expression of ace2 receptor in human granular cells in salivary glands14 ace2 cell in salivary glands could possibly be the target cells of 2019-ncov and generate infectious saliva in sustained way theoreticallyfurin has been implicated in virus infection by cleaving viral envelope glycoproteins and enhancing infection with host cells32 a furin-like cleavage site in the spike protein of 2019-ncov has been identified3334 furin is highly expressed in lung tissue possibly providing a gain-of-function to infectivity of 2019-ncov333536 furin expression was detected by immunostaining in human tongue epithelia and significantly upregulated when squamous cell carcinoma scc occured37 combined with high expression of ace2 tongue has high risk of coronavirus infection among oral cavity and ssc even increases the risk once exposed to coronavirus while it suggests that cells expressing furin have lower restriction for virus entry theoretically it should still be cautious whether the furin-like cleavage site plays a big role in 2019-ncov infection36whether droplets can travel long and far along air flow is largely determined by their size39 most communicable respiratory infections are transmitted via large droplets within short distance or by contacting contaminated surfaces4041 large droplets diameter  60 m tend to quickly settle form the air so the risk of pathogen transmission is limited to individuals in close proximity to the saliva droplet source39 small droplets diameter  60 m may get involved in short-range transmission distance between individuals less than 1 m small droplets are likely to evaporate into droplet nuclei diameter  10 m in favorable environment then become potential for long-distance aerosol transmission42saliva droplets are generated when breathing talking coughing or sneezing and formed as particles in a mixture of moisture and droplet nuclei of microorganisms43 the amount distance and size of saliva droplets varies among people suggesting the infectious strength and transmission path of saliva droplets differ when same pathogen was contracted44 three thousand saliva droplet nuclei could be generated by one cough which nearly equals to the amount produced during a 5-min talk43 around 40000 saliva droplets reaching several meters in air can be generated by one sneeze4345 one normal exhalation can generate saliva droplets reaching the distance of 1 m in air43 large saliva droplets with more mass tends to fall ballistically to the ground and small saliva droplets travel like a cloud over longer distance by air flow394345aerosols are suspension of particles in air liquid or solid within size from 0001 to above 100 m39 infectious aerosols contain pathogens39 long-distance aerosol transmission is determined by sufficiently small infectious droplets being almost indefinitely airborne and transmitted at a long distance distance between individuals more than 1 m39 aerosol transmission is well accepted in infection of tuberculosis measles and chickenpox and other infectious agents may behave as airborne transmission in a favorable environment or opportunistically such as sars-cov influenza virus and adenovirus4046 opportunistically airborne transmission is a mode that infectious agents not only have transmission routines by contacting and droplets but also can reach distant susceptible hosts under restricted conditions by fine-particle aerosols in favorable environments40 it is possible when aerosol-generating procedure is implemented such as dental practice that 2019-ncov could possibly spread in airborne transmission3847whether saliva droplets can become truly long-distance aerosol transmission is determined by how long the saliva droplets can reside in the air physical decay how long the pathogen in saliva droplets remain infectious biological decay and whether theses infectious saliva droplets can be acquired by another person acquisition40 in terms of physical decay saliva droplets evaporate fast into reduced mass in dry air tending to stay longer along with air flow39 the composition of droplet nuclei determines its terminal size39 for droplets with slow biological decay temperature differences and opened door set up droplets exchange along with air flow48 biological decay is determined by dehydration exposure to ultraviolet and chemicals39 only hardy organism such as m tuberculosis can survive long in air to form long-distance transmission49 a recent review summarized that coronavirus stay vital on surfaces of metal glass or plastic for up to 9 days but no solid evidence has been found how long in air50 the coronavirus on inanimate surfaces could be efficiently inactivated by 01 sodium hypochlorite 6271 ethanol or 05 hydrogen peroxide within 1 min as summarized in the literature50so far no solid evidence to consistently support that 2019-ncov in saliva droplets can keep vital along air flow for very long time liu et al collected 35 aerosol samples from three areas in two hospitals of wuhan and tested 2019-ncov rna by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction51 they found that patient area had low or even undetectable aerosol 2019-ncov rna but deposition aerosol were tested positive suggesting that not much vital virus in air flow but tend to deposit to the floor which is similar to movements of large saliva droplets as noted previously51 in medical staff area airborne 2019-ncov rna concentration was decreased after patients reduced and sanitization rigorously implemented51 in public area accumulation of crowds increased airborne 2019-ncov rna concentration from undateable level51for acquisition of infectious saliva droplets by a susceptible host infectious saliva droplets could land in month eyes or be inhaled into lungs directly2652 a case report shows that 2019-ncov infection occurred in a fever clinic when a susceptible person wore an n95 mask covering mouth and nose without eyes protected suggesting a transmission to eyes53 it is also reported that sars-cov is predominantly transmitted by contacting eye mouth or nose54 respiratory virus could lead to respiratory infections of another person through inducing ocular complications55 exposed mucous membranes increased risk of virus transmission by a sars-cov study and close exposure to an infected person increases the chance of infection55 a previous study confirmed that infection of sars-cov was reduced to a certain degree by wearing surgical masks of susceptible healthcare workers562019-ncov which is also named as sars-cov-257 shares about 79 nucleotide sequence similarity with sars-cov5175861 sars-cov have a higher mortality rate while 2019-ncov spreads much faster12 the similarities and differences of saliva are summarized as follows in terms of diagnosis value of saliva direct invasion to oral tissues and saliva droplet transmission between sars-cov and 2019-ncov hopefully explaining the faster transmission speed of 2019-ncov table 1for the diagnostic value of saliva in coronavirus infection high expression level of sars-cov rna was detected in saliva specimens from 17 sars patients four of which had not yet lung lesion suggesting value of early diagnosis of saliva similarly to 2019-ncov62 a previous animal study on early events of sars-cov infection showed that sars-cov was detected in oral swabs before blood test turned positive on second day after viral challenge through nasal cavity3063 the viral load profile in saliva of 2019-ncov nearly peaks at the time of symptom onset while sars-cov peaks at around 10 days after symptoms6467 the high viral load of 2019-ncov suggests it can be transmitted even if symptom is mild or less obvious older age was associated with higher sars-cov in saliva and a high initial sars-cov load was associated with death6869 2019-ncov rna could be detected in saliva for 20 days or even longer and the prolonged detection of viral rna also exist in sars-cov and mers-cov infection6467despite 2019-ncov and sars-cov share ace2 receptor on host cells which are found in salivary gland and tongue tissues23252953 2019-ncov is likely more infectious than sars-cov possibly due to lower rbd-ace2 binding free energy and more flexible rbd of 2019-ncov than that of sars-cov70 compared with sars-cov a furin-like cleavage site is peculiar in the s protein of 2019-ncov which could theoretically be cleaved by furin expressed in tongue tissues3334for saliva droplets as transmission routine in coronavirus infection a retrospective cohort study of sars-cov transmission reported that students who were in the same cubicle with the sars patient contracted sars-cov telling us that proximity to sars patients increases chances of sars-cov infection52 virus-laden droplets were found in a study as a routine of transmission in sars epidemics7172 van doremalen et al evaluated the stability of 2019-ncov and sars-cov in aerosils using a bayesian regression model and found that 2019-ncov remained viable ins aerosols throughout 3-h experiment duration which is similar to sars-cov73 sars-cov dissemination belongs to opportunistically airborne transmission4074 2019-ncov also possibly belong to the same transmission type dissemination of virus occurs if individuals are exposed to a high concentration of infectious aerosols in comparatively sealed space for long time75it seems that the diagnostic value of saliva depends on how saliva specimens are collected saliva from deep throat 9167 and 8696 corresponding to two studies from oral cavity 50 or from salivary glands 1290 indicates a diagnostic tendency of decreased positive rate of 2019-ncov rna among covid-19 patients1114 for clinical application in need of high positive rate of virus detection saliva from deep throat has the highest positive rate which may stand for early diagnosis of covid-19 saliva directly from saliva glands ducts is associated with severe covid-19 and possibly could be a predictive and noninvasive test for severed patients whether 2019-ncov rna in saliva equals to infectious saliva or a condition of shedding vital virus is still lacking evidence even if diagnosis by saliva is noninvasive and less hazardous compared with throat swabs comprehensive diagnosis should be supported by complete information of symptoms epidemiological history and analysis of multiple clinical examinationsbesides lungs oral tissue is possible to be directly invaded theoretically due to expression of ace2 receptor and furin enzyme14293037 about half of the victims reported symptoms of dry mouth and amblygeustia14 these symptoms probably came from dysfunction of tongue expressing ace2 and furin and salivary gland expression ace2 however there is no histopathological evidence to support the direct invasion of 2019-ncov to oral tissue so far while it suggests that cells expressing ace2 and furin have lower restriction for virus entry theoretically the molecular mechanism of 2019-ncov infection is not yet fully unfolded and we should still be cautious about and not overstating the current virus-invade-host theorysaliva is a common and transient medium for virus transmission among saliva droplets with different sizes generated by breathing talking and sneezing large droplets easily fall onto the floor and only set up short-distance transmission39 saliva could form aerosols and reach a distant host along air flow when in a favorable environment39 so far no solid evidence supports that sars-ncov or 2019-ncov can survive in air outdoors for long time to set up long-distance aerosol transmission therefore wearing masks to prevent formation of infectious saliva droplets projecting to the air thorough disinfection of indoor air to block dissemination of infectious saliva droplets and keep a distance with people not to acquire infectious saliva droplets could slow down 2019-ncov epidemic to a certain degree fig 1fever during the first postoperative days following total joint arthroplasty is not uncommon 1 it is usually attributed locally to surgical trauma or postoperative hematoma absorption due to inflammatory cytokine accumulation 1 the duration and magnitude of fever as well as concomitant symptoms may raise the concern of early periprosthetic joint infection 1 other however equally important causes must be excluded such as chest or urinary tract bacterial infection deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolic events and more rarely concomitant respiratory viral infections 2 several clinical symptoms or laboratory tests may help reach a diagnosis however the diversity of differential aetiologies may delay proper treatment 2-3we report the case of a 70-year-woman who underwent total knee arthroplasty tka a week prior and presented with high fever myalgia and malaise fever was falsely attributed to wound inflammation and hematoma absorption leading to erroneous early management and a complicated postoperative coursea 70-year-old caucasian female patient suffering from left knee primary osteoarthritis underwent fully cemented tka under regional anesthesia past medical history included arterial hypertension long-standing well-controlled insulin-dependent diabetes glaucoma and mild obesity the procedure was uneventful a standard postoperative protocol was followed with partial weight-bearing and she was discharged home 48 hours postoperatively the patient had a low-grade fever during the first two postoperative days analgesics non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids and anticoagulation were prescribed as well as physiotherapy the day after discharge she felt unwell with muscle aching body fatigue and developed a temperature of 38c the clinical examination by a physician at home was focused on the surgical wound and the local hematoma absorption and she was treated with oral antibiotics cefuroxime 500 mg twice a day nsaids paracetamol hydration and observation attention was not turned to chest symptoms that were mild at the time with occasional coughing and intermittent chest pain despite antibiotic treatment the patient had persistent periodic high fever up to 385c myalgia fatigue and malaise along with mild coughing on the sixth postoperative day a second physician consultation by the telephone this time switched the antibiotic therapy to moxifloxacin 400 mg twice a day the high temperature did not subside the antibiotics made no difference to the symptoms the wound remained red and mildly inflamed coughing became intense but the patient did not have difficulty in breathingon the tenth postoperative day the patient turned up in our emergency department exhausted with high temperature up to 385c seeking orthopedic assistance for a knee infection she was unable to ambulate suffering from whole-body myalgia generic malaise and persistent cough but no dyspnea on knee clinical examination the wound was mildly inflamed with no effusion thus there was no suspicion of infection and aspiration deemed not necessary the patient had an unrestricted passive knee range of motion 0-100 degrees and the knee radiographs demonstrated stable well-aligned implants with no signs of effusion figures 1-2upon admission blood tests revealed a white blood count of 7400mm3 range3900-11100mm3 with a differential of 83 polymorphonuclears and 14 lymphocytes reduced hemoglobin of 95 gdl range118-148 gdl and hematocrit of 287 range 37-46 normal platelet of 279 x 103mm3 range 150-400 x 103mm3 and elevated serum creatinine 138 mgdl range 057-111 mgdl creatine phosphokinase 299ul range 29-168ul and lactate dehydrogenase 513ul range 125-220ul the blood coagulation test and urinalysis were normal the c-reactive protein test was not performed on admissionan infectious disease internist and pulmonologist were called upon to help diagnose and assist in managing the suspected infection chest radiograph revealed pneumonia of both lungs with ground-glass typical bilateral multifocal peripheral opacities due to an infectious organism figure 3 consequently coronavirus-19 disease covid-19 was suspected the patient was admitted to a specially dedicated ward for suspected covid-19 patients where pneumonia from sars-cov-2 was diagnosed the patient was transferred to a covid reference hospital and treated according to the covid-19 protocol she marginally escaped intubation though she went through significant respiratory distress for several days and is now slowly recoveringpneumonia is not an uncommon complication following orthopedic surgery 4-5 the incidence of postoperative pneumonia following elective hip and knee arthroplasty was reported to be 034 5 regardless of modern anesthetics and surgical progress postoperative pneumonia caused by bacterial viruses and fungi is still related to significant morbidity and mortality 4-5 patients that develop postoperative pneumonia following elective lower limb arthroplasty surgery have a 194 times higher mortality rate 5 underlying causes including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd asthma smoking diabetes obesity heart and renal diseases immunosuppression and old age have been reported 4 it is usually caused by bacteria the majority of them being gram-negative aerobic namely klebsiella pseudomonas and enterobacteria 4 viruses are atypical causative factors of postoperative pneumonia to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of postoperative pneumonia caused by the new sars-cov-2 masquerading as an acute postop periprosthetic joint infection following elective total knee arthroplastythe sars-cov-2 infection causes covid-19 an unusual type of viral pneumonia that was first reported in china 6 covid-19 rapidly evolved into a worldwide health emergency leading on 12 march 2020 the world health organization who to announce the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic 7 sars-cov-2 is highly contagious spreads easily sustainably and efficiently especially amongst susceptible people increasing the risk of postoperative pneumonia for people undergoing elective surgery 8 in the era of this pandemic any elective surgery must be postponed as the patients immunity is challenged by the trauma leaving the body ill defended against a viral insult the ministry of health of our country postponed all elective surgeries just one day following surgery of our patientin our patient the age of 70 years was a moderate risk factor that is enhanced however by mild obesity and chronic insulin-dependent diabetes and of course the surgical trauma that increased the susceptibility to infection the immune system of the patient was challenged postoperatively and became more susceptible to the highly contagious sars-cov-2the surgeon should always maintain the highest clinical awareness and level of suspicion recognizing signs and symptoms of any infection in our particular case the absence of the typical clinical signs and symptoms of early postoperative joint infection led the surgeon to explore other reasons for the symptomatology malaise myalgia high fever and coughing along with proper auscultation would have led to respiratory infection 8 in addition a low white cell count with mild lymphocytosis and a normal platelet count could help the differential diagnosis between bacterial and viral infections 8 besides elevated creatine phosphokinase cpk and lactate dehydrogenase ldh along with the ground-glass bilateral multifocal peripheral opacities in the chest radiograph recently correlated to the covid-19 infection could further help the diagnosis 8 an early proper surgical in-hospital assessment with possible knee aspiration would have established the diagnosis and is always advised in all arthroplasty patients regardless of social or medical restrictions asking patients to stay at home with fever following elective joint arthroplasty and offering antibiotics without a proper clinical examination and blood testing is ill-advised even in the era of social distancing measures due to the sars-cov-2 pandemiccovid-19 symptoms can masquerade as an acute postoperative periprosthetic joint infection in the era of the covid-19 pandemic a high index of suspicion for covid-19 symptoms must be raised especially in vulnerable patients during the early postoperative period elective orthopedic surgery should be postponed as the iatrogenic trauma challenges the immune system and the energy equilibrium may be shifted negatively leaving the body ill-defended against a very aggressive insult of the sort of sars-cov-2 during the era of the sars-cov-2 pandemic the social distancing rule stay at home applies to all except early postoperative patients with worsening malaise myalgia fever and coughing keeping in mind that covid-19 may masquerade the symptoms of a postoperative periprosthetic joint infectionthe coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory infections ranging from mild symptoms to severe pneumonia 2019-ncov is a new type of coronavirus which was first identified in china since its detection in humans at the end of 2019 it has rapidly spread worldwide causing respiratory infections of various degrees of severity the most common symptoms which develop within 214 days of exposure are dry cough fever and fatigue1 2 mild infections may be self-limiting in few days but in some cases the respiratory symptoms can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome ards with a high risk of death from multiorgan failurenasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be used to confirm the presence of 2019-ncov a ct scan of the chest is the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of lung involvement ground-glass opacity and crazy-craving patterning are the most common radiological signs of covid-19 pneumonia ct is commonly used to evaluate lung damage during recovery3 recently we investigated the role of lung us in the early detection of covid-19 pneumonia and showed a strong correlation between lung us and ct scans in all investigated patients4no specific treatment or vaccines against covid-19 are currently available covid-19 patients can be treated with antivirals but there is no clear evidence of benefit 5 the most important way to fight this viral infection is to detect covid-19 early isolate cases trace contacts and deliver the correct information to the general public 6gastrointestinal involvement such as abdominal pain nausea vomiting and diarrhoea has been recently reported in the literature7 diarrhoea occurs secondary to the interaction between ace2 highly expressed in the human small intestine and 2019-ncov cell entry receptor ace2 recent studies show that 2019-ncov rna has been detected in stool samples confirming faecaloral transmission according to the literature the incidence of diarrhoea could be underestimated8in the current case report we consider covid-19 infection in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal symptoms in 10 patients who referred to our emergency department in february 2020 at the beginning of the spread of covid-19 in italyten patients 6 males 4 females with mean age 5018 years were admitted to our emergency department complaining of fever and flu-like symptoms in the previous 510 days with general malaise decreased appetite abdominal pain and vomitingdiarrhoea only one patient denied cough and fever none of them had a history of abdominal surgery or a notable medical history including inflammatory bowel disease they reported no melena or weight loss diarrhoea was defined according the who criteria as having three or more loose or liquid stools per day or having more stools than normal physical examinations were normal with no distended abdomens tenderness or hypohyperactive bowel sounds the vital signs were in the normal range with a maximum body temperature of 39c 3761c at admission four patients complained of dyspnoea with significantly decreased pao2fio2 and a need for oxygena nasopharyngeal swab sample confirmed covid-19 infection in all patients the patients characteristics at admission are reported in table 1laboratory tests revealed lymphopenia high c-reactive protein and altered liver enzymes in most of the patients as reported in table 2 tests revealed an average white blood cell count wbc of 615 32929 109l platelets plt 1767

aminotransferase was 819 30284 ul and ggt gamma glutamyltransferase was 123 54218 ul bilirubin was increased in only one patient pt 2 table 2 who developed pancytopenia and haemolytic anaemia which improved with oral steroid therapy the average value of crp was 66 152137 mgdl when measured procalcitonin was always undetectable excluding a bacterial infection despite the diarrhoea only two patients had slowly increasing creatinine levels pt 7 and 9 table 2 the serum potassium level was in the normal range in all patients in the patient who complained only of diarrhoea with no flu-like symptoms pt 1 table 1 we performed stool cultures for clostridium difficile and enteric pathogens which were all negativeall patients were investigated with bedside us which showed a diffuse b-pattern due to a severe loss of aeration with spared areas with no pleural effusion in six patients subpleural consolidation in the lower lobes was detected chest ct confirmed covid-19 pneumonia with typical imaging signs of ground-glass opacity patchy consolidation and crazy-paving patterning which were also detected by lung us an x-ray of the abdomen was performed in only one patient pt 2 table 1 and was normal us of the abdomen did not reveal an abnormal stomach and bowel distention except in one female patient pt 8 table 1 who had bowel inflammatory signs peri-intestinal inflammatory reaction as confirmed by a ct scan of the abdomen this patient completely recovered after antiviral treatment and was discharged home with no signs of bowel disease on us of the abdomenall the patients were treated with supportive care and antiviral therapy including lopinavir and ritonavir tablets diarrhoea completely resolved six patients have been discharged with the diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia and diarrhoea four patients pt 3 7 9 10 tables 1 and 2 developed acute severe respiratory distress syndrome requiring immediate intubation they are still in intensive care unit at the time of writingabdominal pain is a real challenge for critical care physicians since there are many potential diagnoses signs and symptoms are often non-specific and can mask life-threating conditions the consequences of wrongly attributing the pain can be serious for patients although gastrointestinal symptoms are less common in patients with covid-19 infection the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 cannot be excluded and must be investigated in all patients referred to the emergency department we strongly recommend bedside lung us to detect signs of interstitial pneumonia even in absence of respiratory symptoms early suspicion and diagnosis are essential to contain the global spread of covid-19 infection and its potentially fatal complications such as acute respiratory distress syndromeas the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is rapidly expanding in china and beyond with the potential to become a worldwide pandemic1 real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions2 previously real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility severity and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the 2009 influenza pandemic and ebola3 4 5 6 analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters such as the incubation and infectious periods and delays between infection and detection isolation and reporting of cases3 4 however official individual patient data rarely become publicly available early on in an outbreak when the information is most neededbuilding on our previous experience collating news reports to monitor transmission of ebola virus7 here we present an effort to compile individual patient information and subnational epidemic curves on covid-19 from a variety of online resources data were made publicly available in real time and were used by the infectious disease modelling community to generate and compare epidemiological estimates relevant to interventions we describe the data generation process and provide an early analysis of age patterns of covid-19 case counts across china and internationally and delays between symptom onset admissions to hospital and reporting for cases reported until jan 31 2020
research in context
evidence before this study
an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was recognised in early january 2020 in wuhan city hubei province china the new virus is thought to have originated from an animal-to-human spillover event linked to seafood and live-animal markets the infection has spread locally in wuhan and elsewhere in china despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on jan 23 2020 more than 500 patients infected with covid-19 outside of mainland china have been reported between jan 1 and feb 14 2020 although laboratory testing for covid-19 quickly ramped up in china and elsewhere information on individual patients remains scarce and official datasets have not been made publicly available patient-level information is important to estimate key time-to-delay events such as the incubation period and interval between symptom onset and visit to a hospital analyse the age profile of infected patients reconstruct epidemic curves by onset dates and infer transmission parameters we searched pubmed for publications between jan 1 1990 and feb 6 2020 using combinations of the following terms coronavirus or 2019-ncov and line list or case description or patient data and digital surveillance or social media or crowd-sourced data the search retrieved one relevant study on middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus that mentioned flutrackers in their discussion a website that aggregates epidemiological information on emerging pathogens however flutrackers does not report individual-level data on covid-19
added value of this study
to our knowledge this is the first study that uses crowdsourced data from social media sources to monitor the covid-19 outbreak we searched dxycn a chinese health-care-oriented social network that broadcasts information from local and national health authorities to reconstruct patient-level information on covid-19 in china we also queried international media sources and national health agency websites to collate data on international exportations of covid-19 we describe the demographic characteristics delays between symptom onset seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting for 507 patients infected with covid-19 reported until jan 31 2020 the overall cumulative progression of the outbreak is consistent between our line list and an official report published by the chinese national health authorities on jan 28 2020 the estimated incubation period in our data aligns with that of previous work our dataset was made available in the public domain on jan 21 2020
implications of all the available evidence
crowdsourced line-list data can be reconstructed from social media data especially when a central resource is available to curate relevant information public access to line lists is important so that several teams with different expertise can provide their own insights and interpretations of the data especially in the early phase of an outbreak when little information is available publicly available line lists can also increase transparency the main issue with the quality of patient-level data obtained during health emergencies is the potential lack of information from locations overwhelmed by the outbreak in this case hubei province and other provinces with weaker health infrastructures future studies based on larger samples of patients with covid-19 could explore in more detail the transmission dynamics of the outbreak in different locations the effectiveness of interventions and the demographic factors driving transmission
in this population-level observational study we used crowdsourced reports from dxycn a social network for chinese physicians health-care professionals pharmacies and health-care facilities established in 2000 this online platform is providing real-time coverage of the covid-19 outbreak in china obtained by collating and curating reports from news media government television and national and provincial health agencies the information reported includes time-stamped cumulative counts of covid-19 infections outbreak maps and real-time streaming of health authority announcements in chinese directly or through state media8 every report is linked to an online source which can be accessed for more detailed information on individual casesthese are publicly available de-identified patient data reported directly by public health authorities or by state media no patient consent was needed and no ethics approval was requiredwe closely monitored updates on dxycn between jan 20 2020 and jan 31 2020 to extract key information on individual patients in near real-time and reports of daily case counts for individual-level patient data we used descriptions from the original source in chinese to retrieve age sex province of identification travel history reporting date dates of symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic and discharge status when available individual-level patient data were formatted into a line-list database for further quantitative analysis individual-level patient data were entered from dxycn by a native chinese speaker ks who also generated an english summary for each patient entries were checked by a second person jc since dxycn primarily provides information on patients reported in china we also compiled additional information on internationally exported cases of covid-19 we obtained data for 21 countries outside of mainland china australia cambodia canada france germany hong kong india italy japan malaysia nepal russia singapore south korea sri lanka taiwan thailand united arab emirates the uk the usa and vietnam we gathered and cross-checked data for infected patients outside of china using several sources including global news media kyodo news straits times and cnn official press releases from each countrys ministry of health and disease control agenciesin addition to detailed information on individual patients we reconstructed the daily progression of reported patients in each province of china from jan 13 until jan 31 2020 we used the daily outbreak situation reports communicated by provincial health authorities covered by state television and media and posted on dxycn all patients in our databases had a laboratory confirmed sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infectionour covid-19 database was made publicly available as a google sheet disseminated via twitter on jan 21 2020 and posted on the website of northeastern university boston ma usa on jan 24 2020 where it is updated in real time data used in this analysis frozen at jan 31 2020 are available online as a spreadsheetwe assessed the age distribution of all patients with covid-19 by discharge status we adjusted the age profile of chinese patients by the population of china we used 2016 population estimates from the institute for health metrics and evaluation9 to calculate the relative risk rr of infection with covid-19 by age group to calculate the rr we followed the method used by lemaitre and colleagues10 to explore the age profile of influenza where rr for age group i is defined as
rriciiciniini
where c
i is the number of cases in age group i and n
i is the population size of age group ito estimate trends in the strength of case detection and interventions we analysed delays between symptom onset and visit to a health-care provider at a hospital or clinic and from seeking care at a hospital or clinic to reporting by time period and location we considered the period before and after jan 18 2020 when media attention and awareness of the outbreak became more pronounced11 we used non-parametric tests to assess differences in delays between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting between locations wilcoxon test to compare two locations and kruskallwallis test to compare three or more locationswe estimated the duration of the incubation period on the basis of our line list data we analysed a subset of patients returning from wuhan who had spent less than a week in wuhan to ensure a narrowly defined exposure window the incubation period was estimated as the midpoint between the time spent in wuhan and the date of symptom onsetwe did all analyses in r version 353 we considered p values of less than 005 to be significantthe funder had no role in study design data compilation data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report all authors had access to the data and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationour line list comprised 507 patients reported from jan 13 to jan 31 2020 including 364 72 from mainland china and 143 28 from outside of china table
 our sample captured 52 of 9826 covid-19 cases reported by who on jan 31 2020 the sex ratio was skewed towards males in mainland china five of 30 provinces were represented with 133 26 patients reported by beijing 87 17 by shaanxi 41 8 by hubei capital city is wuhan 19 4 by tianjin and 22 4 by yunnan of 435 patients with known relation to wuhan city most reported a travel history to the city 135 30 or were residents of the city 152 30 while 80 16 had no direct relation to the city 122 24 patients all reported in beijing had no information about their recent history with wuhanthe age distribution of covid-19 cases was skewed towards older age groups with a median age of 45 years iqr 3356 for patients who were alive or who had an unknown outcome at the time of reporting figure 1
 the median age of patients who had died at the time of reporting was 70 years iqr 6581 few patients 13 3 were younger than 15 years adjustment for the age demographics of china confirmed a deficit of infections among children with a rr below 05 in patients younger than 15 years figure 1 the rr measure indicated a sharp increase in the likelihood of reported covid-19 among people aged 30 years and oldera timeline of cases in our crowdsourced patient line list is shown by date of onset in figure 2
 indicating an acceleration of reported cases by jan 13 2020 the outbreak progression based on the crowdsourced patient line list was consistent with the timeline published by china center for disease control and prevention cdc on jan 28 202012 which is based on a more comprehensive database of more than 6000 patients with covid-19 since jan 23 2020 the cumulative number of cases has slowed down in the crowdsourced and china cdc curves figure 2 which probably reflects the delay between disease onset and reporting the median reporting delay was 5 days iqr 38 in our dataprovince-level epidemic curves are shown by reporting date in figure 3
 as of jan 31 2020 16 52 of 30 provinces in mainland china had reported more than 100 confirmed cases the apparent rapid growth of newly reported cases between jan 18 and jan 31 2020 in several provinces outside of hubei province is consistent with sustained local transmissionacross the study period the median delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was 2 days iqr 05 days in mainland china figure 4
 this delay decreased from 5 days before jan 18 2020 to 2 days thereafter wilcoxon test p00009 some provinces such as tianjin and yunnan had shorter delays data by province not shown while the early cases from hubei province were characterised by longer delays in seeking care median 0 days iqr 01the median delay between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting was 2 days iqr 25 days in mainland china and decreased from 9 days before jan 18 2020 to 2 days thereafter wilcoxon test p00001 figure 4 similarly to delays in seeking care at a hospital or clinic reporting was quickest in tianjin and yunnan median 1 day iqr 01 and slowest in hubei province median 12 days iqr 716the median delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was 1 day iqr 03 for international travellers and shorter than for patients in hubei province or the rest of mainland china kruskalwallis test p00001 figure 4 even in the period after jan 18 2020 when awareness of the outbreak increased a shorter delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was seen for international patients than for those in mainland china wilcoxon test p00001 for international cases the delay between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting was 2 days iqr 14 also shorter than for mainland china wilcoxon test p00001 figure 4on the basis of 33 patients with a travel history to wuhan we estimated the median incubation period for covid-19 to be 45 days iqr 3055 appendix p 2information from patient line lists is crucial but difficult to obtain at the beginning of an outbreak here we have shown that careful compilation of crowdsourced reports curated by a long-standing chinese medical social network provides a valuable picture of the outbreak of covid-19 in real time the outbreak timeline is consistent with aggregated case counts provided by health authorities for comparison china cdc published the first epidemic curve by symptom onset on jan 28 202012 line lists provide unique information on the delays between symptom onset and detection by the health-care system reporting delays and travel histories this information cannot be extracted from aggregated case counts published by official sources line list data can help assess the effectiveness of interventions and the potential for widespread transmission beyond the initial foci of infection in particular shorter delays between symptom onset and admission to hospital or seeking care in a hospital or clinic accelerate detection and isolation of cases effectively shortening the infectious perioda useful feature of our crowdsourced database was the availability of travel histories for patients returning from wuhan which along with dates of symptom onset allowed for estimation of the incubation period here and in related work13 14 a narrow window of exposure could be defined for a subset of patients who had a short stay in wuhan at a time when the epidemic was still localised to wuhan several teams have used our dataset and datasets from others to estimate a mean incubation period for covid-19 to be 56 days 95 ci 21113 14 15 16 our own estimate median 45 days iqr 3055 is consistent with previous work that used other modelling approaches13 14 15 16 the incubation period is a useful parameter to guide isolation and contact tracing based on existing data the disease status of a contact should be known with near certainty after a period of observation of 14 days13 availability of a public dataset enables independent estimation of important epidemiological parameters by several teams allowing for confirmation and cross-checking at a time when information can be conflicting and noisyan interesting finding in our data relates to the age distribution of patients we found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups with substantially fewer children infected this pattern could indicate age-related differences in susceptibility to infection severe outcomes or behaviour however a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers a population that is usually predominantly adults although does not exclude children furthermore because patient data in our dataset were captured by the health system they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease especially for patients from mainland china clinical reports have shown that severity of covid-19 is associated with the presence of chronic conditions16 17 which are more frequent in older age groups nevertheless we would also expect children younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the health-care system as is seen for other respiratory infections18
biological differences could have a role in shaping these age profiles a detailed analysis of one of the early covid-19 clusters by chan and colleagues19 revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household while a child in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect children from sars20 21 and so might also have a role in covid-19 in any case if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress globally we would expect an increase in respiratory mortality concentrated among people aged 30 years and older this mortality pattern would be substantially different from the profile of the 2009 influenza pandemic for which excess mortality was concentrated in those younger than 65 years21
in our dataset we saw a rapid increase in the number of people infected with covid-19 in several provinces of china consistent with local transmission outside of hubei province as of jan 31 2020 province-level epidemic curves are only available by date of reporting rather than date of symptom onset which usually inflates recent case counts if detection has increased furthermore province-level data include both returning travellers from hubei province ie importations and locally acquired cases which also usually inflate the apparent risk of local transmission notably other lines of evidence suggest that local transmission is now well established outside of hubei province because travel increased just before the chinese new year on jan 25 2020 and before implementation of the travel ban in wuhan22 accordingly our own data include evidence of transmission clusters in non-travellers with for instance a second-generation transmission event reported in shaanxi on jan 21 2020our study had several limitations one of which was the data we used although all provinces in mainland china provide aggregated information on infections and deaths individual-level patient descriptions are only available for a subset of provinces geographical coverage is heterogeneous in our line list and we have a notable deficit of cases from hubei province the foci of the covid-19 outbreak we expect that little patient-level information is shared on social media by province-level and city-level health authorities in wuhan and hubei province because health systems are overwhelmed for similar reasons provinces with a large total case count at the end of january 2020 or with a weaker health infrastructure were under-represented in our line list with the exception of beijing other limitations in our data include severity only patients who had severe enough symptoms to seek care were captured and changes in case definition a series of epidemiological criteria were required for covid-19 testing including travel history to wuhan within the past 2 weeks residence in wuhan within the past 2 weeks contact with individuals from wuhan with fever and respiratory symptoms within the past 2 weeks and being part of an established disease cluster some of these criteria eg relation to wuhan were relaxed over time appendix as a result we have an over-representation of travel-related cases in our databasethe reproduction number is an important quantity for outbreak control we refrained from estimating this parameter because reporting changes could bias estimates relying on epidemic growth rates furthermore our dataset captured cases all over china and does not reflect transmission patterns in any particular location a mean reproduction number of 2527 has previously been estimated on the basis of the volume of importations of international cases in the pre-intervention period in wuhan11
we recognise that although our data source is useful and timely it should not replace official statistics manual compilation of detailed line lists from media sources is highly time consuming and is not sustainable when case counts reach several thousands here we provide detailed data on 507 patients when the official case count was over 9000 by jan 31 2020 representing a sample of approximately 5 of reported cases and a much smaller proportion of the full spectrum of covid-19 cases which include mild infections a crowdsourced system would not be expected to catch all cases especially if many cases are too mild to be captured by the health-care system digital surveillance or social media notably dxycn does not generate data outside of traditional surveillance systems but rather provides a channel of rapid communication between the public and health authorities in turn our approach has helped extract and repackage information from health authorities into an analytical format which was not available elsewhereat the time of writing efforts are underway to coordinate compilation of covid-19 data from online sources across several academic teams ultimately we expect that a line list of patients will be shared by government sources with the global community however data cleaning and access issues might take a prohibitively long time to resolve for the west african ebola outbreak a similarly coordinated effort to publish a line list took 2 years23 given the progression of the covid-19 outbreak such a long delay would be counterproductiveoverall the novelty of our approach was to rely on a unique source for social media and news reports in china which aggregated and curated relevant information this approach facilitated entry of robust and standard data on clinical and demographic information reassuringly dxycn maintains a special section dedicated to debunking fake news myths and rumours about the covid-19 outbreak looking to the future collection of patient data in the context of emergencies could include information on whether patients are identified through contact tracing or because they seek care on their own furthermore data interpretability could be improved by gathering more quantitative information on how case definitions are used in practicein conclusion crowdsourced epidemiological data can be useful to monitor emerging outbreaks such as covid-19 and as previously ebola virus7 these efforts can help generate and disseminate detailed information in the early stages of an outbreak when little other data are available enabling independent estimation of key parameters that affect interventions based on our small sample of patients with covid-19 we note an intriguing age distribution reminiscent of that of sars which warrants further epidemiological and serological studies we also report early signs that the response is strengthening in china on the basis of a decrease in case detection time and rapid management of travel-related infections that are identified internationally this is an early report of a rapidly evolving situation and the parameters discussed here could change quickly in the coming weeks we will continue to monitor the epidemiology of this outbreak using data from news reports and official sources

date dates of symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic relation to wuhan discharge status when known an english summary of the case description from media sources and a link to the original source of datahuman coronaviruses are positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family and human coronavirus infections have become global concerns since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 in 20022003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 recently a new coronavirus novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which was initially identified in wuhan hubei province china in early december 2019 has rapidly spread worldwide and has been subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the disease caused by this organism is called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the genetic sequences of this virus are at least 70 identical to those of sars-cov-1 and 50 similar to those of mers-cov and it is the seventh member of the coronaviridae family that can infect humans 1sars-cov-2 may have originated from horseshoe bats a reservoir for sars-cov-1 and is responsible for rapid human-to-human transmission worldwide as of 1222 am gmt on april 8 2020 a total of 1 428 428 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 82 020 deaths across 184 countries have been reported 2 respiratory symptoms such as fever cough and dyspnea are common although the potential transmission of viruses by asymptomatic patients remains a problem approximately 20 of sars-cov-2 infections were reported as severe and the mortality rate was 3 3 while droplet and contact transmission are the main modes of disease transmission airborne transmission is also occasionally possible consistent with the findings for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov infections the incubation period of this virus ranges from 2 to 14 days early detection of sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of those patients from the naive population are important steps to prevent an epidemic spread of the infection in this updated review we expand on the information presented in our 2018 article 4 and focus on the clinical features and chest ct findings of sars-cov-2 pneumonia to help radiologists detect the disease at its early stageto prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 to health care workers or other patients laboratory test sampling should be performed in a dedicated isolated location where contact is strictly limited between others and patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection most patients with sars-cov-2 infection have normal white blood cell and neutrophil counts as well as a normal or reduced lymphocyte count 5 c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr levels can be slightly high but the procalcitonin level is usually normal a high procalcitonin level indicates a bacterial coinfectiona reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test of an upper respiratory tract specimen obtained with nasopharyngeal swab andor oropharyngeal swab andor sputum sample is the standard diagnostic tool for determining hospitalization and isolation of patients with sars-cov infection however the positivity rate for rt-pcr tests on throat samples is reportedly 5971 67 possibly owing to a low viral load specimen error andor laboratory error assays for the target sites of the virus genome e gene orf1ab region rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene and n gene are performed as first-line confirmatory and additional confirmatory assaysthe pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 is still under investigation in an in vitro study sars-cov-2 inoculation into the human airway epithelial layers induced cytopathic effects 1 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors on the surface of sars-cov-2 anchor onto the respiratory cells as well as onto the pneumocytes present in the nasopharyngeal mucosa and consequently induce viremia high levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines were noted in severely ill patients infected with sars-cov-2 table 1 8 these results suggest that an immunopathologic mechanism may be responsible for the progression of disease severitychest radiographs may show bilateral infiltrates but the findings may be nonspecific or normal fig 1 during the early stage of sars-cov-2 infection ct findings of pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 are similar to those findings of pneumonia caused by other human coronaviruses which are characterized by ground-glass opacities and consolidations 4910 comparable with pneumonia caused by the two other coronaviruses sars-cov-1 and mers-cov the most common ct finding for sars-cov-2 pneumonia is ground-glass opacity figs 1 2 a reversed halo sign is an uncommon ct feature but could be visualized in the early stage of sars-cov-2 pneumoniaduring the sars-cov-2 epidemic situation in china the sensitivity of chest ct for identifying sars-cov-2 pneumonia cases has been reported to be 97 95 confidence interval 95 98 6 the high sensitivity of chest ct was considered in part a result of imaging patients who were at a relatively advanced stage of sars-cov-2 pneumonia consolidation is noted as the second most common finding during the first 11 days of symptom onset 11 approximately half of the patients were diagnosed with multifocal ground-glass opacity and consolidation and reticulation or nodules are rare 6 serial follow-up chest ct can help indicate the evolution of the disease and help monitor therapeutic effects 1213 bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities are predominant patterns after symptom onset 11 and the extent of ground-glass opacity and consolidation occasionally manifesting as a crazy-paving pattern increases as the disease progresses and peaks at 611 days 12 bilaterality was noted among 76 of cases 35 days after initial symptom onset 1112 severe cases manifest as acute respiratory distress syndrome with diffuse haziness of the bilateral lungs fig 3 images obtained in most patients 75 who are in the recovery phase after 2 weeks from initial symptom onset show a gradual resolution of consolidation with residual ground-glass opacity fig 4 13although more than 70 of sars-cov-2 pneumonia cases exhibit typical ct findings not every case of sars-cov-2 pneumonia is distinguishable from other types of viral pneumonia chest ct findings sometimes result in a false-positive diagnosis owing to overlapping ct manifestations the differential diagnosis of sars-cov-2 pneumonia includes other pneumonia-causing viral pathogens and their ct findings are briefly described in table 2 detailed ct findings and relevant images have been provided in a previous article 4a study involving the use of chest ct for differentiating sars-cov-2 pneumonia from other types of viral pneumonia found that radiologists who were blinded to rt-pcr results could correctly distinguish cases of sars-cov-2 infection with 6797 sensitivity 7 peripheral distribution and ground-glass opacity were significantly noted characteristics of sars-cov-2 pneumonia and fine reticular opacity and vascular thickening were also a more commonly noted pattern in half of the sars-cov-2 pneumonia cases as opposed to other viral pneumonia cases pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were uncommonas an initial laboratory test a respiratory virus nucleic acid test is commonly performed to detect other common respiratory viruses such as adenovirus parainfluenza virus respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus in addition considering the potential false-negative results of laboratory tests and highly contagious nature of the viruses chest ct could prove to be a fast diagnostic tool in combination with clinical manifestations for diagnosing sars-cov-2 infection ct images are helpful to distinguish sars-cov-2 pneumonia in suspicious cases with initially negative molecular test results and some of these cases could show positive results at repeat molecular testing during the follow-up monitoring periodchest ct is useful for diagnosis and establishing the next management strategies including patient isolation however radiation exposure the risk of the virus spreading to health care workers medical costs and the time required for disinfecting imaging examination rooms are considerable factors that make us consider the appropriateness of performing imaging as droplet and contact transmissions are the main modes of spread for sars-cov-2 all patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection who undergo radiologic imaging should be masked and imaged using a separated dedicated imaging machine the imaging location should be disinfected after each imaging examination health care workers who manage patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection should wear a medical mask and goggles and the use of an isolation gown is recommendeda multidisciplinary panel of experienced radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries suggested the utility of imaging within clinical scenarios representing community situations medical resources and various risk factors 14 on the basis of this suggestion and experience managing patients with covid-19 we provide a brief clinical setting to show the use of chest ct to facilitate the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 pneumonia fig 5for the management of patients with respiratory symptoms in endemic areas an rt-pcr test is the primary diagnostic tool used for discriminating sars-cov-2positive cases after confirming sars-cov-2 infection chest ct could be used to evaluate disease severity fig 5 clinical judgment regarding the use of chest ct is dependent on the patient risk factors related to covid-19 such as age greater than 65 years and any comorbiditiesthe availability of local medical resources including medical team members personal protection devices rt-pcr tests hospital containment beds and ventilators has also affected the process of patient management in the situation of significant medical resource constraints a patient with mild symptoms of covid-19 without significant respiratory dysfunction does not require chest ct examinationchest ct is considered in patients with moderate to severe symptoms with pulmonary dysfunction or damage if a patient has contact history with a confirmed sars-cov-2infected patient chest ct could be performed as the next step for excluding a potential false-negative outcome from a negative rt-pcr test result in cases with typical ct findings bilateral ground-glass opacity consolidation and fine reticulation sars-cov-2 infection is highly suspected therefore a repeat rt-pcr test is warranted even if the first rt-pcr test result was negative in a case with atypical ct findings fig 4 there could be a probability of infection by other pathogens but a repeat rt-pcr test or follow-up ct is still necessary especially for patients with underlying comorbidities the ct findings could be subtle during the early stage of infectionif no abnormalities are detected on chest ct images patients are still recommended to maintain a 2-week isolation period in their personal space or home to prevent community transmission owing to a potential false-negative result in a scenario wherein rt-pcr tests for sars-cov-2 are unavailable chest ct could be used as a screening tool for identifying potential patients with sars-cov-2 pneumoniain an endemic area it is not only the management of a patient with respiratory symptoms that needs attention because an asymptomatic patient in the early stage of covid-19 is also a source of infection transmission taking a careful history and performing rt-pcr tests are necessary when radiologists incidentally detect imaging findings suggestive of covid-19 at chest ct in routine practicealthough various trials for developing treatment strategies for sars-cov-2 infection are ongoing there are no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines for this disease to date patients with sars-cov-2 infection need to be isolated in a designated area to prevent further spread of the virus and intensive care is critical for severely ill patients current management methods for sars-cov-2 pneumonia are based on optimal conservative care including respiratory support similar to plasma transfusion used as treatment of mers-cov infection the blood plasma of patients who recovered from sars-cov-2 infection which contained neutralizing antibodies was transfused in several patients with sars-cov-2 infection 15 however further tests for the validation of this strategy are necessarychest ct can be used as a rapid diagnostic tool in combination with clinical manifestations to diagnose sars-cov-2 infectionsince december 2019 cases of unexplained pneumonia have occurred in wuhan city hubei

the levels of n-igm n-igg s-igm s-igg were measured by elisa serum samples from 16
healthy people were used as negative controls the cut-off value for seropositivity
samples was set as the mean value at optical density 450 at a 150 dilution for the 16
negative serum samples plus 3 standard deviations sds which were 0394 0291 0284
and 0170 for n-igm n-igg s-igm and s-igg respectively the results showed that within one week after the symptom onset the seropositive rates
of n-igm n-igg and s-igm in non-icu patients were 417 and the seropositive rate of

that there was an igm to igg class-switch from in most non-icu patients

supplementary fig4b d c-reactive protein crp is an acute protein that rises sharply in the plasma when the
body is infected or the tissue is damaged it is a non-specific marker of inflammation and
directly participates in the host defence against infection the levels of n and s
specific igm and igg were evaluated for correlations with crp levels in non-icu patients
as the disease progressed the increase of s-igg positively correlated with the decrease
of crp in non-icu patients figure 4b the
correlation coefficients r were 09 p  0001 however the changes of
n-igg showed no correlation with the changes of crp in non-icu patients figure 4a the changes of n-igm and s-igm also showed no

and higher igm to igg class switch than icu patients table 3 supplementary fig2 supplementary fig3 this result suggested that
the class switch of s-igm to s-igg is vital for clearing the viruses and can be used as a
prognosis indicator to predict the outcome of covid-19 disease this study investigated the kinetics of n and s specific igm and igg responses in covid-19
patients after symptom onset a total of 130 blood samples from 38 covid-19 patients were
analyzed our study showed that the seropositive rates of n-igm n-igg s-igm and s-igg
antibody responses in non-icu patients gradually increased within 13 weeks after the onset
n-igm and s-igm reached a peak in the second week while n-igg and s-igg antibodies
continued to increase in the third week joint detection of n-igm n-igg s-igm and s-igg
antibodies could detect up to 75 of infections in the first week joint detection of
n-igm  n-igg or n-igg  s-igg could detect up to 947 of infections in the second week
in the third weeks after symptom onset seropositive rates for n-igg and s-igg reached 100
in contrast seropositive rates for n-igm and s-igm remained the same as some patients
started to decline as the result of igm to igg isotype switch which may help to generate
more effective antibodies that can inhibit virus infectionthe effective method to control the spread of the virus is the early diagnosis and early
isolation of patients however the incubation period of the sars-cov-2 and the limitation
of q-pcr for nucleic acid detection affect the positive rate of early diagnosis it has been
reported that the serum antibody elisa and q-pcr combined detection may increase the
positive rate for the early diagnosis of covid-19 infection 2023 during the
preparation of this manuscript a paper reported antibody detection in 23 covid-19 patients
the seropositivity rates were 94 for anti-np igg 88 for anti-np igm 100 for anti-rbd
igg and 94 for anti-rbd igm 21 however the
blood samples were collected at 14 days or later after symptom onset but not in the first
week as our study which can be more useful for diagnostic purpose it is also important to
note that rbd only represents a small part of s protein 237 amino acids in rbd as compared
to1273 amino acids in s protein therefore the anti-rbd igm and anti-rbd igg response may
not represent the antibody response to s protein based on our study we proposed that the
combined detection of both n and s specific igm and igg may improve the serological
detection rate sars-cov-2 infection in the early stage while the decline of igmigg ratio
may help to identify the post-infected people although it is still too early to know when
igm will wane over time there may be a concern that potential cross-reactivity of
sars-cov-2 n proteins with other human coronaviruses which may affect the seropositive rate
of sars-cov-2 an earlier analysis showed that there were no cross-reactivity of sars-cov-2
n protein with human plasma positive for igg antibodies against human coronaviruses nl63
229e oc43 and hku1 there is a cross-reactivity between sars-cov positive human plasma and
sars-cov-2 n protein 20 the patients in this
study have not been infected with sars-cov we also confirmed the specificity of n and s
antigens that we used in our study by checking cross-reactivity with serum samples from
people infected with other human coronaviruses and human adenovirus from people vaccinated
with influenza virus vaccine and from early collections there was also a report of serum
detection of n specific igm igg and iga in 135 patients of lower respiratory infection and
150 healthy individuals all showed no reactivity with sars-cov-2 n proteins 20the clinical symptoms characteristics and progression of the 27 non-icu patients and 11
icu patients in this study were similar to those of the previously reported covid-19
patients 10132426 recently a
retrospective study found that the critically ill patients fatality rate reached 615
within 28 days and the median time from icu to death was 7 days 27 a case of covid-19 death study found that the crp increased
significantly after the onset of the patient and lasted for more than 14 days 11 in our study crp also increased significantly
in most patients the increase of s-igg in non-icu patients positively correlated with the
decrease of crp which has not been reported before notably in the third week after
symptom onset n-igg was significantly higher while s-igg is significantly lower in icu
patients than in non-icu patients non-icu patients tend to produce s-igg antibodies while
icu patients tend to produce n-igg antibodies interestingly s-igg had a parallel or
similar dynamic pattern as s-igm in the first two weeks but s-igg continued to increase in
the third week while s-igm in some patients showed plateau or decline in some patients the
similar pattern also occurred in non-icu patients but not in icu patients this result
suggested that the early class switching of igm to igg may help predict a better outcome of
covid-19 diseaseit has been recognized that s-specific antibodies can block the binding of s protein to
cellular receptor hace2 that mediates sars-cov-2 binding and entry to target cells there
was no evidence that n-specific antibodies can block virus infection n protein is a
suitable candidate for early diagnosis of infection due to its high immunogenicity and
intracellular accumulation before the packaging of the virus 2830 a previous study on sars-cov
infection indicated that igg response is directed most frequently and predominantly at the n
protein 89 but not s protein 63 31 in
this study we found that most icu patients had higher n-igg than s-igg after the symptom
onset which may be caused by longer and a large amount of virus exposure in the early
infections of icu patients it is important to note that icu patients had sars-cov-2 nucleic
acid positive days of 310 whereas non-icu patients had sars-cov-2 nucleic acid positive
days of 13 therefore a continuous increase of n-igg may indicate disease progression
towards more severe illness in contrast s-igg increased slowly in icu patients research
about the contributions of the structural proteins of sars-cov to protective immunity
indicated that only s protein induced a high titre of sars-cov-neutralizing antibodies and
protective efficacy in hamsters but not n protein matrix m and small envelope e proteins
32 homology modelling and structural
evidence revealed that sars-cov-2 had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of
sars-cov despite amino acid variation at some key residues 23 in this study we
found that s-igg in icu patients was significantly lower than non-icu patients by 2 weeks
after the onset which may explain the longer hospital stays and nucleic acid positive days
in icu patients therefore monitoring the kinetics of s-igg should help to predict
prognosissince december 2019 several cases of coronavirus disease covid-19 emerged in wuhan hubei province china13 sars-cov-2 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols direct contact and stool8 9 covid-19 is very contagious and the general population is highly susceptible to infection the number of affected countries and number of deaths have increased dramatically since the beginning of the outbreak4 covid-19 infection reached more than 130 countries according to the world health organization as of april 17 2020 more than 2034802 confirmed cases were reported worldwide and more than 135163 infected patients died5 therefore covid-19 is a serious health problem worldwidecoronavirus can affect multiple organs including the lungs1 the main clinical presentation of covid-19 is pneumonia most patients have mild disease with common respiratory symptoms and good prognosis6 the most common clinical symptoms are fever and cough however it has been reported that only 438 of patients present with fever on admission radiologic abnormalities were not observed on initial presentation in approximately 20 of cases7 according to the sixth edition of the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan severe cases should meet any of the following criteria 1 shortness of breath respiratory rate 30 breaths per min 2 oxygen saturation 93 at rest or 3 arterial partial pressure of oxygenfraction of inspired oxygen  300 mm hg8 a small percentage of patients present with severe disease before or during hospitalization including severe pneumonia adult respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ failure which are associated with worse outcomes911 as of february 15 2020 the mortality rate and percentage of severe cases in hubei province were 26 and 152 respectively11 12 therefore specific predictive methods are urgently required to predict the risk of severe covid-199 of all existing models nomogram allows for individualized and evidence-based risk estimation facilitating management-based decision-making13 14 to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have evaluated early warning models for predicting the risk of severe covid-19previous studies have shown that there are significant regional differences in the mortality rate and percentage of severe cases12 15 the aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics of confirmed cases of covid-19 in sichuan china and construct an early warning prediction nomogram model incorporating clinical characteristics to identify the risk of developing severe covid-19this retrospective multicenter study included consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of covid-19 in sichuan china reported by the national health commission between january 20 2019 and february 8 2020 the data cutoff for the study was february 22 2020 covid-19 was confirmed by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract16 all study patients were diagnosed with covid-19 according to the who interim guidance17 the study was approved by the research ethics committee of west china hospital and data were collected retrospectively after patients gave written informed consentthe following data were obtained from electronic medical records demographics age and gender clinical signs on admission clinical symptoms clinical risk factors and exposure to infection clinical symptoms were defined as the interval between the onset of clinical symptoms and the data of admission exposure to infection was defined as contact with sources of infection in the past 14 days including wuhan or other covid-19 affected areas febrile patients or covid-19 patients and the incidence had clustering phenomenon the risk of exposure to infection changed as the relevant definitions in the covid-19 guidelines of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china changed national early warning score news18 was calculated on admission if data were missing from the records or clarification was needed data were obtained by direct communication with attending physicians and other health care providers all data were analyzed by two physicians he yq and zhou yw and a third researcher was consulted in cases of disagreement the clinical and demographic features in our cohort are summarized in table 1the primary outcome was severe covid-19 during hospitalization according to the american thoracic society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia19 severe cases should meet one major criterion septic shock with need for vasopressors or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or at least three minor criteria respiratory rate 30 breaths per min arterial partial oxygen pressurefraction of inspired oxygen 250 mmhg multilobar infiltrates confusiondisorientation uremia blood urea nitrogen level 20

analyses were performed using r software version 351 r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria and spss version 250 ibm corporation armonk ny continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range categorical variables were expressed as absolute values and percentages the means of continuous variables were compared using independent group t-tests for normally distributed data and the mann-whitney test for non-normally distributed data the 2 or fishers exact test was used to compare proportionsthe least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso method which is suitable for analyzing high-dimensional data was used to select the most significant predictive features20 21 features with non-zero coefficients in the lasso regression model were selected in the forward stepwise logistic regression model22 the features were considered as odds ratio or with 95 confidence interval 23 and two-tailed p-values variables with p-values smaller than 01 in the univariate analysis and potentially significant in the multivariate analysis were included in the logistic regression analysis and the forward selection procedure was used to develop a parsimonious model for predicting severe covid-19 in our cohortnomogram is a statistical model useful for risk assessment a predictive nomogram was developed using the independent factors selected by lasso to generate a combined indicator for estimating the severity of covid-19 and provided a quantitative tool for physicians to assess the individual probability of disease severity the created nomogram was used for internal validation and the total score for each nodule was calculated the nomogram was constructed using the total score as a factor adequate discrimination and calibration were performed to test and validate the prognostic accuracy of the nomogram model24 discrimination was quantified using harrells concordance index c-index in which an absolute value close to 1 indicated that the model had strong predictive ability the nomogram was further validated by bootstrapping 1000 bootstrap replicates to calculate the corrected c-index calibration plots were developed to assess the predictive accuracy and agreement between predicted and observed severity decision curve analyses dcas were performed to assess the clinical usefulness of the nomogram the net benefit was calculated by subtracting the proportion of patients with false-positive results from the proportion of patients with true-positive results and by weighing the relative risk of an intervention compared with the adverse effects of an unnecessary intervention the precision of the predictions was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve auc two-sided p-values of less than 005 were considered to indicate a statistically significant differencea total of 366 patients with covid-19 who had been hospitalized in 47 regions of sichuan were enrolled until january 20 2020 most patients were admitted to a public health clinical center located in chengdu the demographic and clinical characteristics of our cohort are shown in table 1 the median age was 43 years interquartile range 318510 and 566 were male fever occurred in 429 of patients from the earliest onset of symptom and in 295 on admission the second most common symptom was cough 314 digestive symptoms including vomiting and diarrhea were present in 74 of cases in our cohort 259 had at least one coexisting disease hypertension diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasedisease severity was considered mild in 323 patients and severe in 43 patients patients with severe disease were older than those with mild disease by a median of 6 years more than 50 of severe patients had systolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmhg moreover fever cough and dyspnea were more common in patients with severe disease than those with mild disease 581 vs 409 698 vs 263 and 279 vs 34 respectively comorbidities were more prevalent in severe patients than mild patients including hypertension 326 vs 74 cardiovascular disease 163 vs 06 diabetes 140 vs 46 chronic liver disease 93 vs 12 and chronic kidney disease 70 vs 03 more than 37 of severe patients had visited wuhan or other covid-affected areas in the past 14 days however the history of contact with febrile or covid-19 patients was similar between the two groupsbased on demographics clinical signs on admission clinical symptoms clinical risk factors and exposure to infection seven potential predictors with non-zero coefficients were selected in the lasso logistic regression model fig 1a and 1bthe selected predictors were body temperature on admission cough dyspnea hypertension cardiovascular disease chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease the results of the logistic regression analysis are shown in table 2the nomogram used for predicting severe covid-19 was formulated using significant independent factors including body temperature at admission cough dyspnea hypertension cardiovascular disease chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease the nomogram showed that the best predictor of severity was comorbidity including chronic kidney disease cardiovascular disease and chronic liver disease each variable was assigned a score according to the demographic and clinical characteristics of each patient and the total score was computed by summing individual scores patient severity probabilities were also obtained from the nomogram fig 2the c-index of the nomogram was 0863 95 ci 08010925 in our model and 0839 by bootstrapping analysis suggesting that the model had good discriminative ability the calibration plots of the nomogram showed that the agreement between predicted and observed severity was optimal fig 3a in addition dca showed that the predictive model had significant net benefits for almost all threshold probabilities at different time points demonstrating the potential clinical benefit of the predictive model fig 3b the auc of the nomogram was 0862 indicating improved survival prediction compared with the nomogram model fig 3cwe developed and validated a prediction nomogram based on clinical features to identify patients who might develop severe disease the nomogram included vital signs symptoms and comorbidities and showed good discrimination and calibration our model is useful to predict severe covid-19 traditional evaluation scoring tools including news qsofa and curb-65 are adopted to assess disease severity in emergency departments23 25 26 however there is no evidence that these tools are useful for the early assessment of covid-19 severity compared with other diseases covid-19 progresses faster and severity cannot be identified promptly the early symptoms of covid-19 are more insidious the disease progresses faster and early detection is challenging therefore our nomogram is a convenient and valuable clinical tool for predicting severe covid-19previous studies have shown that age is an important independent prognostic factor in patients with severe infection diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 20 26 it has been demonstrated that prognosis in older covid-19 patients especially those aged 65 years was worse than in younger patients 1 5 in our study the severe group was older than the non-severe group however age was not an independent predictive factor for severe diseaseunderlying diseases are more prevalent in severe covid-19 patients than in mild patients and the most common comorbidities are hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease11 27 in the univariate analysis hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with underlying diseases ie diabetes and coronary heart disease than in patients without these comorbidities to the best of our knowledge no other studies have evaluated the relationship between underlying diseases and covid-19 severity our study found that chronic cardiovascular disease hypertension kidney disease and liver disease were risk factors for the development of severe illnesscovid-19 impairs the function of multiple organs including the heart liver and kidneys existing research suggests that angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 may be a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 entry into human cells and the virus may increase pulmonary vascular permeability and induce acute lung injury by down-regulating ace2 expression and increasing angiotensin ii levels2830 ace2 receptors are highly expressed in cells of the bronchial epithelium alveoli type 2 cells myocardium renal proximal tubule epithelium bladder epithelium esophagus and ileum suggesting that sars-cov-2 infection not only affects the respiratory system but may also affect the circulatory urinary and digestive systems31 severe patients have multiple organ damage potentially leading to multiple organ failure however additional studies are needed to confirm that patients with underlying diseases ie cardiovascular disease or kidney disease infected with sars-cov-2 will accelerate this series of processes and their underlying mechanismsin the early stages of covid-19 the diversity of symptoms and imaging manifestations limit diagnosis3234 fever and cough are common and gastrointestinal symptoms are rare in covid-1935 no fever is more common than sars and mers in patients with early stage covid-1911 therefore patients without fever may be undiagnosed this study found that body temperature higher than 373c was not a risk factor in covid-19 and patients without fever in the early stage of the disease had a higher risk of developing severe conditions the reason is that fever may encourage the patient to seek medical treatment promptly allowing early disease detection and implementation of medical interventions in addition fever can inhibit the reproduction or growth of the virus however this process is complex and the effect of fever on this parameter should be better investigatedthe clinical data obtained on admission are included in the covid-19 early warning system which is simple practical reliable and fast this system was used to assess the risk of developing critical illness in the emergency department and allows medical staff to intervene at an early stage and determine their treatment location and the type of intervention this system is more practical to evaluate covid-19 patients than other scoring toolsour study has some limitations first the design was retrospective second some cases had incomplete data on symptoms laboratory tests and imaging examinations given the variation in the structure of electronic databases across different participating hospitals and an urgent data extraction schedule third some patients were not discharged during the study period and final prognosis could not be determined fourth the model verification method used internal random verification fifth although the auc was high 0863 and 95 ci was adequate 08010925 the number of severe cases was small therefore future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate our results sixth severe patients were older than non-severe patients and this difference in age may be a confounding factor seventh although the study is multicenter the results cannot be generalized to other populationswe established an early warning model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on hospital admission this model can be conveniently used to facilitate the predict the individual risk of severe covid-19 and help identify patients who might develop severe disease at early stage with conveniencein late december 2019 an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 began in wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the world 1 the world health organization declared the 2019 coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic on march 11 2020 and as of april 2 2020 a total of 1002159 cases were confirmed worldwide with 51485 deaths 2 the first confirmed imported case of covid-19 was detected in spain in la gomera canary islands on january 31 2020 2 since then and up to april 2 2020 a total of 110286 cases have been confirmed in spain including 10096 deaths 2 on march 17 2020 the first case of covid-19 was confirmed at the hospital nacional de parapljicos hnp in toledo spain a 212-bed national spinal cord injury sci monographic hospital classified as a long-term healthcare facility dedicated to the comprehensive rehabilitation of people with acute sci as well as people with chronic sci with multiple comorbidities the source of the first patients infection was close contact with their relative who was also later diagnosed with covid-19 since then despite having isolated the infected patient in the hospital and the use of personal protective equipment against infection by both the healthcare workers and the noninfected patients in quarantine it was inevitable that new cases of infection were also detected among patients with up to a total of seven currently confirmed as of april 7 2020sci involves multiple neurological and systemic complications which drastically interfere with the quality of life and life expectancy 3 several demographic and clinical factors associated with the more aggressive covid-19 phenotype have been identified male gender age over 60 years and the presence of previous comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes mellitus obesity cardiac ischemic disease lung disease and immunosuppression 4 it is reasonable to assume sci as a high-risk comorbidity mostly due to the presence of respiratory failure as a result of thoracoabdominal muscle weakness 5 and also because of systemic immunosuppression due to injury 6 7 suppression of the immune system after sci is due to noradrenergic overactivation and excess glucocorticoid release via hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis stimulation 8 and also to autoimmunity 9 both phenomena respiratory failure and injury-induced immunosuppression are more pronounced after cervical or high-thoracic compared with low-thoracic sci level which explains why pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in sci patients 10 as covid-19 is a novel viral respiratory infection its epidemiology and clinical course among people with sci are yet unknown however recently the first survey has been published which addresses covid-19-related practices and adaptations among health care professionals working with individuals with sci 11 so far only one case of covid-19 infection with sci has been reported 12 considering all the secondary complications associated with sci it is reasonable to expect a harsh prognosis with covid-19 infectionin the present study the authors aimed to describe the clinical features of the cohort of hospitalized sci cases with confirmed covid-19 infection in a monographic hospital in spain information which is especially important for a more accurate diagnosis and to prevent future outbreaksan observational prospective analysis was made of an sci patient cohort with confirmed covid-19 infection from march 20 up to april 4 2020 all of whom had been previously admitted for clinical care at the national sci monographic hospital in spain all of the patients had attended an inpatient treatment regime during the present sars-cov2 pandemic those patients in whom this infection could not be confirmed were excludedthe following demographic variables were recorded in the cohort age sex sci etiology neurological level and severity with the last two variables assessed in accordance with the international standards for neurological classification of sci 13the main sources of data were the electronic medical records and clinical reports of each patient data were recorded from the history of recent physical contacts made between the confirmed case the diagnostic time delay until reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr confirmation symptom and signs assessed at onset and evolution and the laboratory and chest x-rays in order to avoid bias and to ensure the patients data confidentiality all documents were handled after removing personal or identifying datacovid-19 diagnostic confirmation was defined as a positive result detected using the polymerase chain reaction with rt-pcr of nasal exudate or sputum samples according to the spanish ministry of health and the castilla la mancha government action procedures for cases of infection of the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 14 a recent physical contact exposure was defined as a close contact with a family member caregiver or healthcare professional diagnosed with covid-19fever was defined as a temperature higher than 375 c lymphocytopenia was defined as a lymphocyte count of 1500 cells per mm3 thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count of 150000mm3 pneumonia was defined based on the radiological report by a hospital radiologist classified either as normal with consolidation in only one lobe bilateral multilobular or with a ground glass pattern in addition the presence of atelectasis and or pleural effusion was recorded 15 laboratory tests included complete chemical analysis including liver and kidney function assessment electrolytes c-reactive protein lactate dehydrogenase ldh ferritin and blood countthe covid-19 severity was defined using the modified early warning system mews 16 a non-severe covid-19 case was defined by an mews score  2 a severe covid-19 case was defined by an mews score  2 but 5 a critical covid-19 case was defined by an mews score  5 in the case of pneumonia we included the curb-65 score 17data were expressed as mean or median  standard deviation as well as a percentage as it is a case series with only seven patients included further statistical analysis was not performedthe clinical profile of the cohort is shown in table 1 the majority were male five out of seven 714 with an average age of 68 years interquartile range 3475 a total of five out of seven patients 714 of the cohort presented with a cervical sci that was sensorimotor complete ais a in four out of seven cases 571 a subacute sci was present in more than half of the patients four out of seven with 3 months time from injury with respect to the sci etiology four of the cases were traumatic two of them were vascular and one of them was iatrogenic a total of four of the cases had a tracheostomy and two of them required frequent aspirations to remove respiratory secretions before covid-19 infection four patients had a history of risk factors such as hypertension four out of seven 571 dyslipidemia four out of seven 571 obesity three out of seven 429 and diabetes mellitus one out of seven 143 finally three of the patients 429 were either current or previous smokers and lung disease had been previously describedthe median diagnostic time delay defined as the time period from the onset of symptoms to confirmed covid-19 infection with rt-pcr was 4 days interquartile range 110 and was 6 days in six out of seven 857 of the cases fever was presented in six out of seven 857 of the patients at the time of diagnosis confirmation the second most common symptom was asthenia four out of seven 571 followed by dyspnea cough and expectoration three out of seven 429 for each symptom neurological two out of seven 286 and gastrointestinal one out of seven 143 symptoms were less common only two of the patients 286 presented one single symptom from onset while other two cases presented two symptoms and three with three or more symptomsthe mews score confirmed that covid-19s infection was severe in five out of seven of the patients 714 a total of three patients required oxygen therapy which was always applied at a low flow 3 lmin to achieve 98 oxygen saturation in the capillary oximetry continuous measurecovid-19 infection was confirmed with rt-pcr in all the cases laboratory tests results and radiological results are shown in table 2 lymphocytopenia was found in five out of seven of the patients 714 but only one of them showed thrombocytopenia unfortunately ferritin values were only available in four out of seven of the cases of which two presented normal values and the other two showed slightly elevated levels below 1000 ngml none of our patients showed altered levels of alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase and ldhwith respect to the radiographic findings two out of seven of our patients showed no radiological alterations at diagnosis fig 1a three out of seven of them presented bilateral multilobular pneumonia fig 1b one with unilobular pneumonia fig 1c and another one with a ground glass pattern fig 1d only one case showed pleural effusion fig 1call of the patients have been gradually recovering although the evolution was slower in the older patients who were also dependent on tracheostomy and suffered cervical ais a sci no deaths were recordedto the authors knowledge this is the first work that describes the clinical profile of covid-19 in a cohort of sci patients the vulnerability of people with sci is well known 510 we have found that more than half of our patients showed one or two symptoms at the moment of covid-19 confirmation which is lower than the symptomatic expression in other published case series 18 we hypothesized that the covid-19 symptoms overlapped with some of the signs of respiratory failure due to sci which would have complicated the accurate clinical diagnosis the average time delay between diagnosis in our case series was shorter than that found in other series which may reflect rapid early identification of the initial covid-19 symptoms in a cohort of hospitalized patients who were already receiving close attention for their sci at the onset of covid-19 infection fever and asthenia were the most frequently observed symptoms which slightly differed from other published series that identified cough and fever as initial symptoms in the general population 1820 we agree with the previous case of covid-19 sci in a patient with sci which reported that cough was not the prevalent symptom 12 however despite the less evident symptomatology in our cohort the mews score confirmed that they presented a higher risk of clinical worsening compared with the general population 18 before the clinical onset of covid-19 infection only half of the patients had a tracheostomy which required bronchial aspiration and hyperinflation techniques to remove respiratory secretions in contrast after covid-19 diagnosis all of the patients required such techniques in other studies a similar progression in the requirement for respiratory assistance has also been observed for patients who require oxygen therapy 1820 with 98 capillary oxygen saturation achieved with low flow oxygen therapy 3 lmin to date none of the patients with sci and covid-19 infection have required mechanical ventilation support or intensive care admissionin agreement with most of the published studies all of the covid-19 cases were confirmed with rt-pcr the radiological findings also agreed with the published data for covid-19 infection with the presentation of bilateral multilobe pneumonia as the most frequent radiological pattern in addition two-thirds of our cases also presented lymphocytopenia 3 18 20 however we did not find any alteration of transaminases or ldh levels serum ferritin values were obtained in almost all the patients with only half of them showing moderately elevated levels 1000 ngml these results may highlight a decreased inflammatory response in our series compared with the general population 4 20 and could be consistent with a more benign evolution of covid-19 infection for people with sciwe consider it of vital importance to closely supervise the sci population to identify early compatible covid-19 symptoms and signs as well as to implement follow-up measures against infectious diseases contagion these measures will be especially needed in long-term treatment facilities such as our hospital where asymptomatic cases could become covid-19 reservoirs further complicating the eradication of the current epidemic or future outbreaksthe limitations of this study include the fact that none of the patients admitted to the hnp or their healthcare personnel were interviewed for symptoms of infection or received the sars-cov-2 screening test which therefore may have led to an underestimation of the covid-19 infection rate in the hospital especially in those patients who were asymptomatic or who presented mild symptomsas this is a descriptive case series study there is no control group the absence of which is justified given the urgency of pandemic and the lack of previous covid-19 data among sci population unfortunately it is likely that our covid-19 sci case series will gradually increase until the end of the present pandemic which will provide us with more clinical data with longer evolution timesin our case series patients with sci and confirmed covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population furthermore although they presented a similar or greater mews severity the clinical evolution of covid-19 infection was not as pronounced as had been expected this study recommends close active supervision of the sci population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of covid-19 infectionsevere acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus strain that causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has been reported in several countries across continents since it was first identified in december 2019 it infected nearly 17 million people within four months 1 the virus first appeared in a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in wuhan china possibly related to a seafood market on january 12 2020 the virus was initially named the 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by the world health organization who from the discovery of the initial case in wuhan it rapidly spread across china and many other countries eventually affecting several continents on january 30 2020 the who officially declared the covid-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern on february 11 2020 the disease was officially named covid-19 by the who and the virus was named sars-cov-2 by the coronavirus study group of the international committee 2sars-cov-2 is a 125nm-diameter spherical-shaped -coronavirus other zoonotic -coronaviruses subsets are known to cause middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the nucleocapsid encloses a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus coronaviruses have four main structural proteins spike protein s membrane protein m envelope protein e and nucleocapsid n while -coronavirus contains a fifth structural protein hemagglutinin-esterase he which is analogous to hemagglutinin 3epidemiologythe median incubation period of the infection is 51 days with 975 of the population showing symptoms within 12 days of exposure 4 the basic reproduction number r0 which is the indicator of the transmissibility of the disease was derived from the mean of 12 studies between december 2019 to january 2020 and is 328 with a median of 279 range 14-649 5 however this number is still evolving with a most recent study from the centers for disease control and prevention reporting a median r0 as high as 57 95 ci 38-89 based on the assumed serial interval six to nine days 6 the case fatality rate cfr of sars-cov-2 infection ranges widely between countries from 72 in italy to 07 in south korea due to numerous factors 78 however these numbers are subject to change in the future as during an epidemic studies only capture a cross-sectionaltemporal representation at the time of assessment more reflective values can be obtained once the epidemic is over as the number of disease cases changes rapidly conducting a precise epidemiological study is challenginggeneticsthe complete reference genome sequence data of sars-cov-2 was made available in december 2019 and the sequence data and variations have been updated at genbank 9 sars-cov-2 is 962 identical to a bat cov ratg13 and shares 795 of its identity with sars-cov suggesting the bat as the most likely natural host of the virus however it is suspected that the zoonotic infection took place via an unknown intermediate host 2pathogenesisviral attachment and entrythe molecular protein responsible for the entry of sars-cov-2 into human host cells is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 10 this protein is widely found in different organs such as the lung kidney heart and endothelial tissue the main functions of ace2 are the downregulation of the renin-angiotensin-system ras balancing the overdrive of ras mediated response and the renal gastrointestinal absorption of amino acids 11 it also acts as a means of clathrin-mediated internalization of viruses such as sars coronavirus 11 recent studies have revealed that ace2 interacts with transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 which is responsible for the s protein activation of sars-cov-2 just as in sars coronavirus 31012 s protein of the viral structure interacts with surface ace2 enzyme which leads to the internalization of the viral material as the viral rna is released into the host cytoplasm the viral translation process takes place using the host cellular machinery 10protein synthesis and viral replicationthe viral replicase gene of the single-stranded rna is translated to produce key proteins such as rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp rna helicase and other non-structural proteins which will serve as replicase-transcriptase complex rtc 313 further to rtc translation subsequent viral rna synthesis takes place using rdrp through a complementary strand as an intermediate the translation products of the viral sub-genomic rna are further processed and this results in a series of viral structural s e n and m proteins they are subsequently used in the assembly process with viral genomic rna which is then released 3general viral infection and immune responseupon viral infection the immune system responds mainly in three ways at the early phase of the infection an innate immune response deploys myeloid lineage cells natural killer nk cells and epithelial cells which upon activation will secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors these include but not limited to interleukins il -1 -6 -8 -12 -15 -18 tumor necrosis factors tnf granulocyte-macrophage gm- granulocyte g- macrophage colony-stimulating factors m-csf and interferon-gamma ifn- 1 2 3 these cytokines act to induce specific cells including nk and dendritic cells 14 dendritic cells of the respiratory system can be directly and indirectly activated upon viral respiratory infection epithelial cells release il-1 and then gm-csf to recruit dendritic cells and secrete il-33 to support paracrine regeneration 14 in the lung type ii pneumocytes t2p also participate during the immune response t2p produces surfactant which is composed of phospholipids mainly phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol lipid cholesterol and surfactant protein a b c d the surfactant a and d pair with viruses to promote the action of macrophages 15 an effective early phase defense mechanism depends on phagocytic cell interaction with antigens directly using pattern recognition receptors prr and pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamp or indirectly via opsonins the adaptive immune response especially the arm of t cell maturation is in majority through an increase in il-2 followed later by a cd4th cell response and cd8t-cell-mediated cytotoxic response through the process of autophagy harmful and damaged cellular components are metabolically degraded 16 autophagy also plays an important role in modulating the innate and adaptive responses during a viral infection as any pathogenetic steps of viral infection from its entry fusion and to the interference of cellular homeostasis can disrupt the immune-protective mechanism 16sars-cov-2 infection and its possible pathophysiology and the immune responsea similar early innate response is seen in sars-cov-2-infected patients who present with initial cardinal symptoms such as fever and malaise yet their clinical sequelae and the response to the treatment are different from any respiratory diseases known today the increase in the body temperature seems to be due to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 -6 -8 -10 -12 and tnfs from first responders such as monocytes damaged local endothelial cells and neutrophils while macrophages promote the local inflammatory response with the release of chemotactic factors the paracrine response of the endothelial cells and pneumocytes enhances the expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 icam-1 on t2p e-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule vcam facilitate the migration of white blood cellsit is suspected that the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards-like picture in sars-cov-2-infected patients is precipitated and worsened by the excess monocytes in response to gm-csf which is released by rapidly activated cd4t-cell lineage 17 the progression to ards-like presentation is driven by three main factors the local inflammatory response by neutrophils inducing local damage the releasing of proteinaceous cellular debris in the alveolar space and locally-acting mediators such as endothelin-1 phospholipase a-2 and angiotensin-2 making the local vessel more permeable the damage to type i pneumocytes impedes local gas exchange while damage to type ii pneumocytes results in decreased surfactant production the surfactant has an important function in reducing the surface tension of alveoli as more t2p are lost the surface tension of the alveoli increases which leads to the collapse of the alveolar cavity furthermore the alveolar cavity is filled with the proteinaceous cellular debris from the inflammatory reactions and the exudate from the increase in vascular permeability which translates into the pulmonary edema-like picture in patients the infection spreads to the adjacent alveoli through the pores of kohn infecting adjacent alveolar cavities these events explain the progression of lung involvement dyspnea and shortness of breath yet ards-like presentation with sars-cov-2 infection is atypical as the patients who fit into the berlin definition do not show similar lung compliance and shunt fraction as a typical ards patient 18cytokine stormsars-cov-2-infected patients have shown a rise of cytokines during their disease course notably il-2 -4 -6 -7 -10 tnf- g-csf interferon-gamma-inducible protein ip monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mcp1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip1a between day 3-10 of disease onset which corresponded to the disease severity of the patients 171920 patients with mild symptoms presented with an elevation of cytokines within the reference ranges while severe patients showed markedly elevated levels 19 as for the ifn- there are mixed findings 1921 zhou et al have considered the high ifn- and gm-csf by th1 cells and gm-csf by cd8t-cells as the possible cause of the hyper-inflammatory reaction as nk cells and b-cells were not found to relate with these features 21 given that monocytes respond to gm-csf as expected sars-cov-2-infected patients had higher cd14cd16 monocytes than normal healthy individuals 1721 these monocytes promote the secretion of gm-csf and il-6 both of which are surged in severely ill patients overfeeding the inflammatory response and suggesting the relationship among gm-csf il-6 monocytes and th1 cells which explains the cytokine storm 172021a recent study of sars-cov has shown that t-cell dysfunction along with the decrease in type i ifn is related to t-cell exhaustion 22 yet the relationship between the clinical severity of sars-cov-2-infected patients and t-cell exhaustion is still unknown mehta p et al have reported that the cytokine profile and the trend of the inflammatory markers of sars-cov-2-infected patients present similarly to the secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh whose severe clinical presentation is related to the cytokine storm 23 further study is needed to verify if the severe presentation and poor prognosis are related to any of these aforementioned findingsclinical presentationa spectrum of symptoms is observed in sars-cov-2-infected patients the degree of the severity of the disease experienced by a diverse population is very different as well while the majority of patients experience cardinal and respiratory symptoms a minority of the population also presents with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea nausea and vomiting the most commonly reported symptoms are fever dry cough and fatigue followed by myalgia chest tightnesspain sore throat shortness of breath dyspnea and rhinorrhea tables 1 2 1924-27liu et al have reported that the severity of atypical pneumonia correlated with an increase in different criteria such as sequential organ failure assessment sofa acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation ii apache ii and curb 65 the acronym for criterion assessing the risk of patients presenting with respiratory diseases 24 wang et als study found a similar tendency among sars-cov-2-infected patients 25 the progression of atypical pneumonia and respiratory failure were reported as sequelae of this disease with other severe complications such as multiple organ failure sepsis and death the correlation may suggest poor prognosis however a meta-analysis is required to support this the level of il-6 is also suggested as being associated with a severe presentation of respiratory symptoms possibly related to the cytokine storm 2428 in addition onder et al have shown a significant case fatality in relation to the increase in the age of patients 7on the other side of the spectrum although uncommon neurological symptoms have been reported suggesting neurologic deficits can be associated with sars-cov-2 infection zhao et al have reported a case of a possible association with guillain-barr syndrome gbs where a 61-year-old woman acutely developed symmetric lower extremity weakness eight days before the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms 29 another case a post-infectious acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy was reported in a patient who had a three-day history of altered mental status with cough and fever 30 however it is difficult to conclude if sars-cov-2 infection is associated with these specific diagnoses added based simply on two individual case reports more data and studies are needed to elucidate this relationship and risk populationdiagnostic studiesclinical diagnosisthere is no identified pathognomonic clinical presentation of sars-cov-2 infection at the initial phase of the epidemic high clinical suspicion was related to the presence of fever malaise respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms along with a recent travel history to wuhan china or physical contact with people at high risk which were used to determine if further investigations were indicated as the pandemic progressed and the chains of spreads took root within many local communities more emphasis was put on the importance of diagnostic studies rather than clinical presentation wang et al have stratified the sars-cov-2-infected patients presentation according to the symptom severity table 3 31laboratory diagnosismany non-specific inflammatory markers including c-reactive protein crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and ferritin are elevated in sars-cov-2-infected patients 2531 other laboratory findings include elevated procalcitonin decreased total lymphocytes count prolonged prothrombin time ptt elevated d-dimer alanine transaminase alt aspartate transaminase ast blood urea nitrogen bun creatinine cr lactate dehydrogenase ldh and creatine kinase ck which were generally found to be more pronounced in patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu 25 patients in the icu had high levels of cytokines such as il -2 -7 -10 tnf-  g-csf and mip1a 20 critically ill patients and non-survivors had high levels of neutrophils d-dimer ferritin bun and cr suggesting a possible pathological etiology related to a poor prognosis 25laboratory tests for diagnosing sars-cov-2 include nucleic acid amplification tests naat such as real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr serological testing such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and viral sequencing 32 each diagnostic method has its own advantages and disadvantages currently rt-pcr is most favored for its practicality time efficiency and cost factor 31imaging studiesradiographic features are usually absent in mild cases of sars-cov-2 infection common early-stage ct findings up to day four after symptom onset have shown numerous focal ground-glass opacities in the majority of patients 33 between day 5-13 lung involvement worsened with increasing consolidation in several lobes of both lungs these pulmonary pathologies started to improve after day 14 but a complete resolution was hardly achieved even after 25 days 33 other manifestations included vascular thickening halo- or air bronchogram sign and pleural effusion although these have been rarely encountered 3133 ultrasound us images have supported ct findings confirming thickened pleural lines and the location of lesions 3134 us shows b lines in the early stage and in mild infections with the alveolar interstitial syndrome as the disease progresses 34current research and evidencetreatment optionsthere is no consensus yet on how to treat sars-cov-2-infected patients who present with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and severity the current use of hydroxychloroquine is based on the knowledge of minimizing the viral entry into the host cell and impeding viral replication by disrupting the assembly and release of the virus 35 mukherjee et al have reported a favorable outcome in a 49-year-old patient who had multifocal atypical pneumonia and treated with hydroxychloroquine 26 a recent non-randomized clinical trial in france without a control group has shown a positive result of the use of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin in sars-cov-2-infected patients leading to a faster resolution of symptoms in the majority of patients 36 an adenosine analog remdesivir gs5734 acts as a nucleotide analog that halts the transcription process of viral rna 37 holshue et al have reported successful treatment with remdesivir of the first sars-cov-2-infected patient in the united states 27 wang et al have reported positive effects of remdesivir and chloroquine in a study using infected cells 38 however not all studies are in favor of the use of these drugs a small pilot study of 30 patients in china found no statistically significant difference in the remission of the disease between the hydroxychloroquine treatment group and the control 39 lopinavir and ritonavir novel protease inhibitors that are used to treat hiv infection are other medications proposed to treat sars-cov-2 infection cao et al found through a randomized controlled trial of 199 patients that the lopinavir-ritonavir treated group did not show a statistically significant difference in the mortality hazard ratio and viral load as compared to patients who had standard care 40 given that many antiviral treatments are related to severe side effect profiles a precautious determination of the right dosage and appropriate targets should be determined through clinical trialsvaccine developmentstructural proteins such as glycoprotein or spike protein are important targets of antiviral vaccine development given that the genomic sequence of the amino acid can be used for homology remodeling it may theoretically assist in identifying molecules with possible antiviral properties 41 yet the high potential of spontaneous mutation associated with the genetic properties of the coronavirus such as a high recombination ability and the presence of splicing sites and more than 40 rna modification sites may pose challenges to this as it can promote changes of target tissue specificity and antiviral sensitivity 42protease inhibitor targeting s spike proteinin addition to the presence of ace2 an important serine protease tmprss2 is used in s protein priming this process is shown to play an important role in viral entry by mediating viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane into the host cell and hence is related to infectivity 10 for this reason hoffmann et al proposed a serine tmprss2 protease inhibitor camostat mesylate for its potential benefit 10 however this needs further studies as sars another subset of coronavirus can enter host cells via an alternative pathway using endosome when the key proteases are lacking 12preventionwith the absence of a treatment of choice preventive measures are the most effective way to minimize the spread of infection the infection primarily spreads via respiratory secretions and droplets direct contact by touching contaminated surfaces andor indirectly via fomites transmission can occur from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients before symptom onset infected droplets can spread 1-2 m and can deposit on surfaces where they remain for a period of time the degeneration of infectious material is accelerated by common disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide some studies have also indicated this virus to be present in stool and contaminated water supplies suggesting possible transmission via the fecal-oral route 43 currently preventive measures include the appropriate use of personal protective equipment ppe social distancing and hand-washingdiscussionit is hard to predict where this infection can lead with a relatively high number of reproducibility a long incubation period and possible transmissibility even during an asymptomatic period sars-cov-2 has infected over 169 million people worldwide as of april 12 2020 less than four months after its first identification at the end of december 2019 1 being an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna virus its mutation rate is higher than the dna counterparts that use host replication machinery as the number of infected people increases different selection pressures can derive an emergence of variant strain andor the survival of the fittest tang et al have reported two different strains of sars-cov-2 l and s subtypes with s subtype being the ancestral one however the progenic l subtype presents higher transmissibility 44 in addition a recent chinese case report has described a patient shedding virus for 49 days which is unusually longer as compared to the median duration of 20 days 45 this suggests that the variation of genotype is still emerging and that mutations can occur anytime in the futurethe pathophysiology behind the peripheral leukopenia in severe patients is not fully understood many viruses are known to interfere with t-cell activation maturation or programmed cell death recent research has shown that mers-cov another coronavirus acts to promote the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of t-cell apoptosis thereby decreasing the t-cell population 46 cd4t-cells are crucial in promoting humoral immunity and b-cell activation the loss of th1 th2 and th17 populations implies a decrease in the efficacy of mounting the adaptive immune response interestingly the patient population who had severe symptomatic presentation showed more pronounced leukopenia especially during the early phase four to six days after disease onset of the disease course with an increase in cytokines original research article liu j li s liu j et al longitudinal characteristics of lymphocyte responses and cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood of sars-cov-2 infected patients 2020 zheng et al have proposed that this may be due to the functional exhaustion of t-cells 47 and zhou et al have identified the high expression of both t-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 tim-3 and programmed cell death-1 pd-1 to support this idea 21 more studies are needed in the future to elucidate the pathogenesis behind the peripheral cytopenia and immune dysregulationa minority of patients on remission presented back with clinical symptoms of the disease relapse or reactivation between 4-17 days after discharge 48 chen et al have reported a case of recurrence of viral rna after two consecutive days of negative tests 49 ye et al have reported a rate of reactivation as high as 9 in their study but their patients clinical presentation was not as critical as the initial infection 48 the reactivations were confirmed using positive rt-pcr the study suggested that the reactivation is associated with the degree of the immune status of the patients the genotypic factor of the virus and the baseline viral load it also pointed out that all patients with reactivations were treated with antiviral medication such as oseltamivir or arbidol 48 although the clinical presentation and sequelae are not as severe in the patients with reactivation there is still a risk of droplet-transmission to others upon discharge and hence can pose a public health concern if ignored it will be necessary to educate the patients on the possibility of reactivation and encourage a 14-day self-isolation to minimize contact with others while reporting to the appropriate healthcare agency if symptoms recursars-cov-2 infection or covid-19 is a highly transmissible novel zoonotic infection with high case fatality rates the transmission of infection from both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and its relatively long incubation period make it even harder to control its spread unfortunately there is no consensus on how to treat this infectious disease yet more studies and data are needed a good understanding of the disease transmission its genetics pathophysiology clinical presentation prognostic factors diagnostic studies and preventive measures are of prime importance in making clinical decisions and designing research projects for best treatment while responding to minimize the threat to peopleon december 31 2019 the world health organization who learned of several cases of a respiratory illness clinically resembling viral pneumonia and manifesting as fever cough and shortness of breath the newly discovered virus emerging from wuhan city hubei province of china has been temporarily named novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 1 this new coronavirus belongs to the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans being different from severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers 23 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is defined as illness caused by a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 4the outbreak is escalating quickly with thousands of confirmed covid-19 cases reported globally on january 30 the china reported the first confirmed instance of person-to-person spread of the virus 5 and then infections have been identified in other chinese cities besides several exported cases have been confirmed in other countries in thailand japan south korea and the usa 6 now the covid-19 has led to a world-wide pandemia which has affected also europe australia new zealand africa etc 7proven cases of covid-19 have been acquired both in the community and hospital setting the source of covid-19 is not yet clear but the origin of the infection has been associated with bat 8 covid-19 has been detected in healthy patients with or without known comorbidities before with a larger proportion of reported cases in this group patients with diabetes hypertension chronic renal failure cardiomyopathy decreased immunity and malignancy seem to be at a higher risk for developing severe disease 6 the current symptoms include cough fever dyspnea nausea and myalgia 9 severe cases of covid-19 may be admitted to intensive care and mechanical ventilation as we all know no specific antiviral agents are available against covid-19 at presenttherefore early disease recognition is important not only for prompt implementation of treatment but also for patient isolation and effective public health surveillance containment and response however limited information exists regarding chest imaging findings of covid-19 pneumonia a recent cohort study of 41 patients with confirmed covid-19 infection included limited analysis of chest radiographs 6 the aim of this study was to review and better describe the chest ct findings in patients with covid-19from jan 24 2020 to mar 5 2020 we reviewed a case series of chest ct scan from 34 patients infected with covid-19 to identify and characterize the most common findings all these cases

 there were 2434 7059 patients with a total of 127166 7651 lesions involving both lungs and 1734 5000 patients with 105166 6325 lesions involving 4 to 5 lobes 2934 8529 patients with 149166 8976 lesions distributed in the lung periphery fig 5
the 33 cases were cured except one death all cured patients were performed with ct scanning to confirm that the inflammation had disappeared or significantly decreased when they were cured and allowed to discharge nineteen patients underwent a second ct examination within 3 to 5 days as their symptoms worsened one of the nineteen patients 13 had normal initial and follow-up chest ct examinations with no interval change five of the 19 patients demonstrated mild progression fig 1 fig 3 and 8 patients demonstrated moderate progression and advanced from pure ggo to crazy-paving pattern fig 3 and appeared intralesional vacuole sign fig 4 an 88-year-old woman demonstrated severe progression and was died of respiratory failure 14 days later after being found going worse fig 3 the ct manifestations of 4 asymptomatic patients became worse after one week but they were also asymptomatic until they were cured the qualitative changes at follow-up ct examination in 19 patients were seen in table 4
a wide variety of ct findings in covid-19 were reported in several studies 1011 on initial one reported bilateral consolidation with peripheral distribution 2 a second report showed that bilateral ggo from one patient 1213 in two other large studies with 138 and 99 confirmed cases consolidative airspace opacities and ggo were the most commonly reported imaging features 114 in a prospective case series of 41 admitted patients ct abnormalities suggestive of ggo showed bilateral lung involvement 6 a different report mentioned less details on distribution or pattern besides ggo 5 in another study chung et al characterized the ct manifestations of covid-19 pneumonia in 21 patients and reported bilateral lung involvement in 76 and peripheral airspace opacities in one-third of the cases at presentation 3 more than half of their patients showed ggo without consolidative opacities whereas 29 showed ggo in addition to consolidative opacities at presentation in another study of 51 patients with confirmed covid-19 1324 lung lesions were detected on chest ct the most common ct findings seen in these patients were isolated ggo ggo with reticular or interlobular septal thickening and ggo in combination with consolidative opacities 15 air bronchograms were reported in 80 of these patients 16 in this retrospective case series we noted each had abnormalities present in their ct scans with the goal of familiarizing radiologists and clinical teams with identifying the radiological features of infected with the covid-19 of this new outbreak we found that ggo were typical ct findings with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution and ggo were more extensive than consolidation some additional features were observed such as air bronchogram and distribution of the changes in the peripheral parts of the lungs some patients were characteristically described as crazy-paving pattern of which the reticular network in it is thought to represent the thickened interlobular septa while the ggo reflect the alveolar filling with periodic acid-schiff-positive material the mechanisms thought to be responsible for this pattern include interstitial fibrotic processes alveolar filling processes or a combination of both 16 we also noted the number of lobes of the lungs that were affected with ground glass opacities and consolidation in the present study the fine reticular pattern was distinguished from crazy-paving pattern it is more uniform and of the same size this manifestation may be due to the dilation of the microvessels in the alveolar septa caused by early inflammation and further development tends to be a crazy paving pattern which means the thickened septa is more irregular sharper and denser intralesional vacuole sign was observed in 4 cases it may be the dilation of alveolar ducts and alveolar sac indicating the alveolar destruction and onset of fibrosispan et al reported the temporal course of ct changes in 21 confirmed cases of covid-19 in early stage the majority of their patients showed more ggo and a lower number of involved lobes compared with the later follow-up scans however intensification of a crazy paving pattern increase in the number of involved lobes and appearance of consolidative opacities occurred in most patients over time 17 pan et al assessed the follow-up ct scans of 63 patients that were obtained within 314 days after an initial ct study they found that more than 85 of the patients showed imaging signs associated with disease progression such as increase in ggo consolidative opacities and interstitial septal thickening 18 in our study nineteen patients underwent a second ct examination within three to five days as their symptoms worsened the lesions of 5 patients increased significantly and 8 patients advanced from pure ggo to crazy-paving pattern and appeared intralesional vacuole sign therefore the crazy-paving pattern and intralesional vacuole sign are the features of progressive stage thus ct examination is very important in evaluating the condition of patients under treatmentinterestingly not all patients showed any of these ct findings in their initial stages and these radiological findings might be absent we found that 1 of 34 patients had normal initial chest ct this shows that ct imaging may lack whole sensitivity and does not show a negative predictive value therefore we cant solely depend on ct to completely exclude presence of covid-19 the main reason is that covid-19 infection may take time to demonstrate as a disease prior to visible abnormalities on ct lung cavitation discrete pulmonary nodules and lymphadenopathy were not observed some of the patients also had underlying lung diseases such as fibrosis and emphysema these features were all recorded for the patients with the coronavirus infectionsthe 4 patients with no symptoms had typical ct findings of covid-19 in our study this suggests that ct examination is also important for those with an epidemiological history although there are no clinical symptoms the who suggested contact precautions when resolving suspected cases being infected with covid-19 17 timely identification of patients is needed for those patients who may present with unusual or mild symptoms or carry covid-19 not being recognized rrt-pcr testing yielding false-negative results 19 thus patients who were exposure or travel to areas of covid-19 outbreak and were with suggestive imaging findings may aid in early isolation generally the ct outcomes reported for covid-19 are resembling to those reported with mers-cov 2021 and sars-cov 2223 not surprised because the responsible virus is also coronavirus although we managed to radiologically observe the covid-19 infected individuals there are still many questions to be answered and further study is required to understand how patients fare after treatmentin summary this work represents an early investigation of ct findings in covid-19 the bilateral ggo with air bronchogram enlarged blood vessel fine reticular pattern and peripheral distribution are the early ct findings of covid-19 the crazy-paving pattern and intralesional vacuole sign are the features of progressive stage this is important for early diagnosis and assessment of disease progression furthermore normal finding of ct imaging does not exclude the potential infection of covid-19 ct examination is necessary to detect asymptomatic pneumonia especially in those with an epidemiological historyin december 2019 a series of acute respiratory diseases occurred in wuhan hubei province china now are called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 the disease has rapidly spread from wuhan to other regions as of february 25 2020 a total of 77785 covid-19 cases have been confirmed in china a new type of coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in wuhan city and then it confirmed as the pathogen of covid-19 a new type of coronavirus sars-cov-2 which was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in wuhan city was confirmed as the cause of covid-192 now the virus is renamed sars-cov-2 by who3 whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis indicate that sars-cov-2 is a unique clade of  -coronal viruses associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers2 like other  coronaviruses the genome of sars-cov-2 has a long orf1ab polyprotein at the 5 end followed by four major structural proteins including the spike surface glycoprotein small envelope protein matrix protein and nucleocapsid protein4 sars-cov-2 is very similar to coronavirus in bats which are presumed to be the main source5 although the origin of sars-cov-2 is still under investigation current evidence suggests that it spread to humans through wild animals sold illegally in the south chinahuang et al first reported 41 covid-19 cases most of whom had a history of exposure to the south china seafood wholesale market the patients clinical manifestations include fever dry cough dyspnea myalgia fatigue normal or decreased white blood cell count and imaging evidence of pneumonia7 however no difference in clinical characteristics have been reported between wuhan and other cities in china case reports confirm human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2
8 currently there is no effective first screening and diagnosis guide for covid-19 in non-wuhan areas therefore if the hunan hospital adopts clinical covid-19 diagnosis measures similar to hubei area it will often lead to a higher misdiagnosis rate because of the lighter early clinical symptoms slighter respiratory damage and the lower positive rate of imaging resultsthe purpose of this case series is to describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with sars-cov-2 infection in hunan china then compared with wuhansthis study was approved by the hospital ethics committee and all study participants were informed the study population consisted of 33 covid-19 patients at the second xiangya hospital of central south university hunan province china between to january to february 2020 aged 20 to 70 years all the patients were diagnosed by two experienced doctors we only show the patients who are positive for in viral nucleotide testing the samples from the participants were obtained before clinical intensive treatment participants received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded respiratory and stool samples were collected with the consent of all patients unless otherwise stated patients were sampled without gender or age bias swabs and stool were stored at -20 until usewhenever a commercial kit is used the manufacturers instructions should be followed without modification nucleic acids were extracted by ssnp-2000a automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument and nucleic acid extraction kits sansure biotech china 20 l extracted nucleic acid sample was added into a pcr amplification tube which contains 30 l of the prepared pcr-mixed solution detected through fluorescence quantitative pcr using a fluorescent pcr instrument amplification was performed as follows 50 for 30 minutes 95 for 60 seconds and then 40 cycles including 95 for 15 seconds 60 for 30 secondsthe primer and probe sequences9orf1b gene5-tggggytttacrggtaacct-3 forward5-aacrcgcttaacaaagcactc-3 reversen gene5-taatcagacaaggaactgatta-3 forward5-cgaaggtgtgacttccatg-3 reversewe reviewed the care records laboratory test results and chest x-rays and ct reports of laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infected patients admission data for these patients were from january 9 2020 to february 9 2020 the two researchers also independently reviewed data collection forms to confirm repeatedlycontinuous variables are expressed as median iqr and compared using the mann-whitney u test categorical variables are expressed as numbers  and compared by chi-square test or fishers exact test a two-sided  of less than 005 was considered statistically significant spss version 250 software spss inc chicago il usa was used to analyse the datasby feb 9 2020 33 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection in hunan the patients infected with sars-cov-2 were aged from 27 to 78 and the median age of the patients was 46 years iqr 315-65 as of feb 9 in our cohort of 33 patients no child was infected and no gender distribution in infected patients table 1
the clinical and laboratory data of patients in wuhan area originated from the article of huang c et al7 19 58 patients had hubei travel or residence history while 14 42 patients had contacted hubei personnel the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever 23 70 of 33 patients cough 13 39 and myalgia or fatigue 14 30 less common symptoms were sputum production 5 15 of 33 headache 2 6 of 33 and diarrhoea 5 15 of 33 most of patients had chest tightness 5 15 or shortness of breath 6 18 however few patients 0 0 of 33 developed dyspnoea by comparing the hunans data with wuhans the area with the most severe outbreak of covid-19 in china we found that the clinical symptoms of patients with sars-cov-2 infection in hunan were significantly different from those in wuhan the fever rate of newly diagnosed patients in hunan area is lower and the temperature of most patients is below 39  94 most patients with sars-cov-2 did not cough in the early stages of infection it is worth noting that patients with sars-cov-2 in hunan rarely have difficulty breathing at first diagnosis only with slight shortness of breath or chest tightness however more than half of patients 55 in wuhan suffer from dyspnea table 2

the blood counts of patients on admission showed lymphopenia lymphocyte count less than 1  10l 17 61 of 28 patients while the white blood cell count was usually normal 523  10l 195-2668 the level of d-dimer in hunans median d-dimer level 092 mgl 08-111 was higher than that in wuhans median d-dimer level 05 mgl 0313 levels of alanine amino transferase 2885 ul 2268-4125 and aspartate amino transferase 3095 ul 227-4253 in hunan showed no statistical significance with wuhans total bilirubin 7315 mmoll 7222-7918 was increased substantially in hunan patients uric acid 3489 mmoll 2688-4596 and blood urea nitrogen 413 moll 31-498 were dramatically changed in different patients the creatine kinase of hunan patients 1205ul 821-16575 manifested a smaller change compared to wuhan 1325 ul 6202190 and lactate dehydrogenase 2543 ul 21825-3158 was increased in the most patients these reminded the function of liver heart and kidney will be slightly damaged the serum levels of procalcitonin on admission of most patients is normal 0074 ngml 00445-009025 however patients usually manifested higher c-reactive protein 523 mgl 195-2668 mycoplasma pneumoniae igm did not rise in all patients and we also did not find cases of co-infection between influenza ab virus and sars-cov-2 cycle threshold of respiratory tract ct  3277 263369 and stool ct  3464 2859360 were below the reference value ct  37 table 2on admission abnormalities in chest ct images were detected among most patients the report of ct results of covid-19 patients in wuhan area originated from pan y et al10 of the 19 patients in hunan 6 316 did not show obvious abnormalities the typical findings of chest ct images of patients 6 316 were patchypunctate ground glass opacities fig 2
b only two patients ct images performed ground glass opacity patchy consolidation and fibrous stripes 105 fig 2a compared with patients in wuhan the pathological changes in the lungs of hunan patients were milder in ct 694 and chest radiographs 625 table 3
many patients with covid-19 in hunan region showed significant symptoms of diarrhea by testing nucleic acid levels in stool of these patients we found that the virus was present in both the respiratory tract and the stool of eight patients of these patients there is no statistical difference between cycle threshold of respiratory tract and stool p  0893 the expression amount of nucleic acid is not related to diarrhea p  0285 table 4
 however by testing nucleic acid levels in tears we found the virus in 6 patients respiratory tract while their tears were negative table 5
within weeks after the outbreak of the covid-19 china quickly developed a nucleic acid detection protocol for this virus this is the first time we have proposed a preliminary screening program for covid-19 patients in hunan we detected sars-cov-2 in oral swabs and stools because infected patients may release this pathogen through the respiratory tract feces or body fluidsthe white blood cell counts of most newly diagnosed patients with covid-19 in hunan area were normal even so he will be accompanied by significant decrease in lymphocyte counts and electrolyte disturbances some patients have impaired in cardiac renal and liver functions diagnostic value of x-ray and ct for patients in hunan was lower on account of no significant pathological changes in the lungs of most early covid-19 patients10 most patients presented with fever but hardly accompanied with dyspneamost patients are accompanied by fever instead of the symptoms of dyspnea which is significantly different from the clinical symptoms of patients in wuhan this may be rare related to the second-generation infection of the virus outside wuhan in an early report in wuhan china 2-10 of covid-19 patients developed symptoms of diarrhea such patients are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit icu and there are related studies showing that transmission of sars-cov-2 may be faecal-oral in our study it was found that patients outside hubei may have up to 15 of their first symptoms as diarrhea it is worth mentioning that more patients in hunan suffer from the diarrhea and the stool nucleic acid positive rate is higher all of the above phenomenon may be related to regional differences therefore every doctor needs to be alert to such a phenomenon whether to perform sars-cov-2 nucleic acid detection on diarrhea patients instead of only those patients with flu symptoms such findings have more positive significance for the global prevention and control of covid-19all covid-19 patients are negative in influenza ab virus nucleic acid and this phenomenon suggesting there may be interference between viruses when two viruses infect the same cell or body the phenomenon that one virus inhibits the replication of another virus is called interference11 and the specific mechanism needs further researchdue to various factors such as specimen type collection method transportation and performance limitations of the kit the positive rate of rt-pcr screening for new coronary pneumonia is not ideal the total positive rate of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid detection is about 60 which sometimes cannot meet the clinical requirements however the specificity of chest ct diagnosis of covid-19 is only 25 as the disease progresses the specificity of ct will be lower and it is difficult to distinguish covid-19 from general pneumonia the rate of missed diagnosis of nucleic acid detection is high and there are many patients in wuhan at this point ct screening showed its advantages it can help detect patients as soon as possible and then the patients will be isolated and treated as soon as possible it is affordable to combining ct screening and nucleic acid detection because of the fewer patients in hunan and other placesduring the initial screening process a comprehensive analysis of the patients epidemiological history symptoms and laboratory tests is required if necessary further chest ct or combination with nucleic acid testing is performed the laboratory nucleic acid test is a crucial tool for detecting viral pneumonia anytime if the hunan area hospitals adopt clinical covid-19 diagnosis measures similar to hubei area it will often lead to a higher misdiagnosis rate during the epidemic period the lower lymphocyte count of the test results is more suggestive pharyngeal swabs and stool simultaneous nucleic acid testing are still the first choices for early diagnosis of patients with sars-cov-2 in hunaninterestingly we also found that four patients were diagnosed with covid-19 without clinical symptoms all of them have a history of wuhan sojourn or contact with relevant people therefore suspected-infected patients without clinical symptoms still need to be excluded via nucleic acid testing screening of crowd who contacts of confirmed covid-19 patients is currently recommended whats more systematic screening of crowd outside of health care facilities and avoiding cluster activities should be encouraged12sheng yin and yizhi peng have the same contribution min wang and wenlong wang have the same contribution and are corresponding authors

city hubei province in china lu et al 2020 since this time the virus has rapidly spread across mainland china and now has reached other countries li et al 2020a chen et al 2020a in the early stages of this virus spread several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported patients have been diagnosed with severe acute respiratory infection symptoms and others with rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome acute respiratory failure and other serious complications leading to death nijuan et al 2013 the chinese center for disease control and prevention ccdc identified this infection as a novel coronavirus infection on jan 7 2020 and on feb 11 2020 the who announced a new name for the epidemic disease as 2019-new coronavirus disease 2019-ncov and now known as covid-19 organization wh 2020 additionally the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named 2019-ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 covid-19 has become a major global health concern and the who declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic on march 2020 whitworth 2020 as of april 14 2020 covid-19 has affected more than 1948617 patients in 210 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances and left around 121846 deaths worldwidecoronaviruses are belonging to the family coronaviridae order nidovirales and include viruses with a single-strand positive-sense rna genome approximately 2632 kilobases in size weiss and navas-martin 2005 the coronaviridae family contains four genera to include alpha-coronavirus alphacov beta-coronavirus betacov delta-coronavirus deltacov and gamma-coronavirus gammacov bats and rodents are thought to be the reservoir for alphacov and betacov currently it is less clear which animals serve as the reservoir for deltacov and gammacov coronaviruses are named according to their appearance under the electron microscope the viruses look like they are covered with pointed structures that surround them like a corona or crown due to the presence of spike glycoproteins on their envelope fig 1
these viruses typically affect the respiratory tracts of birds and mammals including humans in general the reservoir of these viruses is in animals that infrequent spillover into humans with intermediate host species likely filling the gap among humans covs mostly cause insignificant respiratory infections to include those detected in the common cold nevertheless some recent covs can cause more serious diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov zumla et al 2016 su et al 2016 sars-cov and mers-cov are caused by zoonotic coronaviruses that belong to the betacov genus in 2003 an outbreak of sars started in china and spread to other countries before ending in 2004 falsey and walsh 2003 a total of 8098 cases in 37 countriesregions had probable sars diagnoses globally resulting in 775 deaths case-fatality rate 1012 with most of these cases of infection and deaths occurring in mainland china and hong kong christian et al 2004 in contrast a total of 1621 cases of mers have been reported resulting in 584 deaths case-fatality rate 36 the initial known case of mers was in a 60-year-old patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in jeddah saudi arabia in 2012 mers still sporadically manifests in several different countries raj et al 2014 upon infection with sars-cov-2 the virus binds to a host cells angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors ace2 is commonly expressed on the epithelial cells of alveoli trachea bronchi and bronchial serous glands of the respiratory tract liu et al 2011 the virus enters and replicates in these cells the new developed virions are then released and infect new target cells the life cycle and mechanism of pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 from attachment to reproduction is shown in fig 2
the new coronavirus 2019-ncov is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna virus and is in the betacov genus which also includes sars-cov and mers-cov the 2019-ncov shares 89 nucleotide identity with bat sars-like covzxc21 and 82 identity with human sars-cov chan et al 2020 therefore the 2019-ncov was named sars-cov-2 early studies reported possible animal-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 and human-to-human transmission through droplets or direct contact li et al 2020a for prevention of virus spread some studies showed that the 2019-ncov is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat like other covs moreover covs can be functionally inactivated by using different solvents to include ethanol 70 ether 75 chlorine-containing disinfectants and othersas of now there is no specific antiviral medication available for covid-19 treatment and also no vaccine is currently available health care providers generally treat the symptoms by using oxygen therapy for patients with severe infection for severe acute cases there may be additional options for treatment including research drugs and therapeutics organization wh 2020 zumla et al 2016 currently the challenge for the who and many countries is finding an effective drug to defeat the virus or a vaccine that can be used on healthy individuals to prevent them from being infected since there is no effective drug or vaccine the best procedures as of now are to control the source of infection early diagnosis isolation and supportive treatments for individuals good personal hygiene and avoiding crowded places will help to prevent 19-ncov infection in this review we summarize the current state of knowledge surrounding covid-19 and discuss the discovery and development of new virus-based and host-based therapeutic options for covid-19although health officials are still tracing the exact source of the 2019 novel coronavirus early hypotheses thought it may be linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan city where live animals are sold to include snakes marmots birds frogs and hedgehogs zhang et al nd some people who visited the market developed viral pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus this fact suggested that animals initially transmitted the virus to humans however people with a more recent diagnosis had no connections with or exposure to the market confirming that humans can pass the virus to each other the 2019 novel coronavirus is a zoonotic virus meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals some studies have shown that the bat is the possible species of origin of the 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 because sars-cov-2 shows 96 whole-genome identity with a bat cov batcov ratg13 from rhinolophus affinis zhou et al 2020 nevertheless sars-cov and mers-cov are generally transmitted into intermediate hosts to include masked palm civets and camels respectively before jumping to humans cui et al 2019 a number of scientists pointed out that as a result of the similarity of this new virus with sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 has probably moved from un unknown intermediate host to humans or directly to humans zhou et al 2020as of jan 17 2020 a chinese team conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-ncov and all other known coronaviruses they proposed that 2019-ncov has most similar codon usage bias with snakes ji et al 2020 snakes often hunt bats in the wild reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in wuhan raising the possibility that the 2019-ncov might have jumped from the host species bats to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak however how the virus could adapt to both cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery ji et al 2020 moreover there is no reliable evidence that coronaviruses live in hosts other than mammals and birds bassetti et al 2020 therefore there is probably a mammal intermediate host for 2019-ncov zhang et al 2020a on march 19 2020 a published article showed that the pangolin-cov genome exhibited 91 and 906 nucleotide identity with sars-cov-2 and batcov ratg13 respectively this study provides the first report of a potential closely related kin pangolin-cov of sars-cov-2 which was discovered from dead malayan pangolins manis javanica identifying the pangolin a possible intermediate host of the 2019-ncov zhang et al nd zhang et al 2020a although current understanding mostly points to the pangolin as the most likely intermediate host for the new coronavirus it is possible other animals as also may be intermediate hosts generally coronaviruses are well-known to have many intermediate animal hosts in 2003 studies showed that the palm civet paguma larvata is the major intermediate host of sars-cov but other reports also suggest that the raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides and ferret badger melogale moschata play a similar role as intermediate hosts guan et al 2003 consequently even with the uncovering of the pangolin-cov additional searching for other probable intermediate hosts should be continued fig 3
with increasing cases of infection with 2019-ncov several studies have proposed that human-to-human transmission is a probable route for the covid-19 outbreak these studies are supported by the number of infection cases that happened within families and among people who did not visit the local animal market in wuhan carlos et al 2020 the virus mainly spreads from one person to another usually through close contact or through respiratory drops produced when the infected person coughs or sneezes which is why it is important to keep more than two meters 6 ft 7 in away from a sick person li et al 2020a however it is not just sneezing or coughing that is the source of transmission of the coronavirus infection there are other ways to transmit the virus to include spreading from one person to another through surfaces that have been touched by the infected person especially after studies have demonstrated that the virus remains alive on surfaces for possibly up to 9 days phan et al 2020 riou and althaus 2020 people can then develop covid-19 disease when they come into contact with these objects or surfaces and then touch their eyes nose or mouth moreover studies to date indicate that 2019-ncov is transmitted primarily through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air a person who suffers from a mild cough and does not feel ill can infect covid-19 there is another way in which coronavirus can spread among people through feces transmission but this route of infection is limited according to recent research from the ccdc the virus may be present in feces in some infected cases though its spread through this pathway is not a major feature of the outbreak xiao et al 2020 gu et al 2020 nevertheless given the risks involved this is another reason to maintain good hygiene after using the toilet and before eatingat this time very little is known regarding the effect of 2019-ncov on pregnant women and infants and there are currently no special recommendations for pregnant women regarding the disease schwartz and graham 2020 the cdc does not have any evidence indicating the possibility of negative pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women with covid-19 although two of the other coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov have been associated with more severe diseases and greater mortality in pregnant women maxwell et al 2017 assiri et al 2016 a report by the china-who joint mission published in mid-february 2020 showed that in 147 pregnant women infected with 2019-ncov 8 of the cases were considered severe and 1 were critical chen et al 2020b these numbers appear to be comparable with non-pregnant infected cases another article published on march 7 2020 showed clinical data from nine pregnant women in china with confirmed covid-19 pneumonia the physical appearance of these patients with covid-19 infection during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with covid-19 none of the nine patients developed severe pneumonia or died chen et al 2020b in the limited number of available cases in which newborns were born from mothers with 2019-ncov no children were infected with the virus in addition the virus did not appear in samples of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus while in uterus furthermore 2019-ncov does not pass through the placenta schwartz and graham 2020 no scientific studies have been done on the 2019-ncov and breast milk a newborn in london has tested positive for 2019-ncov just minutes after being born to a mother who was also infected with the virus according to news reports this is not the first case because the chinese authorities confirmed that an infant in wuhan china had tested positive for the 2019-ncov thirty hrs after being born the babys mother was a covid-19 patient reliable data is needed to understand how these infants are infected and whether transmission of the virus to the fetus occurs pregnancy or sometime during or after deliverydespite the wide spread of 2019-ncov it appears that children in general well tolerate the virus presenting few complications covid-19 in children 2020 significantly this pattern is similar to previous cov epidemic outbreaks such as sars-cov and mers-cov whose symptoms did not widely appear in children no child died during the sars-cov epidemic in 2003 with the majority of the 800 deaths in people over the age of 45 years kliegman et al 2007 furthermore it is not surprising that these viruses lead to only mild inflammation in children and more serious diseases in adults the most prominent examples of this in history is smallpox which had a minor effect on children but was catastrophic in adults lee et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 children recover quickly and in general completely while it severe complications to include death result in adults ludvigsson 2020 adults may be more susceptible to the virus because they are more likely to be infected with other diseases such as diabetes high blood pressure or heart disease which weakens their ability to ward off infection in a large study chinese researchers examined the results of infection with the 2019-ncov in more than 2000 confirmed or suspected childhood cases it was found that just over half of the children had mild cold-like symptoms or did not have symptoms at all lee et al 2020 presently children appear to be the least affected by the consequences of the disease and the number of infected children under 19 years old has not exceed 2 of all infected people in the world and there are no deaths under the age of 9 years zheng et al 2020 scientists cannot fully explain this phenomenon but there are some medical theories that may explain indeed contrary to the general perception a childs immune system is more efficient than adults for example adults are 25 and 10 times more likely to die from chickenpox and seasonal influenza than children respectively zhou et al ndsars-cov-2 is believed to be from the bat and is therefore primarily able to survive and thrive in the internal organs of animals the transmission of sars-cov-2 from humans to pets has not yet been established however a study has considered the opportunity of human-transmission-animal sars-cov was isolated from a pig during a survey for probable ways of viral transmission after a sars epidemic in 2003 in china sequence and epidemiology analyses proposed that the pig was infected by a sars-cov of human origin chen et al 2005if someone is infected with the 19-ncov the first symptoms usually appear after five to six days according to the who reports li et al 2020a however there are individual cases in which the incubation period of the virus can last for up to 40 days with a median incubation period of 14 days wang et al 2020a the incubation period for severe cases may be different compared to mild cases and depend on the age of the patient and their immune response this period tended to be shorter among patients 70 years 115 days than those aged 70 years 20 days wang et al 2020a the symptoms of covid-19 are usually like a normal cold and influenza and do not become severe however it is different for people suffering from underlying diseases such as diabetes heart lung and other diseases in this case the disease can take on critical forms that sometimes lead to death some people have no symptoms mild pneumonia the most common symptoms of covid-19 according to a recent who report that was done on more than 70000 cases in china are the following fever in 88 of cases dry cough and sore throat 68 fatigue 38 and diarrhea 4 which were similar to sars-cov and mers-cov yang et al 2020a wang et al nd furthermore severe shortness of breath occurred in nearly 20 of cases and around 13 had a sore throat or severe headache generally 19-ncov is a member of coronaviruses family that usually attack the respiratory system some patients are disposed to various complications to include acute respiratory distress syndrome acute heart injury and secondary infection with bacteria fig 4
 chen et al 2020cthe virus first infects the lining cells of the throat trachea and lung transforming these cells into virus factories that produce huge amounts of viruses that infect more cells the high temperature and feeling of general malaise are caused by the response of the immune system to the virus and sending signals to the body to release cytokines however the virus disrupts the immune response and the body gets more inflammation than needed lei et al 2020 inside the lungs oxygen travels to the blood but in the case of severe pneumonia the alveoli begin to fill with water and may cause shortness of breath in some cases this results in coughing with sputum which is a thick mucus that contains lung cells killed by the 19-ncov the problem may not be limited to the lungs as 19-ncov attacks other important organs in the body to include the kidneys which may lead to organ failure li et al 2020b a recent study found that the virus might affect renal tubular cells and testicular cells due to the high expression of ace2 which is often found in the membranes of the lungs kidneys cells and cells in seminiferous ducts of the testis consequently 19-ncov may directly bind to such ace2 bearing cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients fan et al 2020 nevertheless incomplete evidence is presented concerning the involvement of reproductive organs in patients infected with 2019-ncov researchers have detected new symptoms of infection with the 19-ncov related to the digestive system such as loss of appetite diarrhea vomiting and major disorders of the digestive system patients who had digestive problems related to the 19-ncov tended to worsen compared to patients without symptoms of the digestive system the 19-ncov destroys the gastrointestinal bacteria leading to these symptoms in the digestive system zhang and xu 2020 the first two patients who died in wuhan seemed to be in good health although they had been smoking for a long time and this lead to a weakening of their lungs the first 61 years old patient had acute pneumonia upon arrival at the hospital he had acute respiratory distress syndrome despite the use of a respirator his lungs failed and his heart stopped he died after 11 days of being hospitalized the second patient a 69-year-old man had acute respiratory distress syndrome he died as a result of acute pneumonia and septicemia huang et al 2020 more research is need to understand the causes of these symptomsthe 2019-ncov clinical diagnosis depends on the symptoms travel history to a country known to have the disease andor exposure to an infected person the who has published several testing procedures for covid-2019 the most common way of testing is using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr huang et al 2020 the test may be done on respiratory samples which can be obtain by several ways to include nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples generally results are available within a few hours to two days blood tests can be used but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value this technique works in detecting the 19-ncov by identifying the antibodies in the patient blood these antibodies are released shortly after infection and their presence confirms the presence of the virus regardless of symptoms a study by a chines team found that computed tomography ct scans displayed ground-glass opacities in 56 of the cases but 18 had no radiological results zu et al nd bilateral and peripheral ground glass opacities are the most typical ct findings the use of lung x-rays is only suitable for patients with severe symptoms which means that this technique is not suitable for diagnosing the disease in its early stages therefore several pharmaceutical companies and research organizations are racing to develop more effective and rapid test kits to detect 19-ncov among people suspected with infection in few minutes and without the need to transfer samples to central laboratoriesthe rapidly spreading 2019-ncov outbreak continued to upend life around the world as more countries tighten quarantine measures on march 11 the covid-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the who the disease is still spreading around the world and the viral infection has already reached small islands and african countries in december 8 2019 sars-cov-2 was first reported in wuhan hubei province and spread to the rest of china cascella et al 2020 as of april 14 2020 the number of covid-19-diagnosed patients increased to 1948617 cases in 210 countries and territories around the world and two international conveyances so far the number of those recovering has reached about 460541 while 121846 have died from the disease case-fatality rate 625 fig 5
 although covid-19 has killed more people than other coronaviruses the case fatality rate of sars-cov-2 is less than that of sars-cov and mers-cov which are 1012 and 36 respectively mahase 2020the most up-to-date source for the epidemiology of this emerging pandemic can be found at the who covid-19 situation board currently the us has more covid-19 cases than any other country 588465 cases 23711 deaths case-fatality rate 402 the first case of human-to-human transmission of covid-19 was reported in the us on january 30 2020 now all 50 states have reported cases of covid-19 the other countries with the most cases are spain 172541 cases 18056 deaths case-fatality rate 105 italy 159516 cases 20465 deaths case-fatality rate 128 the highest fatality rate among other countries france 136779 cases 14967 deaths case-fatality rate 109 germany 130694 cases 3261 deaths case-fatality rate 25 the lowest fatality rate united kingdom 93873 cases 10107 deaths case-fatality rate 107 china mainland 82249 cases 3341 deaths case-fatality rate 406 and the islamic republic of iran 74877 cases 4683 deaths case-fatality rate 625 fig 6
persons of any age can be infected by sars-cov-2 while adults of middle age and older are most generally affected in most studies of hospitalized patients with clinically confirmed covid-19 the average age ranged from 48 to 58 years huang et al 2020 in a case report from the ccdc which included 44500 confirmed infections 87 of patients were between 30 and 79 years old older age was also associated with increased mortality due to previous diseases with case fatality rates of 815 among those aged 70 to 80 years or older wu and mcgoogan 2020 similar results were found in italy with case fatality rates of 1220 among those aged 70 to 80 years or older onder et al 2020 a report of 460 covid-19 patients who died in italy showed a number of previous diseases that might have increased their risk of death the median age of these patients was 795 years of patients who died 117 254 had ischemic heart disease 126 274 had diabetes 72 157 had cancer 87 189 had atrial fibrillation 24 52 had dementia and 34 74 had had a stroke saglietto et al nd in the us more than 3000 patients were diagnosed with covid-19 between february 10 and march 15 2020 of these 67 were aged 45 years this is similar to reports from china where mortality was highest among older individuals with 80 of deaths occurring in those aged 65 years httpdxdoiorg1015585mmwrmm6912e2it is becoming apparent that sars-cov-2 may also discriminate by sex with men more likely to test positive and more likely to die from the disease this trend was first seen in china where one analysis found a fatality rate of 28 in men compared with 17 in women guan et al 2020 since then the pattern has been mirrored in france germany iran italy south korea and spain at this point in time most theories about why the virus might be hitting men harder than women are speculative in many countries and especially in china men are more likely to smoke than women which is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of covid-19 moreover females generally having greater or more robust immune responses than males yang et al 2020bunfortunately no medicine or anti-virus vaccine has yet been officially approved to treat covid-19-associated pathologies at present clinical management includes infection prevention control measures and supportive care including supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilation when indicated while many countries are working toward a vaccine against sars-cov-2 it is almost certain that there will be no vaccine available before the end of this year therefore pressure has built to find another drug to effectively counter the virus this effort has mostly focused on repurposing existing medicines health officials from the who have noted many drugs that demonstrated efficacy in treating the 2019-ncov infection the main treatment so far for this virus is using antivirals which weaken the ability of viruses to enter cells and prevent them from multiplying or moving from infected cells to others antibiotics have no role in treating covid-19 patients but they can be used in the case of a secondary bacterial infectionsince the disease first appeared in december 2019 in china this country has begun to test the effectiveness of different types of drugs used previously to treat other diseases to include malaria and hiv drugs antivirals blood plasma derivatives and arthritis drugs li and de clercq 2020 china has relied on the use of the anti-viral drug favilavir to treat the symptoms of covid-19 this medication was initially developed by toyama chemical to treat nose and throat infections li et al nd although the results of the study have not yet been published it is assumed that the drug has proven effective in treating symptoms of covid-19 in a clinical trial of more than 70 patients with minimal side effects favilavir is an antiviral drug that was approved in japan in 2014 to treat influenza it currently also has been approved for treating covid-19 in these countries elfiky 2020 favilavir is not currently approved by the us food and drug administration fda li and de clercq 2020 another anti-virus drug remdesivir showed efficacy by resisting two viruses similar to covid-19 sars-cov and mers-cov in animals wang et al 2020b remdesivir gs-5734 is a broad-based antiviral drug originally designed to target ebola and was developed by gilead sciences it inhibits viral replication through premature termination of rna transcription which disrupts the viruss ability to reproduce li et al nd china announced that clinical trials of remdesiver have officially started in a number of hospitals in wuhan to test its efficacy against covid-19 moreover one clinical trial has also been approved by the fda in the united states on january 19 2020 remdesiver was given to a 35-year-old man in washington state he has recovered from covid-19 holshue et al 2020 however the efficacy and safety of remdesiver in patients with 2019-ncov infection still need to be further confirmed by clinical studieschloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs used to treat malaria as well as chemoprophylaxis and certain inflammatory conditions to include rheumatoid arthritis lupus and the blood disorder porphyria cutanea tarda respectively they have been approved by the fda to be tested against covid-19 dong et al 2020a researchers have found that both drugs have in vitro activity against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against sars-cov-2 based on these results chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently recommended for treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients in several countries including in the u s a chinese study showed that when chloroquine was tested on more than 100 patients it had superior results compared to a control drug inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung-imaging findings promoting a virus negative conversion and shortening the disease course zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi 2020 gao et al 2020 however both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are never used to prevent covid-19 because there are frequent side effects associated with their uses such as worsening vision nausea digestive disorders and more severe cases can lead to heart failure a man in arizona died and his wife was in critical condition after taking chloroquine prophylactically to prevent sars-cov-2 infectionin 2003 protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir anti-retroviral drugs showed activity against sars-cov and was associated with improvement in some patients chu et al 2004 chan et al 2003 lopinavirritonavir are sold under the name kaletra by abbvie and are designed to treat hiv aids to evaluate the efficacy of lopinavirritonavir for sars-cov-2 infection 99 patients with positive infections were treated with lopinavirritonavir no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment compare to standard care cao et al 2020 however in south korea a 54-year-old man was given a combination of these two medications and had a significant and substantial decrease in the levels of the -coronavirus lim et al 2020 according to the who there may be benefits to using lopinavirritonavir with other drugs such as interferon- oseltamivir or ribavirin elfiky 2020several studies have also exposed some other drugs may have probable efficiency in treatment of covid-19 patients in china the use of tocilizumab for the treatment of severe complications related to sars-cov-2 has been approved tocilizumab marketed as actemra has been used to treat patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis to lower inflammation an initial clinical trial in china used tocilizumab on 20 acute covid-19 patients nineteen patients 95 were cured and discharged from hospital within two weeks zhang et al 2020b the fda has officially approved a phase 3 trial of actemra in severe covid-19 patients darunavir is another anti-retroviral hiv-1 protease inhibitor in vitro study was done in february 2020 by chinese researchers has showen darunavir significantly inhibited sars-cov-2 replication and its inhibition efficacy was more than that in the untreated group by 280-fold dong et al 2020b an anti-parasitic drug called ivermectin has been shown to be effective against the sars-cov-2 virus in an in-vitro study by researchers at monash university in melbourne australia caly et al 2020 further clinical trials need to be completed to confirm the effectiveness of the drug in humans with covid-19the fda has approved the using of blood plasma from patients who have recovered from covid-19 with a high neutralizing antibody titer and they may be a valuable donor source of convalescent plasma cp chen et al 2020d cp is a classic adaptive immunotherapy has been applied to the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases for more than one century this plasma therapy may be more effective if it is given to covid-19 patients early to eliminate the virus before it causes serious damage in their lungs this procedure was used during the deadly influenza outbreak in 1918 and also as a treatment for measles in the 1930s in recent years plasma therapy has been used for ebola sars and h1n1 victims van griensven et al 2016 cheng et al 2005 some studies indicate that plasma has had some success in reducing symptoms and deaths in previous epidemics during the sars epidemic in 2003 a study of 80 patients in hong kong showed that they had a chance to recover within two weeks of symptoms following cp therapy as compared to other patients cheng et al 2005 as there is a similarity between sars and covid-19 cp therapy might be a hopeful treatment option for covid-19 patients after studies conducted in china to measure the effectiveness of cp therapy and their impact on the condition of those treated and recovered from infection with the 2019-ncov hospitals in new york city are preparing to use the plasma blood of those recovering from the 2019-ncov as a potential antidote to the disease duan et al 2020 jawhara 2020 however there is a small possibility of risk of using cp therapy by transmission of some blood-borne pathogen to include human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis b virus hbv or hepatitis c virus hcv maclennan and barbara 2006at least 10 proposed drugsvaccines for sars-cov-2 are under development researchers hope to start the first stage of clinical trials within 4 weeks these will be small trials that are first conducted on healthy people to ensure the safety of the vaccine second stage trials start within approximately 8 months during which the effectiveness of the vaccine will be tested in a large group of people it is estimated that it may take around 1218 months before a vaccine becomes available healthcare biotechnology company entos pharmaceuticals is developing a dna vaccine for the prevention of covid-19 infections using its fusogenix naomedicine platform fusogenix a proprietary proteo-lipid vehicle plv for genetic medicines enables the formulation of effective dna vaccines that can be administered like the flu vaccine the vaccine payload will be plasmid dna encoding multiple antigens from key sars-cov-2 proteins to promote maximum protection at-100 a recombinant form of human surfactant protein-d rhsp-d was developed by airway therapeutics as a treatment for covid-19 it has been shown to be effective in preclinical studies in reducing inflammation and infection in the lungs while also generating an immune response against various respiratory diseases crouch 2000 canadas medicago has successfully produced a virus-like particle vlp of the sars-cov-2 just 20 days after obtaining the sars-cov-2 gene this is an important step in developing a usable vaccine vlp-like particles are multiprotein structures that resemble native viruses but do not contain the viral genome and thus are safe they can be used to stimulate a bodys ability to produce antibodies and stimulate cellular immunity with the aim of responding to the virus without the risk of infection roldao et al 2010 i-mab biopharma is developed tjm2 a neutralizing antibody as a treatment for cytokine release syndrome common in patients suffering from a severe infection of sars-cov-2 tjm2 targets the human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf which is responsible for acute and chronic inflammation shimabukuro-vornhagen et al 2018 tzls-501 is developed by tiziana life sciences as a monoclonal antibody to treat covid-19 it is a human anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody which helps prevent lung damage and elevated levels of il-6 during the disease early tests have shown that this treatment rapidly depletes circulating levels of il-6 in the blood rayner et al 2020 chadox1 ncov-19 is a vaccine currently being investigated for prophylaxis against sars-cov-2 the chadox1 viral vector was developed at the university of oxford and originally developed against mers-cov the chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine produced in a partnership between the university of oxfords jenner institute and italian pharmaceutical manufacturer advent srl consists of an attenuated adenovirus capable of producing the spike s protein of sars-cov-2 allowing for the formation of endogenous antibodies against these proteins and consequently against sars-cov-2 alharbi et al 2017currently there is no conclusive evidence that ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory drugs increases the risk of serious complications or of acquiring the virus that causes covid-19 there is also no conclusive evidence that taking anti-inflammatory drugs is harmful for other respiratory infections sodhi and etminan 2020vaccine development takes time thus for now it remains extremely important to follow guidance on social separation frequent hand washing and disinfecting your homes and workplaces xiao et al nd several reports show that sars-cov-2 may spread more easily and cause life-threatening illness compared to other cov viruses like other coronaviruses it can survive in the air for up to 3 h and may stay on plastic for 72 h 48 h on stainless steel 24 h on cardboard and 4 h on copper van doremalen et al 2020 however sars-cov-2 multiplies fastest in the body even when an infected person does not show symptoms and can be passed to other the prophet of islam mohamed peace and blessings of allah be upon him recommended hygiene and quarantine during a pandemic more than 1440 years ago hadiths of the prophet sayings and teachings in this context one of which is if you heard about plague in a land do not enter it and if it occurred in a land while you are there do not leave it the who and other organizations have issued some basic guidelines to prevent covid-19 including i washing your hands frequently and carefully especially after contact with infected people or their environment ii avoid touching your face including mouth nose and eyes iii cover your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing iv take social distancing seriously by keeping a distance of 6 ft from other people and v self-quarantine if sick and wear a mask when you need medical care jin et al 2020 wang et al 2020c furthermore the who announced a document regarding the laboratory biosafety guidance related to the 2019-ncov healthcare providers and researchers must wear ffp3 or n95 masks and other protective gear when around covid-19 patients wang et al 2020c for healthy people wearing a mask may not be the best way to prevent getting an infection 2019-ncov may likely be susceptible to disinfectants with proven activity against enveloped viruses including bleach sodium hypochlorite 70 ethanol 05 hydrogen peroxide quaternary ammonium compounds and phenolic compounds if used according to manufacturers recommendations other biocidal agents such as 00502 benzalkonium chloride or 002 chlorhexidine digluconate can be less effective infection prevention and control of epidemic- and pandemic-prone acute respiratory infections in health care 2014 rabenau et al 2005although some evidence suggests that warmer weather may slow the spread of the virus wang et al 2020d the who continues to recommend the following of all official guidelines it is still too early to know how sars-cov-2 interacts with hot weather but the spread of other coronaviruses were slowed in warmer environmentsthe outbreak of covid-19 spread across china rapidly and has spread to 199 countriesterritoriesareas outside of china as of march 29 2020 drug discovery against sars-cov-2 is a challenging process but is vital furthermore anti-virus vaccine development is also significant to counter this epidemic therefore more structural biology details and details about the 2019-ncov life cycle are needed these likely will accelerate the development of drugs andor vaccine against sars-cov-2 likewise it is very important to continue to follow the who guidelines to prevent the spread of

the authors declare no conflict of interestin december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases with unclear pathogenesis was reported in wuhan hubei province china on january 9 2020 a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of this condition 1 this virus was named by world health organization who as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 and the disease it caused was named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 2 the outbreak rapidly became an epidemic across china over january consequently covid-19 was urgently classified as a class b communicable disease and was managed as a class a communicable disease in accordance with the law of the peoples republic of china on the prevention and treatment of infectious disease
3 various mitigation measures led to effective containment of the virus in early february significant declines in infection in late february and nationwide control by mid-marchat the same time the covid-19 epidemic continued to spread around the globe with rapid increases in case numbers in european and american countries 4 the world health organization who officially declared a global pandemic on march 11 2020 by march 18 the number of cumulative confirmed cases outside of china exceeded that in china for the first time as of march 31 the pandemic had spread to 178 countries on six continents with a total of 788 522 diagnosed cases of which 706 282 were identified outside of china 5wuhan as the center of the outbreak in china placed high priority on constraining the covid-19 epidemic both the state and the local government undertook a series of active prevention and control intervention measures in wuhan on january 23 wuhan implemented traffic restrictions immediately after a first-level response to a major public health emergency was launched which is the highest level of emergency response to a public health crisis in china according to the scope and degree of its impact urban bus subway ferry and long-distance passenger transportation in wuhan were all suspended and departure channels in airport and railway stations were also temporarily closed down 6 consequently during january 2331 population outflow from wuhan declined to 6 of that in the same period in 2019 and travel intensity within wuhan declined to 23 of that in the same period in 2019 7 in addition wuhan initiated a universal symptom survey during february 610 followed by a second round during february 1719on february 12 clinical diagnostic criteriain addition to the diagnosis by positive laboratory nucleic acid test results of sars-cov-2were implemented in hubei province including wuhan this criteria resulted in a sharp increment of cases in subsequent days likely reflecting the number of cumulative unconfirmed cases identified during the initial universal symptom survey the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia trial fifth edition released on february 5 by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china indicated that patients with clinical and radiological characteristics typical of covid-19 could be diagnosed as positive even in the absence of a positive nucleic acid test 8 diagnosed individuals were then isolated to prevent further transmissionthese various measures slowed down the growth of the epidemic in wuhan effects of the travel ban in wuhan on the spread of covid-19 have been studied 9 10 however the contribution of implementing universal symptom surveys and clinical diagnostic criteria to epidemic control in wuhan has not yet been delineated here we extend a transmission dynamics model to fit the epidemic trend in wuhan and evaluate the effects attributable to these major interventions ie universal symptom surveys and clinical diagnostic criteria our results may provide critical insight for the international community for current and future epidemic responsedata were collected from the official websites of the wuhan municipal health commission 11 and the national health commission of the peoples republic of china 12 as detailed in table 1
 numbers of daily new and cumulative confirmed cases were collected from january 15 to march 30 2020 all confirmed cases had positive laboratory nucleic acid test results confirming infection with sars-cov-2 in addition we extracted the frequencies of cases reported during february 1214 using clinical diagnostic criteria in the absence of positive nucleic acid testing according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia trial fifth edition released by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china on february 5 2020 8we extended the traditional susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed seir transmission dynamics model to account for unconfirmed infections and quarantine the seirq dynamics model the population was divided into four traditional seir compartmentssusceptibles s latent cases exposed e unconfirmed cases not quarantined i and removed individuals rand three additional quarantined compartmentsquarantined susceptibles s

directly fitting the reported number of cumulative confirmed cases was impractical due to a sharp increase in cases when the clinical diagnostic criteria were implemented during february 1214 instead the 14 953 clinically diagnosed cases resultant in that short period were regarded as cumulative cases that were unconfirmed due to missing or negative nucleic acid testing results these cases correspond to compartment i in the proposed seirq dynamics modeldaily frequencies of laboratory-confirmed cases from january 15 to february 14 31 d and unconfirmed cases from february 12 to 14 3 d were used simultaneously to fit the dynamics model model i the fourth-order runge-kutta method rk4 was used to solve the differential equations estimates from rk4 were used as initial settings for a markov chain monte carlo mcmc to estimate the parameters implementation of universal symptom surveys february 610 and 1719 and clinical diagnostic criteria february 1214 was accompanied by the isolation of cases and would therefore be expected to alter transmission thus the contact rate  after february 14 was re-estimated by partitioned fitting using mcmc with initial values from the outputs at february 14 of model i model ii in addition smoothed sequential effective reproductive numbers rt 14 15 were estimated based on the outputs of the dynamics modelthe guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia trial fifth edition suggested implementing clinical diagnostic criteria only for hubei province 8 individuals could be classified as suspected infections if they had clinical manifestations of fever andor respiratory symptoms and normal or decreased white blood cell counts in the early stage of disease or decreased lymphocyte count suspected infections could be diagnosed as covid-19 cases if typical viral pneumonia characteristics were demonstrated via computed tomography ct imaging of the lungs without confirmatory results by nucleic acid testingall communities were closed and all residents remained at home during the universal symptom survey period during february 610 first round and february 1719 second round thousands of community workers and volunteers screened all residents using grid searching of all communities in order to trace four categories of population infected patients suspected patients fever patients with a body temperature  373 c who could not be ruled out of possible infection and persons who had had close contact with the infections the body temperature of the residents was collected through spontaneous reporting by recommended mobile applications or phone calling or through door-to-door and individual-to-individual visiting by community workers and volunteers the four categories of the population were centrally quarantined and given appropriate treatment if necessarythe effect of the implementation of a universal symptom survey and clinical diagnostic criteria was evaluated by comparing observed epidemic data from wuhan with the trend predicted by the dynamics model fitted for data before february 14 model i the effect of the interventions was quantified as days in advance for achieving daily emerging cases fewer than 100 or 10 days in advance for achieving the first day of zero increment and the decrease in the number of cumulative confirmed cases as of march 30 in addition sequential rt curves based on model ii were generated to show the impact of the mitigation strategies on the covid-19 epidemic trajectory versus those based on model iberkeley madonna version 9119 berkeley madonna inc usa was used to fit and explore the appropriate range of parameters r version 363 r foundation for statistical computing austria and the debinfer version 042 package were used to perform mcmc for 200 000 simulations followed by 100 000 burn-ins

clinically diagnosed cases reported during february 1214 were considered to be unconfirmed infections and the dynamics model for the epidemic trend in wuhan through february 14 was fitted model i cumulative frequencies for unconfirmed cases identified by clinical diagnosis and laboratory-confirmed infections diagnosed by positive nucleic acid test results were fitted respectively fig 2
a the number of overall infections including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases was summarized fig 2a the median proportion of unconfirmed cases was estimated as 40 of the total infections the unconfirmed proportion was relatively high during the early phase of the epidemic in january median 55 range 4271 when the trend of the epidemic in wuhan up to february 14 was carried forward the model predicted that the daily number of newly diagnosed cases would drop below 100 by march 25 and below 10 by april 29 in addition the model predicted that the first day with 0 new cases would be expected by may 31 and that the number of overall infections including laboratory-confirmed and unconfirmed cases would eventually accumulate to 69 957 fig 2abased on observed data the number of daily emerging cases gradually dropped after february 14 furthermore a remarkable decline in daily new cases was observed beginning february 19 which aligned with the average expected incubation period of 57 d after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria the dates on which daily new case counts fell below 100 fell below 10 and reached 0 in wuhan were march 6 march 11 and march 18 respectively these dates were 19 49 and 74 d earlier than those predicted by model i fig 2b by march 30 the number of cumulative observed infections was 50 006 which was 19 951 cases fewer than the number of cumulative infections predicted by model i if the trend before february 14 were to be carried forward fig 2b notably the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia trial sixth edition released on february 19 no longer supported clinical diagnostic criteria for covid-19 for a conservative estimation the predicted number of unconfirmed cases after february 19 was subtracted from the overall number of infections nonetheless the actual situation in wuhan remained optimistic compared with the predicted trend fig 2ctransmission parameters after february 14 would be expected to differ due to the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys in wuhan both of which were paired with the isolation of identified cases in order to control transmission sources and cut off transmission routes thus the contact rate  after february 14 was re-estimated by partitioned fitting using mcmc model ii sequential effective reproductive numbers rt were estimated by the outputs of model i and model ii and by actual frequencies with calibration for the frequencies before february 12 fig 3
 rt demonstrated a steady downward trend since the first round of universal symptom survey during february 610 showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of the clinical diagnostic criteria during february 1214 and closely approached 0  01 after march 5 this curve aligned with the actual epidemic data for wuhanover the course of the covid-19 epidemic in china improved clinical understanding of the virus and disease enabled multiple refinements of diagnosis and treatment guidelines by the time of this publication seven versions of the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia had been released by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china in early february a large number of suspected cases emerged in wuhan which was beyond the capacity for nucleic acid testing before the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria individuals with typical covid-19 clinical symptoms but without the nucleic acid test or with negative nucleic acid test results were unable to be diagnosed and isolated in time to prevent potential transmission most suspected cases could be infectious which increased the pressure on prevention and control effortsimplementation of the clinical diagnostic criteria produced a sharp increase in the number of covid-19 cases reported over february 1214 which led to a failure of almost all previous dynamic models at the same time the hospitalization and isolation of these cumulative suspected cases over a brief period was equivalent to cutting off transmission routes significantly curbing viral spread in wuhan indeed 57 d later by february 19 the number of daily new cases and effective reproduction decreased dramatically a second round of universal symptom survey over february 1719 further consolidated the effects of the mitigation efforts collectively the implementation of clinical diagnosis and universal symptom surveys in wuhan in early-to-mid-february reduced the number of infections by nearly 20 000 and advanced two months of critical time points it is notable that the actual data after february 19 deviated slightly from the epidemic pattern of infectious diseases as fitted by model ii suggesting that some unconfirmed cases may exista variety of traditional and extended dynamics models have been proposed using publicly accessible data on covid-19 to predict outbreak trends 13 16 17 18 19 20 21 a dynamics model applies theoretical assumptions and fits existing data to earlier epidemic patterns in order to predict the epidemic trend by carrying earlier patterns forward however in practice dynamic introductions of multiple and varying interventions and criteria challenge the validity of dynamic models these real-world changes affect the assumptions of such models and decrease their accuracyan analysis of the epidemic pattern in wuhan requires consideration of the sharp jump in case counts over february 1214 previous reports either fitted the data before the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria 20 or fitted the data without clinically diagnosed cases 10 notably song et al 22 assumed the number of clinically diagnosed cases following exponential distribution and calibrated the frequencies before february 12 for future modeling in contrast our method considered clinically diagnosed infections as a compartment in the dynamics model the curves for confirmed and unconfirmed infections were simultaneously fitted in order to obtain the trend for overall infections as a result the sharp increase in cases in wuhan was well explained by the proposed model in addition our model estimated an average proportion of 40 unconfirmed cases which was lower than the 59 unascertained infections estimated by wang et al 10we acknowledge some limitations in this study first unconfirmed infections as identified by clinical diagnosis were considered infectious in the seirq dynamics model however some of these cases due to the existence of clinical symptoms were probably hospitalized and isolated prior to diagnosis and thus had limited infectious ability second asymptomatic infections and clinical classifications of the infections were not considered in this study third a better estimation for the covid-19 epidemic trend should rely on the data of the onset information of the infections which was not publicly accessible fourth potential confounders such as further improvement of the reporting system and nucleic acid testing facility and capacity were non-negligible during the causal inference based on observational data in general a set of measures such as improvements of the reporting system and nucleic acid testing facility and capacity aimed to increase the efficiency and sensitivity of identifying cases these measures if further improved after february 14 should have contributed to an increase in the number of daily new cases after february 14 which was not in line with the facts on the other hand such confounding effects may have resulted in an underestimate of the effect in addition the effect of the interventions was the product of mitigation strategies and is thus difficult to decompose preciselythe proposed seirq dynamics model fitted the wuhan epidemic data well under a situation with an observed large short-term increase in the number of detected infections differences between the modeled outcomes and the actual data underscore that the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a lower-than-anticipated magnitude and duration of the epidemic in wuhan with the continued rapid spread of sars-cov-2 globally and for potential future infectious disease modeling the reported findings may inform the international community on infectious disease prevention and controlas of march 11 2020 118598 cases of covid-19 were reported worldwide by more than 100 countries since late february the majority of cases reported are from outside china with an increasing majority of these reported from european union eueuropean economic area eea countries and the uk the director-general of the world health organization declared covid-19 a global pandemic on march 11 2020 all eueea countries and the uk are affected reporting a total of 17413 cases as of march 11 seven-hundred eleven cases reported by eueea countries and the uk have died italy represents 58 of the cases and 88 of the fatalities the current pace of the increase in cases in the eueea and the uk mirrors trends seen in china in january to early february and trends seen in italy in mid-february 1 the end of 2019 was marked by the emergence of a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which caused an outbreak of viral pneumonia covid-19 in wuhan china 2 coronaviruses are a family of single-stranded enveloped rna viruses that are divided into four major genera the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 is 82 similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and both belong to the -genus of the coronavirus family 3-4human coronaviruses such as sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are known to cause respiratory and enteric symptoms in the sars outbreak of 2002-03 16-73 of patients with sars had diarrhea during the course of the disease usually within the first week of illness 5 sars-cov ribonucleic acid rna was only detected in stools from the fifth day of illness onwards and the proportion of stool specimens positive for viral rna progressively increased and peaked at day 11 of the illness with viral rna still present in the feces of a small proportion of patients even after 30 days of illness 6 till now infection control and surveillance focus on the respiratory system the ignorance of sars-cov-2 in the digestive system may cause difficulty with disease control gastrointestinal symptoms seem to be uncommon in patients with covid-19 when compared with sars 7-8 however they should not be ignored as the increasing rate of diarrhea occurs in confirmed covid-19 patients according to a recent report that 14 of 138 confirmed patients had diarrhea 9 those early reports may not represent the actual rate of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by sars-cov-2 because in the early stages of the outbreak the limited resources for detection were only provided to those patients with severe symptoms like respiratory distress syndrome about 27 of sars patients have diarrhea and since full-length genome sequences identified that sars-cov-2 is 795 identical to sars-cov and shares the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 it is estimated that the rate of gastrointestinal symptoms would be higher in patients with covid-19 10 one possible route for the movement of sars-cov-2 into the digestive system may be the trachea-esophagus-ileum-colon as single-cell transcriptome analysis showed ace2 the entry receptor for sars-cov-2 highly expressed in lung at2 cells esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells and enterocytes from the ileum and colon 11data and methodsliterature search and selectionwe conducted a comprehensive systematic literature search of online databases including pubmed embase web of science wanfang data and cnki from december 2019 to february 2020 to identify all

conducted independently by two investigators re and ga any disagreement was resolved by another investigator cmresultsnatural history and clinical characteristicshuang et al first reported the clinical features of 41 patients confirmed to be infected with covid-19 on january 2 2020 which include 13 intensive care unit icu cases and 28 non-icu cases 7 more than half of the cases 66 had been exposed to the huanan seafood wholesale market almost all patients had bilateral lung ground-glass opacity on computed tomography imaging the initial symptoms included fever 98 cough 76 dyspnea 55 myalgia or fatigue 44 sputum production 28 headache 8 hemoptysis 5 and diarrhea 3 only one patient did not present fever in the early stage of the disease twelve 29 cases progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards five 12 had acute cardiac injury three 7 had acute kidney injury aki and three 7 had shock at the data cutoff date 28 68 patients were discharged and six 15 had died on january 20 2020 chen et al reported 99 cases with sars-cov-2-infected pneumonia 8 this case series revealed that older males with comorbidities as a result of weaker immune function were the most susceptible to covid-19 incidence the symptoms complications and treatments in this study were similar to the previously published study by huang and colleagues at the data cutoff date 31 31 of the patients were discharged 11 11 died and 57 58 were still hospitalized a study by li et al reported on 425 covid-19 cases in wuhan confirmed between january 1 and 22 2020 12 the mean incubation period was 52 days with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 125 days though uncertainty remains two subsequent studies confirmed the pattern of signs and symptoms 13-14 at the time of this writing the most recent published case series of 138 confirmed cases included 36 requiring intensive care by the data cutoff date of february 3 2020 9 it also found the common presenting symptoms to be fever 136 fatigue 96 and dry cough 82 though there were two patients who did not present any signs of fever at the onset of illness a higher proportion of cases presented with gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and nausea 14 initially presented one to two days prior to the development of fever and dyspnea forty-seven patients 34 were discharged while six 4 died while the remainder were still hospitalized organ failure complications were similar to the original studies taken together these studies indicate the main clinical manifestations of covid-19 are fever 90 or more cough around 75 and dyspnea up to 50 a small but significant subset had gastrointestinal symptomsbasic virologycoronaviruses are widespread in humans and several other vertebrates and cause respiratory enteric hepatic and neurologic diseases notably the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 have caused human epidemics a comparison with the current virus shows several significant differences and similarities both mers-cov and sars-cov have much higher case fatality rates 40 and 10 respectively though the current sars-cov-2 shares 79 of its genome with sars-cov it appears to be much more transmissible 15 sars-cov-2 has been sequenced a phylogenetic analysis found a bat origin for sars-cov-2 there is a diversity of possible intermediate hosts for sars-cov-2 including pangolins but not mice and rats there are many similarities of sars-cov-2 with the original sars-cov using computer modeling researchers found that the spike proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have almost identical 3-d structures in the receptor-binding domain that maintains van der waals forces the sars-cov spike protein has a strong binding affinity to human ace2 based on biochemical interaction studies and crystal structure analysis sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike proteins share 765 identity in amino acid sequences and importantly the sars-cov-2 and sars-cov spike proteins have a high degree of homology 16 both sars-covs enter the cell via the ace2 receptor 17 the sars-cov-2 first predominantly infects lower airways and binds to ace2 on alveolar epithelial cells both viruses are potent inducers of inflammatory cytokines the cytokine storm or cytokine cascade is the postulated mechanism for organ damage the virus activates immune cells and induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines into pulmonary vascular endothelial cellstransmission dynamics and protective measuresthe preliminary estimate of r0 the expected number of cases directly produced by one person in a population susceptible to infection for covid-19 is 22 95 ci 14 to 39 18 fomites are suspected as the main source of infectious particles though some uncertainty remains other coronaviruses have been shown to persist for days on uncleaned surfaces 15 additionally sars-cov-2 rna was detected in the stool specimen in a person who had symptoms while the serum specimen tested negative 19 recently sars-cov-2 was isolated from a swab sample of a confirmed patients feces by chinese researchers indicating the potential for fecal-oral transmission 20 studies have shown effective person-to-person transmission of 2019-ncov even in the presence of isolation efforts in medical facilities 21-22 the recent case series reported 57 41 of 138 patients were infected in hospital settings including 40 29 medical staff 9 handwashing is the mainstay of viral control contact isolation gear such as masks gowns and gloves are also recommended transmission via the ocular surface is possible so eye protection should also be used 23enteric involvement of coronavirusnovel coronavirus symptoms seem to be mostly focused on fever and cough but gastrointestinal symptoms should be a new focus for clinicians according to two new papers published online in gastroenterology jinyang gu et al describe how investigators from shanghai china sought to document the symptoms of the novel coronavirus although fever dry cough and dyspnea present in most cases they wanted to understand what impact the virus had on symptoms such as diarrhea nausea vomiting and abdominal discomfort so far those symptoms have varied among different study populations former studies on sars which is related to the coronavirus and can present with similar symptoms showed that sars was verified in patients after detection in biopsy specimens and stool this was true even after the patients had been discharged from the hospital the study authors noted that the first us patient admitted to a hospital with confirmed coronavirus had a loose bowel movement on hospital day two 19 labs in china have been able to isolate the live coronavirus from the stool of patients the authors said unpublished these factors brought the gastrointestinal tract to the forefront of investigators minds and suggest that clinicians should identify patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and carefully monitor those patients 24another similarity that may be noted between sars and covid-19 is that mild to moderate liver injury has existed in patients 25 xiao f et al examined the viral rna in feces from 71 patients with confirmed covid-19 during their hospitalization from february 1-14 2020 26 they collected serum nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs urine stool and tissues from endoscopy from the patients the age of the patients ranged from 10 months to 78 years the duration of positive stool tests ranged from 1 to 12 days they added and patients remained positive via stool tests after showing negative in respiratory samples the researchers found that 534 of patients had sars-cov-2 rna in their stool and 23 of patients tested positive in their stool despite testing negative for the virus in respiratory samples this finding indicates that viral gastrointestinal infection and the potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance in the respiratory tract the author strongly recommends that rrt-pcr testing for sars-cov-2 from feces should be performed routinely in sars-cov-2 patients and transmission-based precautions for hospitalized sars-cov-2 patients should continue if the feces tests positive by rrt-pcr testing table 1 provides a brief review of the study by yu he et al of covid-19 while table 2 summarizes all the included clinical studies to date 27-28discussionthis review included the latest studies from december 2019 to march 2019 to analyze the clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus new evidence supports the possibility of gastrointestinal infection with the sars-cov-2 as well as a possible fecal-oral route of transmission according to the results of studies published in gastroenterology currently a sars-cov-2 infection causes primarily a respiratory-based constellation of symptoms due to the respiratory nature of symptoms it has been hypothesized that the virus infects respiratory epithelial cells and is transmitted via respiratory droplets from human to human however viral target cells and organs have not been explicitly identified creating a significant gap in the current understanding of the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 and its transmission routes 24-26 moreover a recent case report detected sars-cov-2 viral rna in stool samples thus challenging these hypotheses therefore researchers examined stool samples obtained between february 1 and february 14 2020 from 73 patients hospitalized as a result of sars-cov-2 infection for viral rna results demonstrated that 5342 of these patients had positive samples for sars-cov-2 rna the samples remained positive for a range of one to 12 days of note 2329 of patients had positive stool samples after respiratory samples were negative for viral rna a study described one patient a man aged 78 years who was admitted to a hospital in guangdong province china on january 17 2020 rrt-pcr was positive for sars-cov-2 and the patient experienced 10 days of respiratory illness with the hallmarks of covid-19 on day 10 however he presented with coffee-ground gastric contents in his gastric drainage tube fecal occult blood testing indicated an upper gastrointestinal bleed subsequent endoscopy found mucosal damage to the esophagus and esophageal gastric duodenal and colonic samples were taken for testing hematoxylin and eosin staining showed no significant damage but numerous infiltrating plasma cells and lymphocytes as well as interstitial edema were seen in the lamina propria of the stomach duodenum and rectum most significantly results demonstrated positive ace2 protein staining mainly in the cytoplasm of gastrointestinal epithelial cells it has been previously shown that sars-cov-2 uses this protein as a viral receptor for its entry process immunofluorescence testing showed that ace2 was abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of the gastric duodenal and rectal epithelia of the above-mentioned patient as well as other patients these data demonstrated that infectious virions are being secreted from the gastrointestinal cells of people with sars-cov-2 infection and thus support the potential for fecal-oral transmission of the virus the discharge guideline depending on the respiratory tract test also meets the challengeinterestingly while the virus test of the nasopharyngeal swab switched from positive to negative after the treatment the rectal swab specimens still tested positive 29 these cases remind the clinicians that the rectal swab may be equally important to the pharyngeal swab even if the patient is asymptomatic which challenges the latest published guideline provided by national health commission of china that two successive negative respiratory tract tests are regarded as the standard for discharge and termination of compulsory isolation for covid-19 patients 30 famous well-described clusters of infection of sars in amoy gardens hong kong drew the attention of health officials on fomite transmission because two-thirds of the confirmed sars patients in amoy gardens had diarrhea 31 as findings showed that patients with sars could discharge sars-cov in their stool up to 73 days after symptom onset the stools with the virus became the resource of contamination of airdrops and a variety of environmental surfaces which may contribute to the clusters of infection 32 similarly evidence showed that sars-cov-2 were identified in four stool specimens four out of 62 so fomite transmission should not be ignored in the transmission of sars-cov-2 since the virus may move from the respiratory tract into the gastrointestinal tract the recovered patients may discharge the stool with the virus for a long time 33 according to a recently published report by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc of china community-acquired infections are becoming the predominant route in transmission 34 based on these cases and the lessons from sars rrt-pcr testing for sars-cov-2 from feces should be performed in sars-cov-2 patients before dischargeclinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms such as diarrhea may be a presenting feature of covid-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms rather than waiting for respiratory symptoms to emerge it should also be considered before discharge that viral gastrointestinal infection and potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance from the respiratory tractthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic continues to pose a significant threat to public health with more than three million cases reported globally including over 228000 deaths as of 30 april 2020 the causal agent is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and extensive public health measures are being deployed around the world to mitigate the spread of this virus 123456789 in the united kingdom initial interventions focused on preventing transmission from the individuals that were most likely to be infected 10 for example symptomatic individuals and their contacts as well as anyone who had visited severely affected areas were asked to self-isolate since these measures were not sufficient to prevent sustained transmission interventions have now intensified with all members of the public being asked to stay at home interventions are therefore no longer targeted specifically at individuals with a higher risk of having contracted the virus the routine public health measures that were implemented early in the covid-19 pandemic have been successful in the past for example the 2003 sars pandemic was eventually brought under control following a policy based on detection and isolation of symptomatic hosts and their contacts 11 one of the key factors determining the success of such measures during any infectious disease outbreak is the level of symptoms exhibited by individuals who are transmitting the pathogen 1213 the proportion of transmissions occurring prior to symptoms has been noted as particularly important 14 this is because individuals displaying few symptoms are harder to detect and isolate or treat effectively than those with clear disease-specific symptoms after infection by sars-cov-2 hosts develop mild symptoms initially such as a dry cough and fever followed by more serious symptoms such as breathing difficulties figure 1a see also 1516 initial symptoms tend not to be specific to covid-19 although for a limited number of patients gastrointestinal symptoms might be an early and distinct indicator of infection by sars-cov-2 17evidence is slowly accumulating about the relationship between covid-19 symptoms and the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 1418192021 it has become increasingly apparent that individuals can transmit the virus when they are not displaying clear symptoms 222324252627 a recent study by ferretti et al 14 distinguished between i symptomatic transmissions direct transmissions from individuals displaying clear symptoms ii presymptomatic transmissions direct transmissions before the source individual develops clear symptoms and iii asymptomatic transmissions direct transmissions from individuals who never develop clear symptoms in that study one of the key findings was that sars-cov-2 spreads too fast for containment by routine public health measures such as standard contact tracing and isolation of known infected hosts this is partly because of the significant proportion of transmissions occurring prior to clear symptoms developinghere we consider the earliest stages of the covid-19 pandemic and show that the proportion of infections arising from individuals with few symptoms including infected individuals with no symptoms at all is a quantity that changes during an outbreak in our initial analysis we consider the control of symptomatic hosts and estimate changes in the time period between symptom onset and hospitalisation using data for 212 patients who reported symptoms between 2 january 2020 and 22 january 2020 the period between symptom onset and hospitalisation reflects the time in which symptomatic hosts were potentially transmitting the virus in the community and is a proxy for the time period between individuals developing clear symptoms and being isolatedthen we turn our attention to infected individuals with few symptoms the proportion of transmissions occurring from hosts with few symptoms at the start of any outbreak is an important factor affecting the controllability and severity of the outbreak for a fixed value of the basic reproduction number there is a threshold value of the initial proportion of transmissions occurring from hosts with few symptoms if the initial proportion of transmissions occurring from hosts with few symptoms is above this threshold then the outbreak cannot be controlled by interventions targeting hosts exhibiting clear symptoms alonehowever as public health measures and public awareness have changed during the covid-19 pandemic the proportion of transmissions from hosts with few symptoms will have varied as we show changes in the period between symptom onset and hospitalisation lead to temporal variations in the proportion of transmissions occurring from hosts prior to clear symptom development consequently after the start of the pandemic a high proportion of transmissions from individuals with few symptoms is not always indicative of an uncontrollable outbreak instead it can show that some transmissions from infected individuals with clear symptoms are being prevented effectivelywe considered temporal changes in the time period from symptom onset to hospitalisation during the initial stages of the covid-19 pandemic we denote the expected time from symptom onset to hospitalisation for an individual developing clear symptoms on day t by 1t days where t is the rate of hospitalisation in our analysis the value t  0 days corresponds to 2 january 2020we estimated 1t using a publicly available line list dataset describing this period for 231 patients from around the world 28 implausible time periods negative values and periods longer than 30 days were assumed to be reported incorrectly and were excluded from the analysis there were 19 such patients so that our analysis was performed with data from 212 patients supplementary material table s1 of these 190 patients were from china and 22 were from other countrieswe used data for patients with dates of symptom onset up to 22 january 2020 ie t  20 days this is because when the analysis was performed on 9 february 2020 ie 18 days later it is unlikely that individuals symptomatic on 22 january 2020 would not yet have been hospitalised in the data used in our analysis only one patient was recorded as having a period between symptom onset and hospitalisation longer than 18 days if we had considered data from patients with later symptom onset dates than 22 january 2020 then right censoring may have occurred 293031 specifically we could have been preferentially including patients with short periods between symptom onset and hospitalisation in the analysis leading to underestimation of the symptomatic infectious period ie the part of the infectious period during which individuals display clear symptomsthe symptomatic infectious period was assumed to be the difference between the symptom onset and hospitalisation dates when symptom onset and hospitalisation occurred on the same day we assumed that the period between these times was equal to 05 days rather than 0 days since immediate hospitalisation is impossible locally estimated scatterplot smoothing loess with a span parameter of 075 and tricubic distance weighting the default settings in the r software package stats was used to estimate 1t all analyses in this manuscript were performed using r software version 361we define the time-varying reproduction number rt as the expected number of secondary infections over their entire course of infection generated by an individual who first shows clear symptoms on day t where t0 corresponds to 2 january 2020 3233343536 over the course of a coronavirus infection infected hosts tend to have few symptoms initially before potentially developing more clear symptoms figure 1a the time-varying reproduction number which we refer to as the reproduction number hereafter is the sum of the expected number of secondary infections when the individual has few symptoms and the expected number of secondary infections when that individual has clear symptoms the basic reproduction number r0 corresponds to the reproduction number at time t0in our analysis we considered changes in the reproduction number due to temporal variations in the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation alone the expected number of infections arising from the infectious period with few symptoms was assumed unchanged during the outbreak and is given by 0r0 where 0 represents the expected proportion of infections generated by infectious hosts in the period before clear symptoms near the beginning of the outbreak ie t  0 the expected number of infections arising from the symptomatic infectious period is then given by 10r01t10 where the factor 1t10 reflects the change in the symptomatic infectious period between the beginning of the period considered and time t consequently the reproduction number is given by
1rt0r010r01t10the proportion of transmissions occurring from infectious hosts with few symptoms ie the expected proportion of secondary infections generated by an infected host that arise before that host develops clear symptoms is a dynamic quantity that changes throughout the outbreak we denote this quantity by t an expression for t is derived by considering the ratio between the expected number of transmissions in the infectious period when there are few symptoms and the reproduction number2t0r00r010r01t1000101t10 we note that this final expression for t does not depend on the value of the basic reproduction number r0as described in the methods we considered how the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation changed in the initial stages of the covid-19 pandemic figure 1b the estimated mean value of this quantity changed from around 65 days in the period between 2 january and 14 january to a lower value of around 2 days by 22 january towards the end of the time period considered the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation appeared to be reducing more slowly than earlier in the time period considered this potentially indicates a limit to the ability of isolation measures to decrease the symptomatic infectious periodif the period from symptom onset to hospitalisation tends to decrease during an outbreak the expected number and proportion of transmissions from hosts displaying clear symptoms decreases in that case the reproduction number can be expected to decrease and the relative proportion of transmissions from individuals with few symptoms will increaseof particular interest is the threshold for outbreak control ie rt1 3235 for a single value of r0 there is a corresponding threshold value of 0 that determines whether or not the outbreak can ever be brought under control via the isolation of symptomatic hosts alone in particular in the impossible case in which symptomatic hosts are isolated perfectly and immediately so that 1t approaches zero days then equation 1 indicates that the threshold for outbreak control is achieved exactly if 01r0 consequently if 01r0 then in the absence of other effects eg acquired immunity as the pathogen infects individuals in the population any intervention that only involves control of hosts with clear symptoms will fail to bring rt1 and therefore will not bring the outbreak under controlsince perfect control of symptomatic infectious hosts is impossible to achieve in reality some values of 0 that are less than 1r0 are also likely to correspond to scenarios in which isolation of symptomatic hosts alone will fail to control the outbreak we explored this in the specific context of the range of symptomatic infectious periods shown in figure 1b for example when r02 figure 2a then any value for the proportion of transmissions from hosts with few symptoms on 2 january below 0027 will have seen rt reduce below 1 by 22 january 2020 if instead r03 figure 2b then isolation of hosts with clear symptoms was only able to reduce rt below 1 by 22 january 2020 if the proportion of transmissions from hosts with few symptoms was very low specifically 0003 for values of r032 even if no transmissions occur from hosts with few symptoms then rt would not have been reduced below 1 by 22 january 2020 given the reduction in the symptomatic infectious period shown in figure 1bif transmissions from hosts with clear symptoms could be eliminated completely then it might or might not have been possible to reduce rt below 1 without resorting to the current lockdowns in place in countries worldwide depending on the precise values of r0 and 0 in figure 2d we show the target period from symptom onset to hospitalisation ie the mean value of this period below which rt is less than one for pairs of values of r0 and 0 assuming that 1067 days as in figure 1b the calculation of the target period from symptom onset to hospitalisation for each pair of values simply involved rearranging equation 1 to find the critical value of 1t days corresponding to rt1 if r01 then the outbreak was already under control when t0 days and so there was no target period from symptom onset to hospitalisation bottom of figure 2d if 0 and r0 were both large then it would be impossible to bring rt1 by reducing the symptomatic infectious period alone top right of figure 2d in general if 0 and r0 were larger then the target period from symptom onset to hospitalisation for outbreak control would be shorterin this article we used data from early in the covid-19 pandemic to demonstrate that the proportion of transmissions arising from infectors with few symptoms changes during an outbreak we found that in the initial stage of the pandemic symptomatic hosts were hospitalisedisolated increasingly effectively figure 1b this is likely to be due to changes in public awareness about the outbreak as well as the introduction of containment measures eg contact tracing followed by isolation of secondary infected hosts the consequences of improved isolation of symptomatic hosts in the absence of changes to other factors are that the proportion of infections due to hosts with few symptoms is likely to have increased and the reproduction number is likely to have decreased figure 2acwe considered the impact of transmissions from infectors with few symptoms on the controllability of infectious disease outbreaks using covid-19 as a case study if symptomatic hosts can be isolated effectively then it may be possible to bring an outbreak under control figure 2a however this depends on the value of the basic reproduction number r0 and the initial proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms 0 if the values of r0 and 0 are both high then control of any outbreak by targeting symptomatic hosts alone is impossible top right region of figure 2d under this scenario other public health measures are necessary 13 for example strategies involving finding and isolating hosts with few symptoms eg tracing and testing of known contacts whether or not they are showing clear symptoms 2 or reducing transmission via large-scale interventions that are not focused on infectious hosts alone eg school closures workplace closures prevention of large-scale gatherings andor transport bans most of which are now in place for covid-19 in a number of countries worldwide 37we also found that temporal variations in the proportion of transmissions occurring from hosts with few symptoms are independent of the value of r0 as an example if the initial percentage of transmissions from individuals with few symptoms is 10 then equation 2 indicates that a 50 reduction in the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation would correspond to the proportion of transmissions from hosts with few symptoms increasing to 18 regardless of the value of r0in this study we developed a simple model that includes both transmissions from infected individuals with few symptoms and transmissions from infected individuals with clear symptoms our main goal was not to estimate temporal changes in rt and t during the covid-19 pandemic accounting for the wide range of factors affecting these quantities this would require analyses of different datasets and it is challenging to disentangle the effects of the many factors that affect transmissibility 323839 instead we considered the specific effect that increasingly efficient isolation of symptomatic hosts alone has on the values of rt and t we therefore focused on changes in the symptomatic infectious period however the model could be extended to account for additional features of emerging outbreaks as an example precisely what constitutes few symptoms and clear symptoms might change as an outbreak is ongoing for covid-19 initial symptoms are nonspecific consequently when case numbers were very low early in the pandemic an individual developing such symptoms may not have considered them to be indicative of infection by sars-cov-2 now that the number of cases has increased an individual might assume that nonspecific symptoms are an indicator of infection by sars-cov-2 and might self-isolate despite not having developed more obvious symptoms our assumption that the expected number of infections in the infectious period with few symptoms is unchanged during an outbreak could be amended to reflect thisas in previous studies we assumed that the period between symptom onset and hospitalisation is a proxy for the period between symptom onset and isolation 14 we could have made other assumptions about the symptomatic infectious periodfor example assuming that an infected host is isolated at the point that the sars-cov-2 infection is laboratory confirmed rather than at the time of the first medical visit whereas this would lead to a longer symptomatic infectious period than the value estimated here the opposite effect would be seen if individuals that self-isolated at home early in their infection were included in the analysis we also used a simple method to estimate the mean length of the period between symptom onset and hospitalisation namely loess one advantage of this approach is that it did not require a specific distribution for the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation to be chosen however we did assume that the period between symptom onset and hospitalisation was 05 days for individuals that developed symptoms and were hospitalised on the same day in theory other methods of parameter estimation could be used for example the period between symptom onset and hospitalisation could be estimated using markov chain monte carlo in shifting time windows throughout the outbreak this would have the advantage that interval-censored data could be specified for possible periods between symptom onset and hospitalisation for each host in the dataset rather than assuming a precise value see eg 13240 however this would involve assuming a parametric distribution or range of distributions characterising the symptomatic infectious period which was not necessary in our analysisdespite these simplifications our analysis has allowed us to demonstrate the principle that the proportion of transmissions from individuals with few symptoms is not a fixed quantity and has instead varied temporally during the covid-19 pandemic so far such changes are particularly likely early in an outbreak and whenever intervention strategies are altered the proportion of transmissions from individuals with few symptoms at the beginning of any outbreak can in theory be used along with the value of the basic reproduction number to predict whether or not an outbreak can be brought under control via isolation of symptomatic hosts alone if these quantities are known simultaneously at another point in time a similar assessment can be performed nonetheless whenever control of symptomatic hosts is enhanced the proportion of transmissions from individuals with few symptoms is expected to increasesince we began our analysis a range of values have been estimated for the proportion of transmissions occurring from individuals with few symptoms for covid-19 144142 for example ferretti et al 14 estimated a range of between one-third and one-half of transmissions occurring from presymptomatic infected individuals using data from 40 source-recipient pairs as our results show estimates of the proportion of transmissions occurring from individuals with few symptoms alone should not be used to assess whether or not an outbreak is controllable instead a thorough investigation like the one conducted by ferretti et al 14 is required to make that assessment the proportion of transmissions occurring from individuals with few symptoms might take a high value as a result of measures that have reduced transmission from hosts with clear symptoms this should be considered when interpreting estimates of the proportion of infections arising from individuals with few symptoms during the covid-19 pandemiccoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 due to a novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is now a global pandemic there are more than 15 million confirmed cases across almost every country in the world and at the time of writing early april 2020 there were close to 100000 recorded deaths1 the diagnosis of covid-19 can be challenging and like any disease entity a number of factors including disease stage disease prevalence patient profile and sample type and quality amongst other factors can influence diagnostic test performance in this review we outline the performance outcomes of key tests used to diagnose covid-19 and considerations that modulate performance safety of health-care workers collecting the samples laboratory safety aspects and experimental approaches such as detection of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath mass spectrometry studies of different sample types methods of signal amplification and utility of other novel approaches are not discussed herecountry-specific indications and criteria for testing have evolved rapidly and are being updated as information emerges and as the epidemic progresses these recommendations have been guided by the phase of the epidemic and available resources generally speaking testing for covid-19 currently should be considered in anyone with symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection upper or lower and with or without systemic symptoms such as fever fatigue and myalgia25 in mild disease testing directs the need for self-isolation and identification of new cases through contact tracing and testing of contacts as the epidemic progresses and with forecasted limited testing capacity testing may be directed to specific subgroups or those with enhanced risk of a poor outcomein the clinical setting covid-19 will form part of the differential diagnosis of any acute respiratory presentation including infectious causes of pneumonia eg bacterial influenza other viral pneumonia pneumocystis pneumonia tuberculosis tb acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd acute pulmonary embolism cardiac failure and other conditions relevant investigations will depend on the clinical context and will likely include pulmonary imaging relevant laboratory investigations blood cultures and interrogation of urine andor lower respiratory tract specimens to rule in a viral mycobacterial fungal andor a bacterial cause clinical and laboratory parameters that may suggest viral infection may include pyrexia acute malaise and myalgia and lymphopenia c reactive protein crp is unhelpful in distinguishing covid-19 from other infections procalcitonin is elevated in severe covid-19 and when there is secondary bacterial infection67 in early disease procalcitonin may distinguish covid-19 from bacterial infections but not from other viral diseases data are awaited to confirm this supposition in those with underlying asthma or copd the presence of pulmonary infiltrates may favour a respiratory infection-related cause though a cardiac cause must also be considered in the differentialthe most common sample types sent for testing usually by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr are nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples obtained with a swab placed in viral transport medium there is already considerable shortage of reagents and swabs meaning that dry swabs are being sent to the laboratory in some centres dry swabs are less costly and more conducive to community-based testing but data are urgently required to determine the comparative sensitivity of dry swabs compared to using viral transport medium taking into account the time from sample acquisition to sample processing samples from the lower respiratory tract including sputum tracheal aspirate bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar lavage may also be sent in patients with covid-19 disease samples from the lower respiratory tract are more likely to test positive discussed below viral rna can also be detected in stool in 30 of cases and in blood in 1 of cases 8 but rarely in urinerecent data from infections in special contexts such as cruise liners9 and in close contacts of covid-19 patients 10 have demonstrated that sars-cov-2-specific rt-pcr may be positive in the early phase of the disease and that viral shedding in the asymptomatic phase and in the early prodromal phase can be considerable1112 at present screening of asymptomatic individuals by rt-pcr has been constrained by limited testing capacity and the need to focus on public health efforts and resources on symptomatic personsin symptomatic individuals 8090 of patients have mild symptoms not requiring hospitalisation depending on age and the presence of risk factors 1020 of symptomatic persons may require admission to hospital because of respiratory or other complications individuals in this enhanced risk category may have one or more risk factors including age greater than 50 years comorbidities history of significant tobacco smoking and underlying immunocompromising illnesses1013 in mild disease especially in the early stages the rt-pcr false negative rate is 304081415 a meta-analysis reported that a single test 10 days post symptom development had a 33 false negative rate using a nasopharyngeal swab 5289 for a throat swab16 ai et al reported a false negative rate of 41 in a cohort of 1014 hospitalised patients the estimated median interval between the initial negative test and subsequent positive rt-pcr result was 51  15 days17 a selection of other studies reported false negative rates of between 3 and 291820 notably some patients required up to five repeat tests before a positive result was ascertained19 this false negativity phenomenon may be due to several factors including a low viral load below the detection limit of the assay low sample volume or cellular mass during acquisition sampling location upper versus lower respiratory tract sample degradation during transport or storage sample processing methodology and the timing of sampling in relation to the stage of the disease rt-pcr positivity may progressively increase during the course of the disease14test accuracy will depend on the quality of the specimen collected20 it has since been shown that specimens from the lower respiratory tract have a higher viral load and hence more likely to test positive than specimens from the upper respiratory tract821 nasopharyngeal specimens have better yield compared to oropharyngeal samples815 in hospitalised patients with severe disease wang et al found a sensitivity of 93 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 72 in sputum and 63 in nasal swabs sensitivity ranged from 0 to 32 in pharyngeal swabs faeces blood and urine8 given these considerations a negative test from an upper respiratory tract specimen should be repeated after 13 days the optimal timing is unclear or a lower respiratory tract specimen obtained to exclude a false negative result if clinical suspicion is high22viral shedding in asymptomatic early prodromal minimally symptomatic individuals and after resolution of symptoms all help us to explain the rapid and extensive spread of covid-19 in patients with more severe diseases including those with lower respiratory tract infection but also in individuals with mild disease high viral loads can be detected often for several days after the resolution of symptoms23 the significance of this remains unclear though recent data from a limited number of patients suggest that rt-pcr positivity does not necessarily mean shedding of infectious virus after symptom resolution11 zhifeng et al demonstrated that rt-pcr using nasopharyngeal samples can be negative even when there is ct scan evidence of covid-19 pneumonia24 ali et al showed an improvement in disease extent in 42 of ct scans prior to rt-pcr tests becoming negative17 it is unclear whether patients whose symptoms have resolved but who continue to have detectable viral rna in respiratory samples can transmit infection furthermore when symptoms have resolved and especially given limited testing capacity it remains unclear when patients may be discharged from icu into the general ward setting or from hospital into the community setting especially if there are other individuals with high-risk profiles living in the same household thus there are no clearly defined guidelines about when it is safe for social mixing to occur after symptoms have resolved health-care workers safety must be taken into account when collecting sputum and should ideally be performed in an infection-controlled environment or in the open air in ambulant patientscurrently rt-pcr is the imperfect gold standard for the diagnosis of covid-19 the development of molecular detection assays has been facilitated by the sequencing of sars-cov-225 the assay consists of two principal steps i viral rna extraction from patient specimens performed manually or using automated platforms and ii reverse transcription and pcr amplification using specific primers and specific probes for real-time detection see figure 1 for an overview the use of robotic systems allows for increased throughput for rna extraction and pcr set-up because of current resource constraints trained personnel and reagents and the necessity to rapidly deliver test outcomes most diagnostic laboratories are skipping the post-extraction rna quality and quantification check which is costly and labour-intensiveseveral sars-cov-2 targets are being used and these include the envelope e nucleocapsid n rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp genes and two large open reading frames orf1aorf1b and rnase p4 generally at least two target genes need to be identified for sars-cov-2 confirmation however interpretation algorithms differ with respect to the number of genes that need to be detected for the test to be considered positive for some protocols results are interpreted as indeterminate or negative if one of the genes is not detected whereas for others identification of one gene is used as screening test while that of the subsequent genes serves as a confirmatory test4 from a laboratory perspective multiplexing of targets allows for better efficiency shorter turn-around times and more optimal management of laboratory consumables26 vogel et al evaluated nine primerprobe sets27 they confirmed that each pair had a detection efficiency of 90 but there were differences in the ability to differentiate true negatives from positives in patients with a low viral load some sets led to inconclusive results due to non-specific background amplification including the initial sets issued by the usa cdc but with subsequent rectification with viral evolution nucleotide substitutions may emerge that could affect primerprobe binding regions that could alter the sensitivity of pcr indeed a potentially problematic mismatch in the rdrp-sarsr reverse primer has already been confirmed threshold cycle ct value of the target gene remains the quantitative end point to ascertain viral load and depending on the kit used this value generally lies in the 3040 range427 to control for non-specific pcr inhibition an internal positive amplification control eg sars-cov-2 e-gene rna sars-cov frankfurt 1 rna is included in the assay whilst a negative control interrogates for contamination during sample preparationdigital pcr dpcr was used to perform a quality assurance verification of rt-pcr28 dpcr involves partitioning a sample into many individual parallel pcr reactions allowing even a single molecule to be amplified more than a million-fold using this technique sensitivity was significantly improved from 282 by rt-pcr to 874 by rt-dpcr28 moreover 1516 close contacts that were inconclusive with conventional rt-pcr likely because not all the targets of interest were detected were dpcr positive the overall sensitivity specificity and diagnostic accuracy of rt-dpcr was 90 100 and 93 respectively moreover the higher sensitivity of rt-dpcr translated into detection of viral rna for longer periods compared to conventional rt-pcr in convalescing patients while rt-dpcr is more sensitive and suitable for detecting low viral loads its accessibility is limited by the complexity of the system cost implications and the inability to multiplex target genes of interest29several automated rapid nucleic acid amplification tests have recently received fda approval for emergency use cepheids xpert xpress sars-cov-2 run on the gene xpert platform detects multiple gene targets and can provide a result within 45 min30 abbotts rapid covid-19 test run on the abbott id now device can provide results within 13 min31 the former may be convenient in some countries like south africa that have an extensive gene xpert infrastructure and the technology lends itself to onsite point-of-care testing using portable xpert platforms like xpert edgewhile rt-pcr currently remains the imperfect gold standard for the rapid confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection ongoing genetic evolution of the virus highlights the need to closely monitor and review the methodology based on emerging data it is possible that a better stage-specific reference standard may emerge incorporating immunoassay resultslimited testing capacity remains a challenge to widespread surveillance and testing in south africa expanding testing services to research-based laboratories is fraught with challenges including the need for accreditation of laboratories sanas in south africa and personnel hpcsa in south africa capacity shortfalls are further compounded by an international and country-wide shortage of kits and reagents and severe reduction in international freight shipping capacity however the implementation of rapid automated molecular testing xpert xpress sars-cov-2 will be helpful if enough cartridges can be procuredseveral antigen-based immunoassays have been developed that detect antibodies in serum or plasma32 one such assay was recently fda approved and the foundation for innovative new diagnostics website lists over 200 companies that are either making or have made such assays33 some are rapid lateral flow assay lfa based while others are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa-like tests both formats have antigen impregnated on a test line or on a plastic-plate surface and detect human igg or igm and sometimes also iga antibodies in the meanwhile rapid capture assays that detect viral antigens in nasopharyngeal aspirates have also been developed and are being evaluated in tandemdespite the proliferation of different testing devices and kits that are emerging there are hardly any independent validation data on which specific assays work optimally therefore the sensitivity specificity and predictive values of individual tests in different contexts remain unknown a web-based resource has been developed that lists assays that have now been approved for use in specific countries34 some tests purchased by specific countries have already been found not to meet expectations35 in spain one of worst hit european nations health authorities purchased thousands of rapid serological tests from a biotech company in china but these were later found to have a sensitivity of 3036 south african companies have already produced iterations of lfa platforms and they are currently being evaluatedone concern is test specificity as there are four common human coronaviruses that cause up to a third of common cold episodes poorly designed antibody tests may cross-react with pre-existing anti-coronavirus antibodies high false positivity rates may erroneously indicate disease in those without covid-19 resulting in wasted public health contact tracing efforts unnecessary anxiety and even worse unintended exposure of individuals to covid-19 in testing centres and wards if they are hospitalised suboptimal sensitivity with lfa formats without a signal amplification step is a potential concern as often lfa depending on the context may have suboptimal sensitivity compared to elisa-based assays however to what extent this applies to covid-19 remains to be seenseveral recent papers describe longitudinal antibody responses in patients with covid193740 broadly speaking igm responses tend to become detectable 37 days after the onset of symptoms3941 robust responses generally develop during the second week of illness3738 given these considerations antibody-based tests are not recommended to be used for first line diagnosis within the first few days of symptoms there is some evidence that combining antibody and rt-pcr data during the early phase of disease may be useful and may have some incremental benefit though further studies are required however the south african health product regulatory agency and other agencies have recently indicated based on guidance from the south african national institute of communicable diseases and the who that serological testing is not suitable for diagnosis of acute sars-cov-2 infection and should be limited to epidemiological surveys at least until more data becomes availableindeed there is an undisputed role for immunoassays in surveillance studies which may guide public health planning and to define the trajectory of the epidemic their potential role for targeting vaccination in certain subgroups is being investigated some have suggested that immunoassays could identify previously infected and recovered health-care workers and other essential workers who could potentially return to work with the assumption that they are immune to reinfection whether this is the case and for how long immunity lasts with covid-19 remains unclear thus the validity of the concept of immunity passports remains unclear42there are currently no data on how diagnostic management and prognostic considerations may be different in hiv-infected versus uninfected persons in hiv-infected patients presenting with a respiratory tract infection the general possibilities outlined above have to be considered including considering pcp and tb in the differential diagnosis although well documented it is not widely appreciated that between 10 and 20 of community-acquired pneumonia or acute lower respiratory tract infection in sub-saharan africa and parts of asia is due to mycobacterium tuberculosis4345 and this proportion is even higher in hiv-infected persons4345 it is also possible that covid-19 infection may unmask sub-clinical tb in both hiv-infected or uninfected persons on the other hand and particularly in hiv-infected persons covid-19 pneumonia like in the case of influenza45 may be associated with a poorer prognosis in hospitalised patients with tb whether sars-cov-2 viral load will be higher in hiv-infected persons and therefore rt-pcr sensitivity better remains unclear in hiv-uninfected persons co-infection with more than one pathogen has already been documented eg co-infection with covid-19 and influenza andor bacterial organisms46 it is possible that co-infection with more than one pathogen may be more frequent in hiv-infected persons or those with advanced immunosuppression these unanswered questions will only be resolved once more data become availablethe rapidly spreading covid-19 pandemic has exposed capacity weaknesses in health-care and laboratory testing systems although the mainstay of testing remains rt-pcr there are several drawbacks including a significant false negative rate in the early course of the disease assay cost and lack of assay simplicity and the requirement for complex laboratory infrastructure there is an emerging shortage of reagents including rna extraction kits that is likely to worsen already many centres are using dry nasopharyngeal swabs because of the shortage of viral transport medium antibody-based immunoassays have been developed although they have a limited role in the early diagnosis of symptomatic patients their incremental benefit over rt-pcr assays and their role in other applications including surveillance and targeting individuals for vaccination and redeployment into the workforce are under investigationthe literature reports that each year up to 25 million people in the us visit their doctor because of respiratory tract infections the upper respiratory tract infections better known as common colds are the most common clinical presentation of said infections gonzales et al 2001 viral lower respiratory tract infections bronchitis bronchiolitis and pneumonia eg with respiratory syncytial virus rsv or influenza are generally more common in infants young children and in patients with chronic medical conditions whereas older children and healthy adults usually suffer from milder upper respiratory tract infections eccles 2005 common cold was the third most common diagnosis made during ambulatory care visits by patients of all ages in the us hsiao et al 2010 it has been estimated that an average adult suffers from 2 to 4 colds per year and a schoolchild suffers from 6 to 10 colds per year spector 1995 johnston and holgate 1996 winther et al 1998 eccles 2005 therefore respiratory tract infections represent a significant clinical and therapeutic problem and an economic burden wat 2004 upper respiratory tract infections are generally mild self-limiting and viral in their origin johnston and holgate 1996 snow et al 2001 turner 2011 kennedy et al 2012 in experimental studies the infections have been defined as a short mild illness with the early symptoms being headaches chills sneezing and a sore throat and delayed symptoms being nasal obstruction or discharge cough and malaise jackson et al 1958 the duration of symptoms varies from 7 to 10 days with a peak occurring on the 23rd day however some symptoms may be observed up to 3 weeks after the onset of the infection heikkinen and jrvinen 2003 eccles 2005 common colds are triggered by rhinovirus rv coronavirus influenza and parainfluenza viruses and rsv wat 2004 eccles 2005 kennedy et al 2012 the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections is based on symptoms and with the exception of antivirals which may be used in influenza treatment remains symptomatic studies on different viruses responsible for the upper respiratory tract infections have shown that it is not possible to identify the virus based on the symptoms johnston and holgate 1996 eccles 2002 not only is the clinical presentation of these infections similar regardless of their etiology but the order in which the symptoms develop is also similar if the etiology of infections cannot be determined on the basis of clinical symptoms the host reaction must play a major role in their pathogenesis the similarities in the clinical presentation of viral upper respiratory tract infections stems from the same immune response pattern to different etiologic agents eccles 2005 furthermore in acute respiratory tract infections a routine diagnosis to determine the etiology is not usually carried out in primary care settingsadvances in molecular biology help explain the mechanisms that generate the symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections nevertheless the practical use of the pathophysiology of common symptoms seems relatively poor compared with the amount of scientific knowledge availableclinical manifestations of respiratory tract infections are familiar and well-known eccles 2005 turner 2011 although the symptomatology depends to some extent on the type and location eg pharyngitis rhinitis sinusitis and bronchitis the etiology of respiratory infection viral or bacterial patients age general health co-morbidities immunity and on whether the infection is primary or secondary eg in rsv or influenza there is a great amount of variation and overlap in both etiology and symptoms of individual infections consequently even defining the exact syndrome like common cold or influenza-like morbidity is difficult and problematic eccles 2005the most significant signs of viral respiratory tract infections include sneezing rhinorrhea runny nose and nasal discharge nasal congestion cough tachypnea and fever subjective symptoms include a sore throat malaise shivering chills shortness of breath muscle aches and weakness fatigue and a loss of appetite and headaches snow et al 2001 wat 2004 eccles 2005 kennedy et al 2012 febrile seizures are a rare but important symptom in young children up to 6 years of age schuchmann et al 2011 symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections have been traditionally classified as early or late jackson et al 1958 eccles 2005 the early symptoms are those that develop quickly and resolve rapidly after 12 days like headaches sneezing chills sore throat and malaise in children a high fever may be observed complicated by seizures in some cases monto et al 2000 schuchmann et al 2011 late symptoms include nasal discharge nasal obstruction and cough the later symptoms develop over several days and are present one week after experimental infection jackson et al 1958 eccles 2005 the development of sneezing before coughing in patients with a common cold may be partly explained by the involvement of the upper airways first and the infection subsequent spread to the lower respiratory tract eccles 2005the aim of this review is to discuss the pathophysiology of symptoms of respiratory tract infections we focused on the most significant symptoms of acute viral respiratory infections sneezing nasal discharge and obstruction sore throat coughing muscle pains malaise and mood changes fever and febrile seizures in children we believe that despite a high prevalence of the symptoms their pathogenesis is not widely known and a better understanding should have a beneficial effect on the therapeutic approach and should improve the quality of patient carewe searched the literature to identify relevant data medline scopus web of science cochrane databases and respiratory-specific journals such as respiratory physiology  neurobiology american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine thorax chest journal of allergy asthma and clinical immunology european respiratory journal american journal of respiratory cell

respiratory medicine respiratory research seminars in respiratory critical care medicine and lancet infectious diseases were searched with the following key words pathophys or pathogen and resp symptom or resp infection or common cold from january 1990 through may 2014 if possible the results of the search were sorted according to relevance due to a large number of articles exceeding 20000 eg pubmed only the first 250 were analyzed references from relevant articles were also identified studies were included if they met the following two criteria published in english and containing valid consistent and relevant data the first two authors of the present review independently assessed all titles and abstracts to determine whether the inclusion criteria were satisfied if either of the assessors considered the abstract potentially suitable full-text articles were retrieved and then assessed by both assessors for their suitability for inclusion eventually 129 publications were selected and studied by each of the authors before the manuscript was preparedrhinoviruses are the most common etiologic agents of common cold they are responsible for one-third to half of all upper respiratory tract infections reported in adults annually proud et al 1990 hendley 1998 heikkinen and jrvinen 2003 ruuskanen et al 2013 improved knowledge about the structure and function of rhinoviruses has been acquired in recent years using virus culture techniques and new molecular genetics methods available currently more than 100 serotypes have been identified with hrv-a and hrv-b being the most important of them all heymann et al 2005 peltola et al 2008 bochkov et al 2011 kennedy et al 2012 it has been demonstrated that the pathomechanism of symptoms in rhinoviral respiratory tract infections does not result from the cell damage unlike influenza virus or rsv action winther et al 1990 rather rhinovirus disrupts the tight junctions of the epithelial barrier which facilitates the translocation of pathogens and stimulates the hosts innate and adaptive immune responses rezaee et al 2011 kennedy et al 2012 over 90  of rhinovirus serotypes enter the nasal epithelial cells through the host receptor with the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 icam-1 being a glycoprotein immunoglobulin expressed on non-ciliated epithelial cells and on the basal surface of the ciliated epithelium of nasopharyngeal mucosa while only around ten rhinovirus serotypes use a minor group of receptors low-density lipoprotein ldl bardin et al 1994 winther et al 1997 whiteman et al 2003 bella and rossmann 2000 vlasak et al 2005 kennedy et al 2012 newly discovered and sequenced human rhinovirus-c hrv-c is somehow unique as the virus isolates do not grow in typically used cell cultures eg embryonic lung fibroblasts in vitro growth of hrv-c was successfully performed using the sinus mucosal tissue as a substrate bochkov et al 2011 kennedy et al 2012 furthermore studies on the structure and function of hrv-c have shown that the virus enters the cells using neither the icam-1 nor ldl receptor and the pathomechanism of the hrv-c infection remains unclear arden and mackay 2010 simmonds et al 2010 bochkov and gern 2012 lee et al 2012 ruuskanen et al 2013in otherwise healthy individuals rhinovirus infections are generally limited to the upper respiratory tract with rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction being the most prominent symptoms kennedy et al 2012 entry of the rhinovirus triggers the release of interleukin-8 il-8 a major cytokine in the recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells hendley 1998 il-8 which is produced locally increases the production of nasal secretions and causes an influx of neutrophils douglass et al 1994 oxidative stress caused by viral infection is probably responsible for the cellular mechanisms that lead to the production and release of il-8 zhu et al 1997 studies of volunteers infected with a rhinovirus show a local infection in a small proportion 12  of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells turner et al 1982 bardin et al 1994 arruda et al 1995 the higher the nasopharyngeal viral load the more severe is the disease esposito et al 2014 vasoactive kinin peptides are other important mediators produced on-site in nasal mucosa and submucosa in rhinovirus-infected humans kinins released in the nose following plasma exudation increase the symptoms of rhinoviral infection and cause an increase in vascular permeability vasodilatation and glandular secretion bradykinin applied to the nasal mucosa causes symptoms that mimic the common cold including rhinitis nasal obstruction and sore throat proud et al 1988 1990 symptom scores correlate with an increase in the kinin concentration while nasal secretion in adults with symptomatic experimentally-induced rhinovirus infection contain significantly higher concentrations of bradykinin and lysyl-bradykinin asymptomatic infections do not result in increased kinin concentrations naclerio et al 1988 interestingly the presence of rhinovirus has been detected by rt-pcr in 20  of asymptomatic people who had an infected family member jartti et al 2008the coronavirus cov is the second etiologic agent of upper respiratory tract infections eccles 2005 mesel-lemoine et al 2012 the most common human-infecting coronaviruses include 229e oc43 sars-cov and the recently discovered nl63 and hku1 arden et al 2005 esper et al 2005 vabret et al 2005 pyrc et al 2007 the virus is transmitted by aerosol inhalation and reinfections often occur due to a short-lived immunity callow et al 1990 wat 2004 as a result coronavirus accounts for 1530  of upper respiratory tract infections in humans these infections are limited predominantly to the upper respiratory tract and rarely spread to lower airways and lungs mesel-lemoine et al 2012 the coronavirus infection can occasionally involve other organs arbour et al 2000 collins 2002 desforges et al 2006 it has been reported that the two new members of the coronavirus family nl63 and hku1 especially the nl63 could also trigger severe lower respiratory tract infections and abdominal disorders such as pain and diarrhea arden et al 2005 esper et al 2005 vabret et al 2005 pyrc et al 2007 epidemics caused by cov-nl63 and cov-hku1 have been observed every 23 years kahn 2006 jartti et al 2012 studies have confirmed that the infection with cov-nl63 is associated with croup and acute respiratory disease mostly in children the elderly and patients with chronic diseases with some fatal cases being reported van der hoek et al 2005 han et al 2007 wu et al 2008 oosterhof et al 2010 sung et al 2010 milewska et al 2013 the growth of coronaviruses using standard tissue cultures is poor and advanced molecular methods are needed to isolate the virus so that most infections may remain undiagnosed walsh et al 2013 human aminopeptidase n hapn a zinc-binding protein with endopeptidase activity is used by cov-229e for entry into the epithelial cells whereas cov-oc43 uses hemagglutinin-esterase he and spike s  its own surface glycoproteins  to enter the cell tyrrell et al 1993 knkel and herrler 1996 wat 2004 recent studies have shown the ability of cov-229e to destroy the dendritic cells which are essential components of the respiratory tracts immune system which may explain multiple reinfections with the same type of cov mesel-lemoine et al 2012 although the pathogenesis of infection caused by the two main groups of cov  229e and oc43  is different the clinical symptomatology is similar tyrrell et al 1993 wat 2004respiratory syncytial virus rsv is responsible for many flu-like illnesses zambon et al 2001 rsv replication starts in the nasopharynx and then the virus infects the bronchiolar epithelium presumably by cell-to-cell spread or aspiration of secretions the virus spares the basal cells and subsequently extends to the alveolar pneumocytes the pathologic findings of rsv are characterized by necrosis of epithelial cells infiltration with t cells and monocytes around arterioles and with neutrophils between the vascular structures and small airways johnson et al 2007 this leads to airway obstruction air trapping increased airway resistance and is also associated with neutrophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage everard et al 1994 rsv has never been isolated from blood peebles and graham 2005 the immune response to rsv especially cytokines and chemokines seems to be responsible for the symptoms and severity of bronchiolitis garofalo et al 2001 legg et al 2003 the cytokines il-8 il-6 tnf-alpha and il-1 beta were detected in respiratory secretions from infected children and high il-6 concentrations are associated with severe manifestations of the disease matsuda et al 1995 noah et al 1995 smyth et al 1997 respiratory secretions from infected children contain chemokines expressed and secreted by t-cells chemokine ligand 3  ccl3 ie macrophage inflammatory protein-1  mip-1 alpha chemokine ligand 2  ccl2 ie monocyte chemoattractant protein-1  mcp-1 chemokine ligand 11  ccl11  eotaxin and chemokine ligand 5  ccl5 ie rantes regulated on activation mip-1 alpha and to a lesser extent other beta-chemokines primarily secreted by activated immune cells are associated with severe manifestations of the disease noah et al 1995 welliver et al 2002 garofalo et al 2005 experimental infection of explanted polarized respiratory epithelium in tissue culture generates il-8 and ccl5 mellow et al 2004 nonetheless it is unknown whether the cytokines and chemokines are the cause of disease or are by-products of enhanced inflammatory responses barr and graham 2014whether respiratory tract infections caused by influenza viruses present as common colds with typical symptoms or as severe lower respiratory tract diseases depends on the type of virus pre-existing immunity the patients underlying disorders and multiple other factors wat 2004 the phenomena such as antigenic shift or drift have led to the formation of more recent and increasingly virulent variations of the influenza virus and consequently to more serious clinical manifestations gething et al 1980 treanor 2004 as an example pandemic influenza ah1n1pdm09 affected all age groups but it was more prevalent in younger patients and children in whom there was the highest rate of hospitalization and pneumonia kuchar et al 2013 it has previously been shown that coughing and fever are the best predictive factors of influenza infections having a positive predictive value ppv of 79  monto et al 2000 however neither symptom is sufficiently predictive in children aged 14 ohmit and monto 2006 overall influenza viruses are generally responsible for 515  of acute upper respiratory tract infections in humans wat 2004 the influenza virus causes damage to the epithelial cells and its replication occurs in the airways with predilection to the lower respiratory tract hers and mulder 1961 hers 1966 wat 2004 the two main glycoproteins of the influenza virus surface  hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na  play an essential role in the infection spread ha targets cells for infection binding to the epithelial sialylated glycans specific for upper or lower airways shinya et al 2006 de wit et al 2010 fukuyama and kawaoka 2011 while na is responsible for effective viral replication pappas et al 2008 another viral protein nonstructural protein 1 ns1 is also important due to its counteracting ifn- production in infected cells fukuyama and kawaoka 2011 viral replication is possible in host cells due to activation of nuclear factor kappa b nf-b and the rafmekerk cascade and then proinflammatory cytokines are produced with interleukin 6 il-6 being the most important of them kaiser et al 2001 pinto et al 2011 wine and alper 2012 il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf- interferon- ifn- il-8 and il-1 increase significantly in response to the viral invasion resulting in the development of fever nasopharyngeal mucous production and respiratory and systemic symptoms viral replication and the intensity of the main influenza symptoms are correlated with the level of cytokines particularly with il-6 and tnf- hayden et al 1998 kaiser et al 2001a sore throat irritation and pain in the pharynx usually appear at the beginning of a respiratory tract infection a sore throat is most likely caused by the action of prostaglandins and bradykinin on sensory nerve endings in the upper respiratory tract intranasal administration of bradykinin causes symptoms of rhinitis and a sore throat so it is likely to be responsible for these symptoms rees and eccles 1994 proud 1998 the sensation of pain is mediated by the cranial nerves supplying the nasopharynx similar symptoms have been observed in bacterial upper respiratory tract infections pharyngitis and tonsillitis georgitis 1993nasal congestion is a subsequent symptom of respiratory infection that develops over the first week of symptoms tyrrell et al 1993 the mechanism of nasal congestion relies on the dilation of the venous sinuses in the nasal epithelium in response to the vasodilator mediators such as bradykinin proud et al 1990 widdicombe 1997 symptom scores increase as kinin concentrations rise proud et al 1990 dilatation of the sinuses in the narrow nasal valve region causes obstruction of the nasal airway eccles 2000b the so-called nasal cycle alternating congestion and decongestion of the nasal passages controlled by the sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves is accentuated and the asymmetry of nasal airflow is more pronounced during respiratory infection eccles et al 1996a watery nasal secretion often accompanied by sneezing is an early symptom of a respiratory tract infection nasal discharge in respiratory infections is a complex mixture of plasma and glandular exudates with cellular elements eg goblet cells plasma cells and neutrophils of variable composition that changes over the course of the infection and severity of the inflammatory response eccles 1983 the first phase of nasal discharge consists of a glandular secretion reflex caused by stimulation of the upper airways trigeminal nerves studies have demonstrated that intranasal administration of ipratropium inhibits nasal secretions in the first 4 days of a common cold eg when it is caused by coronavirus akerlund et al 1993 hayden et al 1996 the color of the nasal discharge may change from watery clear to yellow and green during the course of the respiratory tract infection and this reflects the severity of the inflammatory response rather than the etiology of the infection stockley et al 2001 the green or yellow color of nasal discharge is often regarded as a clinical marker of bacterial superinfection and clinical indication to antibiotic treatment but there is no evidence that supports this concept murray et al 2000 the color change is related to the recruitment of leukocytes into the airway lumen stockley et al 2001 neutrophils and activated monocytes contain chromatic green granules azurophil granules containing myeloperoxidase with heme pigment the more leukocytes present in nasal discharge the more colorful the nasal discharge appears stockley et al 2001 although the literature is related to sputum color changes the same mechanisms apply to nasal dischargea watery nasal secretion in the infections early stage is often accompanied by sneezing sneezing together with a sore throat are the early symptoms of respiratory tract infections sneezing is a reflex mediated by the trigeminal nerves which supply the nasal epithelium leung and robson 1994 eccles 2005 the sneeze center in the brainstem coordinates the sneeze reflex sneezing is related to inflammatory responses in the nose and nasopharynx that stimulate the trigeminal nerves eccles 2005 as intranasal administration of histamine causes sneezing sneezing is probably mediated by histamine receptors on the trigeminal nerves mygind et al 1983 eccles 2005coughing is the most common clinical symptom and the most frequent reason for visits to see a doctor mcgarvey and morice 2006 coughing is a protective reflex that prevents the aspiration of food and fluids into the airway and cleans the respiratory tract of mucus and other foreign bodies the reflex is mediated exclusively by the vagus nerve eccles 2005 coughing is initiated in the airway through stimulation of the sensory nerves in the larynx or below widdicombe 1995 the airway inflammation associated with rhinitis must reach the larynx to cause coughing the external ear and esophagus are also supplied by the vagus nerve and coughing can also be triggered by gastroesophageal reflux morice 2002 respiratory tract infections are often accompanied by redundant dry and unproductive coughing in the first days the unproductive coughing may be caused by the inflammatory process spreading to the larynx since nasal inflammation causes sneezing rather than coughing coughing in respiratory tract infections is believed to be mediated by hyper-reactivity of the cough reflex due to the effects of inflammatory mediators on the airways sensory nerve endings lee et al 2002 eccles and lee 2004 when the larynx is inflamed and hyper-reactive coughing may occur spontaneously or in response to stimuli that would not normally cause coughing eg cold air it may persist for three weeks or longer some coughs may be voluntary and related to airway irritation lee et al 2002 productive coughing usually occurs later in the course of respiratory tract infection and is related to the mucus production associated with inflammation of the lower airways eccles 2005 rhinovirus and coronavirus do not usually cause significant damage to the airway cells and the common cold is typically associated with little if any coughing while the influenza virus may cause substantial cellular damage to the respiratory epithelium and an influenza infection is usually associated with coughing monto et al 2000respiratory tract infections are associated with impaired psychomotor function smith et al 1998 mood changes and malaise may be explained by the unpleasant objective symptoms of respiratory tract infections such as nasal congestion rhinorrhea and coughing eccles 2005 these symptoms may cause discomfort and lower the patients quality of life however there is increasing evidence that mood changes may also be caused by the effects of cytokines on the central nervous system mahoney and ball 2002 interferon alpha treatment for chronic hepatitis b and c is associated with flu-like adverse effects similar to those observed in respiratory tract infections malaise fever myalgia and mood changes schaefer et al 2002 psychiatric adverse effects such as depression irritability impaired concentration and psychoses have been reported with interferon alpha therapy it has been reported that cytokines eg tumor necrosis factor- tnf- and interleukins 1 2 and 6 cause mood changes with anhedonia cognitive dysfunction anxiety irritability psychomotor slowing fatigue anorexia sleep alterations and a lower pain threshold capuron and miller 2004 the production of these cytokines is also associated with respiratory tract infections which may mediate mood changes associated with these infections the exact mechanisms of cytokine action in the brain are poorly understood but there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that anorexia associated with respiratory infections is mediated by cytokines that act directly on the feeding center in the hypothalamus langhans 2000headaches are a common early symptom of respiratory tract infections the majority 60  of patients with respiratory tract infections with a sore throat reported headaches in a clinical trial eccles et al 2003 the mechanism of a headache associated with a respiratory tract infection is unknown but headaches may be triggered by cytokines released in response to a viral infection smith 1992 it has been shown that the administration of some cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interferons cause headaches smith 1992 gold et al 2005 van zonneveld et al 2005myalgia is a common symptom of respiratory tract infections around half of patients with a common cold complain about muscle pain eccles et al 2003 eccles 2005 myalgia occurs in the acute immune response to infection phase and is related to the effects of cytokines on skeletal muscles baracos et al 1983 proinflammatory cytokines including tnf- have been implicated in the breakdown of muscle proteins kotler 2000 fever and myalgia associated with respiratory tract infection may be caused by the production of prostaglandin e2 in response to cytokines baracos et al 1983 the cytokine-related synthesis of prostaglandin e2 and the breakdown of skeletal muscle has been inhibited in vitro by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and similarly fever and myalgia accompanying acute respiratory infection are relieved with acetylsalicylic acid a classic anti-inflammatory agent eccles et al 2003 since prostaglandin e2 is a pain mediator its increased synthesis may explain the myalgia associated with acute respiratory tract infectionsfever is a classic response to infection it is a manifestation of cytokine release in response to a variety of stimuli it is believed to be beneficial for the hosts response to infection cabanac 1990 eccles 2005 and is usually associated with novel or severe viral infections such as influenza monto et al 2000 consequently fever is a common symptom in infants probably because viruses responsible for acute respiratory tract infections are new to the infant and induce a strong immune response however in adults who had been exposed to numerous common cold viruses in the past subsequent infections do not elicit a strong cytokine response and fever is a rare symptom of a common cold in adults eccles 2005 on the contrary some patients experience a transient fall in body temperature during the early stages of acute benign respiratory tract infection and about 13 of all patients experience chills eccles et al 2003 chills associated with a fall in skin temperature related to vasoconstriction of the skins blood vessels may be explained as an initial stage of fever but chills may also be unrelated to changes in skin temperature chills have developed after administration of exogenous pyrogens even if the subjects maintained a neutral skin temperature 345 c in water in experimental human studies guieu and hellon 1980 chills occur together with shivering and the latter symptom is probably related to the cerebral cortex influence over the shivering control both chills and shivering may be caused by cytokines acting on the temperature control center of the hypothalamus many cytokines act as endogenous pyrogens and are released from leukocytes in response to infection conti et al 2004 the proinflammatory cytokines il-1 and il-6 are regarded as the most important cytokines for causing fever netea et al 2000 leon 2002 they are believed to cross the blood-brain barrier and increase the thermal set point in the temperature control center the hypothalamus then induces shivering constriction of the skins blood vessels and chills eccles 2005febrile seizures are a rare but significant symptom of acute viral respiratory infections in children they occur in 25  of all children and the majority of febrile seizures are triggered by respiratory tract infection schuchmann et al 2011 febrile seizures are defined as occurring in children aged 660 months with a temperature 380 c with no central nervous system infection metabolic disturbance or history of afebrile seizure they are the most common type of seizure in children under 60 months american academy of pediatrics 2011 graves et al 2012 cytokines seem to play a crucial role in febrile seizures however there is a lot of confusion about the relationship between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and the febrile seizure risk is it generally accepted that the genotype il-1-889 11 and il-1-511 tt homozygote as well as the serum concentration of il-6 are associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures saghazadeh et al 2014the treatment of acute viral respiratory tract infections remains primarily supportive there is evidence that medications like acetaminophen paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen or aspirin relieve some symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections fever sore throat pain and malaise but it is debatable whether symptomatic treatment could speed up recovery eccles 2005 many other common advices like drinking plenty of fluids or steam inhalation have not been scientifically proven some new agents seem to be promising for example in a study by asada et al 2012 l-carbocysteine reduced the baseline and rs virus infection-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1 il-6 and il-8 as well as virus titers in the supernatant of human tracheal epithelial cells culture although a virus-orientated approach and the development of anti-viral agents should be more beneficial the diverse etiology makes the development of universal antivirals highly unlikely passioti et al 2014since clinical symptoms are not sufficient to determine the etiology of acute viral respiratory tract infections we believe that the host defense mechanisms are critical to the symptomatology immune response seems to be fundamental for understanding the pathomechanisms of these infections inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and bradykinin are responsible for the local symptoms of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea while cytokines are responsible for systemic symptoms a better understanding of the immune response including cytokines interactions will eventually allow for better treatments to be developed and should improve the quality of care for patients with acute respiratory tract infections
